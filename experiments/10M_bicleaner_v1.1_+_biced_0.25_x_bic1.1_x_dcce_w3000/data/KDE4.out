the package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; by making them available more easily .
for further information on the use of &amp; S@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual at &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; to load , select Settings extensions ... open the menu map and select the modules you want .
this is a list with standard delivery modules from the box ; add add@@ ons . please note that you may have more modules on your system if you have installed additional software .
you should install the box base , the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click at the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; then you can view the page , the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of stor@@ my , if available , clear .
the module focuses ( also called folder filters ) you can arrive in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar with extras . with the module you can filter &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory on different types of filters .
to use the DO@@ M component in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the straight document . as a default , the display begins with the root content of the document , example : the element , all the other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root &apos;s no@@ de .
module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view for objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ Type / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbolic and text messages so as to view the contents of your local file system .
the distinctive feature of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in a scre@@ ened folder @-@ hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ map graphi@@ cally . each object is displayed by a rec@@ tan@@ gle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must feature that the sum of the size of the sub@@ ordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View , the size of a file or folder , the size of a folder , as the sum of the size of the entries is determined by it . thus , large files , even then can easily be recognized when they are far down in the folder hierarchy . thus , &amp; FS@@ View can be seen as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ at@@ ographic exposition represents a rec@@ tan@@ gle which represents a file or a folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles of meaningful colours and let@@ tering settings .
the colour of a rectangular area , which is inserted over view colour mode , can display either depth for the light detection of the put@@ ty or the illustration of a different file name such as name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type .
a rec@@ tan@@ gle can be lab@@ eled with the various properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each property you can specify , if enough space to display is available or if the surface area may be used by restrictions on the sign of the Tre@@ vor ) . besides , you can set the relative position of the let@@ tering in the rec@@ tan@@ gle .
when performing algorithms for tre@@ em@@ aps , the area should be respected that the area is proportional to the size of the item . at Tre@@ at@@ in &amp; FS@@ View ; this purpose is not always shown to provide the cas@@ ing entries of the entries and this framework require space , which then lost the sub@@ ordinate orders no longer . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rec@@ tan@@ gle square is square .
how split the area of an item for the sub@@ ordinate entries is provided , the implementation is left up . on this occasion , it is for the compl@@ ained boxes and for the avoidance of space losses by the means always divide the areas such as quad@@ rants that are as square . the best methods on this are lines , columns , or recur@@ sive dis@@ sec@@ tor@@ ment .
you can specify the minimal shown area for an entry of the menu item . instead , a smoking pattern in the area of the parent item is drawn to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an sub@@ ordinate entry .
originally &amp; FS@@ View was designed as a small review and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get , which was developed for the application of K@@ C@@ ach@@ e@@ gr@@ ind .
the module image can be found in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under extras image ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .

display the picture size of the picture to show whether the file size is displayed under thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
see the picture size picture shows whether the size of images is displayed under thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
in the dialog folder , you specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders should be included .
in file selection , saving in HTML file , enter where the HTML page is to be stored .
with the sub@@ cut@@ aneous sub@@ folder you can adjust with a sli@@ der or a swi@@ pe , up to which level the sub@@ folders are included .
copy the original images in the original pictures to copy whether the original images are to be copied into the gallery .
to use the commentary box file , you can specify a Com@@ mentary file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
in the cross @-@ section of our own color @-@ depth , you can specify a different color @-@ thumb@@ nail for the thumb@@ nails as well as in the original pictures .
the Module &amp; HTML ; settings offers you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under extras @-@ settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera records will be made available to you so that you can connect to your digital camera and download their photos directly in &amp; digi@@ tised . more than 1000 digital cameras will be supported by means of library services . of course , each medium and every card les@@ bian is supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ tised , working together .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; contains a fast image processing with basic image processing tools . you can use these to view your photos , comment , evaluate and correct . the processing capabilities can be easily extended with KDE Image plug @-@ ins ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ came ; easy to use is it makes use of professional skills available . it works completely in the 16 @-@ bit color space and all the available modules support the raw conver@@ ters using purple , DN@@ G @-@ Export and ICC @-@ colour administrative work@@ flow .
improved database with significantly more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; on the camera or the lens , which can be searched for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also digi@@ tization ; an open source project . that means , it is dependent on the assistance of the end users . they should therefore report issues and improvements .
&amp; digi@@ tization : tries to make the milking of problems or suggestions for making them as easy as possible for them . this opens a dialog with a underlined link . if you use these links , your web browser opens a page in the error system . all necessary information is listed here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ tization : is a project supported by a community . i.e. , the user and developer came to each other . if you came to a regular user mailing list by &amp; digi@@ tization . however , you may ask questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ tization . however , you will be able to answer questions about other users here . however , in this mail@@ ing@@ list is English spoken , you should therefore be powerful this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ tization page to visit the news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ tization .
the best start to take part in &amp; digi@@ tised , is the registration in the developer mailing list . guidance to log in the developer &apos;s mailing list for &amp; digi@@ tization ; .
if you start &amp; digi@@ tization ; for the first time start , you will be asked where to store your pictures and your database . you can choose a local , remote or remote folder , or simply click the folder icon symbol to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path will remain equal to all folders .
later , you can add as many folders as you wish . &amp; digi@@ tised , you will additionally use as an Al@@ ben@@ ign library . settings digi@@ put@@ am .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder , the pictures contains , as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ code ; considers any sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed . during the passage of the folder you will get a progress show like this :
&amp; digi@@ tor came ; dur@@ se re@@ cur@@ t the libr@@ arian in all its depth . you cannot finish any sub@@ folder , unless it list in hidden folder . this can be done by an extraordinary folder and checking out one point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you &apos;ll notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ ds do not take photos as symbols . you can change the copies of the album and put it on the folder symbol . this will then be used as an album icon . further details can be found in the albums icon .
once you configure the base folder , you can set in &amp; digi@@ tised , your digital camera . afterwards , you should learn how to use My albums and my keywords list to manage your photos in the albums .
Roh@@ dat@@ ei@@ Support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , you may also use it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the context of Cru@@ ci@@ d support .
how you set up this and work with shell files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ m and Ro@@ h work@@ flow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera records will be made available to you so that you can connect to your digital camera and download their photos directly in &amp; digi@@ tised . more than 1000 digital cameras will be supported by means of library services . of course , each medium and every card les@@ bian is supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ tised , working together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera then appears as a disk drive . the camera can also be realized through the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its derivatives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ tization : use Pro@@ Photo 2 to communicate with digital cameras , which has an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras . photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely spread protocol created by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to machines and other peri@@ pher@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with calcul@@ ator . since photos in general are large files and transmis@@ sions on the serial port , this connection has been de@@ prec@@ ated . &amp; digi@@ tised , supports these cameras and conduc@@ ts the transmission of images with photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
li@@ b@@ g@@ mental 2 must have been created with li@@ bex@@ change support . EX@@ IF support is not required by some li@@ b@@ g@@ mental 2 camera types in order to read the thumb@@ nails . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in li@@ b@@ g@@ ine 2 , you will be able to admit preced@@ ents or the production could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things about &amp; digi@@ tization is how easy it can extend its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the KDE Image plug @-@ ins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common modular structure for &amp; digi@@ tization . to develop K@@ Photo@@ CD , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the objective is to provide the modules for all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it &apos;s much simpler , &amp; digi@@ tization ; by writing a small modul to add a function when the changes came into &amp; digi@@ tised , even to perform .
to simplify the window , you can either switch the sides with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full @-@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
moving and drop off images works everywhere : you can take a picture in another part of the tree build , about the horizontal separation line or another application window . the only constra@@ int is that a picture can &apos;t be in keywords , date list or search .
- a file selection allows you to lift the wi@@ gs to you : JP@@ EG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the tool@@ bar . thus , the fil@@ ament works on the fil@@ en@@ ame only when this ind is displayed symbolic view as well . what fields will be displayed can you configure in the dialog &apos;s settings .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ l@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo@@ sets . these albums can be sorted by the folders , where they were stored on the hard disk , according to the name of their collection in the al@@ loc@@ alized properties or after the date , on which the album was first created , sorted . the date can be modified in the properties of the album .
if you have set up a scanner , you can scan the photo directly into an album . you can also scan the photograph directly to an album . choose the album impor@@ ter of the scre@@ enshot .
to move or move a picture from one album to another one , you can move the photo with your mouse on the target album and drop it down . you can also move the image by moving or copying them . simply select all photos and move it to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allowing you to give information about this collection . to access the album characteristics , you must click with the right mouse button on the album and edit the album menu Album Settings .
Albu@@ quer@@ - Collec@@ tions : are a method to highlight your albums , so you can select your photos by selecting from the tool@@ bar or view albums . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can make this in the settings for collections .
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date .
the buttons , average , neu@@ ester : this set the date on that of the oldest , the latest image or the average of the album . first , first tries to calculate the average of the pictures from its EX@@ IF data . if this fails , instead the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder .
if you first opened an album in &amp; digi@@ tised , the first image will be selected as a icon for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ l@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ l@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; This is to help you remember the photos of the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you &apos;ll need to click the image with the right mouse button , and in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview , you can select the photo on the album in the list to put it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in a collection and collections can not be cured .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; supports the input of key@@ word for individual photos in the area My key@@ word list below in the main window . album collections have another effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album . of course , you can use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images in this album are displayed in the image window . each photo will be displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of these curtains with the two lu@@ pin sni@@ pes in the tool@@ bar .
when you open an album the first time , you must wait around while the thumb@@ nails will be generated . you can avoid them in which you can create new thumb@@ nails .
information about each image is displayed below the file preview . what information it is , you can set up more about settings . choose here the albums page and customize the preview images to suit your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails disp@@ ose of a window . if you let the mouse cursor up a moment over a picture . the display shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the scre@@ enshot top in the window will display such a help window .
photos are all about what it was about &amp; digi@@ tization . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . the image editing features your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements on this site . you can reach all the features that with &amp; digi@@ tization . you can choose from the context menu of the preview or the menu image in the menu bar . you can choose between the viewing of images , a slide , or the processing of images .
you can open the picture editing with a photo by calling either F@@ 4 image editing ... or the right @-@ click menu of the image with the right mouse button . editing you can find a guide on how to edit your photos . with the image processing , you can view your photos and change them .
it may happen that &amp; digi@@ code came ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by clicking the right @-@ click menu with the right button of the button and adjust the program from the sub@@ menu . to do this , and how to adjust it to your needs if your program is not enumer@@ ated , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ not ; manual .
you should note that after editing different image processing programs can come to problems with the metadata included in the image . some programs do not store this data with you if you save the modified image . this will allow this information from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
&amp; nbsp ; provides two ways for rotation . the easiest way is to select the right mouse button on the thumb@@ nail , and select the rot@@ or . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , you can click with the right mouse button on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame in the context menu . please note that you keep the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc . ) .
if you have a photo taken from &amp; digi@@ tised , it will be moved in the du@@ st@@ bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 picture Dele@@ te or Ent@@ f Falls you prefer to delete , you can use this by Shift .
the view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ alo@@ l@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; organize your photos on the basis of the data . &amp; digi@@ came ; used to use either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification made by the file .
when you select a month from the list , all photos of this month are shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the dat@@ ashe@@ et below in the data sheets , so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown .
photos with keywords will provide a flexible and powerful way to organize your photos and catalog . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this sample or a search .
if a key@@ word is selected , all photos which have been marked with this key@@ word are displayed .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . thus , you can organize your keywords logic . you can also ring parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word scheme ; together , you can find the keywords you can easily find .
the tags are stored in a database for quick access and weigh@@ ed key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data areas of the image , at least for JP@@ EG , saved . so you can also use your keywords in other programs . also , the tags in the loss of the database re @-@ imported as soon as &amp; digi@@ came ; the images may notice .
you can add new tags by clicking with the right mouse button , either on &amp; quot ; My sample @-@ quot ; or an existing bu@@ zz@@ word . if you have a new key@@ word after you have clicked a new key@@ word after you have clicked on an existing key@@ word , this key@@ word is sent to this key@@ word .
you can delete a key@@ word by clicking the keywords with the right mouse button and select . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself is not deleted . only the keywords will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a key@@ word by taking it to the desired location in the tree and drop there . then a menu that gives you the possibility to move the key@@ word . a key@@ word can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the characteristics of a key@@ word by clicking it with the right mouse button and edit in the context menu . you can change the name of the key@@ word and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My sample @-@ quot ; change .
to select another photo as an album icon , you &apos;ll need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu as an album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to take advantage of the functionality using key@@ word ; first you have to take your photos with key@@ word . this can be done in two ways : once you choose the photos , you can click the key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word ; alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the images and select from the context menu .
you can choose a photo with any number of tags . the photo will be shown as soon as you choose one of the keywords for each person in a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made , etc .
once you have provided a photo with key@@ word , this is displayed under the preview of the picture in the main window .
you can remove a key@@ word in which you can open the right @-@ click context menu of the photos and choose from the keywords menu . the menu only shows you the keywords which have been assigned to the photo .
the time@@ frame view shows a delay on the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can click on this hist@@ o@@ gram . to select a time frame , you just need to click on the bottom right of the selection frame which displays the time unit . thus , all associated pictures are displayed in the main window .
in the box below you can enter a title and save your selection . then it appears in the list below .
include all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamp and in the future even more .
Neb@@ end he search box is a small lamp the green is found when searching for results . if you click here the filtering will be cleared and all images appear again . if the search has not found , then the lamp is red .
the advanced search tool is hidden in the rider in the left side@@ bar with the tel@@ esc@@ ope . if you open this , you can save a simple search box like the one described above . you can search this search here but as live search that was always fil@@ tered out what you have entered as a search crit@@ erion . after you saved the f@@ d filter found in the list .
if you are satisfied with your choice , press the head OK and the search is done . the results are displayed in my search list in the main window . the text@@ box query as being used to submit your request a name in My search list , you only need to select the corresponding entry in my search box and select an option in his context menu .
when you select searching , the form to enter the search returned with the previous search information . in case you select As an advanced search , the dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search . here you will find more rules for search . further information can be found in Section The tool for Advanced Search .
if you want to delete an existing search out of the list , select from the context menu search .
the Advanced Search will provide you with an extended search form with many search parameters that you entered in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ tization ; s database can be found .
the list of search rules is used to create the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . all rules will be added to , by operators . any option may link with other information about the logical operations . ... , One ... , No ... or Mind@@ mon@@ h ... link . in addition , you can create search type &amp; quot ; AND CA@@ ND@@ ING ;
&amp; digi@@ tization ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these sig@@ natures . the smaller the difference between two image natures , the more they meet . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is a section in which you can drop any picture in order to find a similar one . by means of a swelling , the result options can be magni@@ fied or reduced . if you push a picture from somewhere over the symbol of un@@ precise search in the left side@@ bar , then this will open up and you can drop it there .
sketch : open @-@ hand colour : draw a quick sketch and design ; finds the matching photos . also here , one can be set .
this rider is an intuitive look @-@ based tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ van . you can press and drag C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse kno@@ b around a square . all pictures inside this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course , this requires your pictures of ge@@ o data .
in the field below , you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this is then added for a later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ folder .
digi@@ tization has come in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , also shell files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em lighthouse , added from the context menu . the choice will be added to the light table and its window opened . if you are in the way again ; main window , you can open the illumin@@ ate fast with L extras .
the thumb@@ nail , you can compare the images you want to compare , in the left or right area of the window and disc@@ ard it . if you want to select a copy of the tool@@ bar and perform a zoo or di@@ version along one of the images , then you will be able to compare the same domain of the two images .
another mode is better suited to quickly choose from a picture series . if you &apos;re using pairs to navigate out of tool@@ bar , then the two first pictures are automatically displayed in the area . use the left mouse button at any preview to display it in the left area . this simplified it easier to work through a number of similar pictures .
obviously , the normal sol@@ vers are also working directly from the lumin@@ ous as for example F@@ 4 file mach@@ ining ....
all pictures from the right side bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails in the light table . this makes it e.g. simply visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each range , you will find a built @-@ in swing function , which you like to wi@@ pe out to the visible area . to hold the visible area of the image , you need to click this click and the &amp; L@@ MB ; hold down . in the mode preview , then both images will show the same image area .
zo@@ oming is just as shown in other views . just use the zo@@ oming rider under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; Maus@@ er to take into the image and out and out . this happens in both images if you &apos;re in the mode thumb@@ nails .
what is a digital analysis - away from the process ? digital drawing is considered every part of the process that was taken up to the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the photos takes , sc@@ anned or digital photos , introduces a form of digital inventory . however , most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool to secure a plan and practical advice on how to secure your pictures , protect , protect and use photos . we consider downloading , re @-@ design@@ ate , remove , re@@ group@@ ing , backup , backup , stream@@ lining , optimize , waiting , waiting , and export of image files .
&amp; quot ; dig@@ al inventory is placed on , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , minim@@ ized , designs , transformed , ready @-@ assembled , and exports material that have a mon@@ astic or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is provided in accordance with your definition data that will provide information about or using any information provided by an application or environment .
I dare to claim if you don &apos;t even need more than 1000 photos on your machine , then you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you definitely don &apos;t use &amp; digi@@ tization . . the approach to store metadata in a database as well as in image files guarantees very quick search and a secure archiving to access you with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you do and need to know before you &apos;re getting around into your system is building information structure unlike your computer . you must decide whether other access to your photos have to be saved or on a network drive , etc . please note that you eventually have to switch to a larger drive .
maybe you &apos;ll be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly through your storage place . if you have enough photos on the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg . 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; use . then export a folder for images that you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements like version@@ ing the photos , archiving , working practices , const@@ ants of pictures on different topics and a large number of all . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % of work files will have and you will not want to re @-@ organise your structure for this content .
which types of files fit together ? the separation of data types makes the st@@ acking process easier . separate new old files .
the separation of original and working files simplify a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you &apos;re looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
we also recommend the option metadata to be saved in the file page of metadata in &amp; digi@@ s. it ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forget this , then you can save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the relevant item on the menu album .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what if you want to change ? to add a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes , these are of course the most important ones .
now begin the real work , as you should now select any photo keywords , marking and evaluation . of course , you can select all the images that require the same attribute and then set the value . you start best with the rating or the ranking . this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos while further work .
let us now let us communicate with keywords , keywords or categories as you continue with other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then , &amp; digi@@ tised , automatically insert the tree for you . converting the hierarchy inside the tree is no problem and can simply be done by pulling a sub@@ tree on another . the changed keywords will be checked by &amp; digi@@ tised , and while the sub @-@ trees are persecuted .
the graphic shows how different metadata trans@@ forms itself . this is a very rough representation as each block of metadata in truth consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and cal@@ ender dates are properties of all images .
enough the keywords - the next section refers to marking or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to see most nobody to see your photos just , you want to share it with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in how your photos will arrive .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you consider it closer you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say you this the Lan@@ de@@ platz of Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing is . wow ! you begin to dream of associations , memories , the historic period of time is again present , you might even hear the silence . the cap@@ tion has changed your perception of this panor@@ amas .
for others who consider your photos the title is perhaps more important than the picture itself to produce an interest . if you show pictures , you should transfer a story . remember , the key is to transfer to Him through the moti@@ f you are moving has to understand what you understand .
it is fine when a picture is not perfect , if it has the strength only to work with a let@@ tering for himself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ tization ; you can use as much text as possible , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as let@@ tering . you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time . KDE , you can even tell your images in the let@@ tering and / or the title of the web @-@ system system . so you have to tell the story so for the opening of the web @-@ system .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it not a te@@ dious Planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ am ? good , because with pictures the train of spatial presentation now starts with speed .
the possibilities that exploit the ge@@ olo@@ alization are already innumerable and will continue in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can open your travels with Google Earth . you can then also download photos at reception . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc . , with the google@@ maps .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a vocabulary with copyright and describes the practice to use copyright laws to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions , thus also for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information in the furnishings of &amp; digi@@ tization came ; as information deposited :
author ( syn@@ onym for creators and writers ) : this field should include your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo , e.g. to protect the photographer &apos;s identity , then the name of a company or organisation may be used . after which this value has been saved , it should not be changed . this field does not support com@@ mas or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
author@@ title ( syn@@ onym for editor ) : associated with the author . examples of this field contains the photographer , photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or Independent photographer . since this is a note to the author &apos;s field , this field has to be completed .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the provider for identifying who the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photograph is listed here for a news agency such as Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press , then those organizations can be listed here . if the image is a bearing photo , then the group / agency provides the picture here .
it &apos;s very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this can not provide protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computer can delete , delete or change the solution to this problem are digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this protection is only very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is extremely important .
the digital water@@ marks is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ tization ; in the near future there will be such a module for st@@ ack@@ able processing .

of course we do not talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these types of losses are the same which can also happen in traditional paper sn@@ ap@@ shots or neg@@ atives . this section deals with problems with the mentioned new media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data collection in the world , has some interesting statistics which reasons a data loss has .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , those cautious but you cannot buy CDs and DVDs in archi@@ val quality . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archives . there are offers above gold coated DVDs , and dollar ; 2 the piece which claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe it is in your surve@@ ying room .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you can use good discs and good shooting devices and take them in the right way . the best DVD cap@@ sized equipment are not significantly more expensive than the cheapest but you can write much more reliable . therefore , it is therefore getting the right choose .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to mistakes , even if you have just been written . therefore , use a control mechanism to protect yourself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control . despite this massive protection they age through chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for faul@@ ty CDs and DVDs there is a favourable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which seems to do wonders amongst CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but there are also similar applications to read the def@@ ective data from damaged flo@@ ppies , hard@@ disks , flas@@ hes , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs appear to save the forman@@ t war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can save 50 GB and therefore nearly sixty volumes the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.@@ 5 GB . all that is said to CDs and DVDs was obviously also applied to the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good reception desk on high @-@ quality media in a not propri@@ ate format . simply read the media with a description , date &amp; author features and after that in a clean , dark yellow and before animals protected place . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can be read through the media .
disco@@ s keep your statistics for yourself . your manufacturer &apos;s @-@ may include a new disk , but not the data . Google has a large field study on the error mechanisms of HD@@ Ds available on this topic : dis@@ fault
in brief , Dis@@ ks keep the longest when you operate in the temper@@ ate area of 35 ° C up to 45 ° C . at low Temper@@ ature , the most common error @-@ item , SM@@ ART may not notice this error . some of the SM@@ ART failures announce the immediate immediate emergency . these are particularly les@@ bi@@ kers and aband@@ on@@ ment periods . the expected life time amounts between 4 and 5 years .
this is the overall loss of losses due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to an electricity failure before you backup the files , but these losses normally can be made without big problems .
while most electrical equipment does not account much , this can decrease in devices with computer chips and high speed processors . these can cause heavy damage . at your computer these anom@@ ali@@ es have blocked keyboard , complete data loss , hardware replacement , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . therefore , protect yourself from the un@@ avoidable results in a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against rap@@ es@@ tips is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absorbed a part of the energy @-@ heat and the rest is det . it is usually available in the form of a steel bar . remember , however , that not every stat@@ ec@@ ker@@ bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to it that he offers the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also be careful to protect the protection against ligh@@ tening and thus protects the properly attached devices .
as an over@@ voltage each cable may use to your computer , you should note that also all peri@@ pher@@ als which are connected to your system . this also applies to phone pi@@ pelines and cable mo@@ de@@ ms since also included a phone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axi@@ al cable of cable @-@ mo@@ de@@ ms and TV menu .
if you have a notebook then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks and therefore contain very small and you also contain the protection for the modem . so you &apos;re ideal for travel .
while an over@@ voltage protection your system protects against smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete breakdown . even an exit from a few seconds can cause the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . therefore , it can be useful to invest in a fragile power supply .
besides the protection from over@@ voltage , these devices may automatically transfer cordless energy . this gives you the possibility to store your data and run the system ordered again . if you buy a US@@ V then you should be sure that they comply with the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the attached software is interesting .
concern you the potential risk that your billing system is exposed and compare its security at blackout with the cost of avoiding this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 40 get . this is only a small price difference when you remember how well your machine is protected by it . at the end you should always remember all the cable before you go to the holiday .
the Amazon Web Service contains S@@ 3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service . with the right configuration you can integrate it as drive under &amp; Linux ; Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup target for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
they are , however , very expensive compared to the hard drives , but very expensive - 40 GB of dollars , 75 per year and 400 GB costs . 500 . in addition , you have to send the data about the compar@@ atively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general secure solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo @-@ community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online store services that are limited to photos . your free memory is not available in full resolution online . the professional variant will provide you more available , in case of Flickr you will get unlimited memory , which should be checked in reality first .
from the perspective of data security , the Web @-@ solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies is available in the offering to secure and a shared memory . thus , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ proof .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transmis@@ sions are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem and b@@ tr@@ fs make at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive safely .
the worst thing is that no one says when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all of these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ detected until you have no protection for it . nobody seems to have no protection for it . nobody seems to have thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a significantly safer data path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power parts are another source of transmission loss as they create interactions within the data streams . on normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not currently affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors each year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle records on low levels and are highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GPL licensed license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon also available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its sub @-@ resolution file system . it is still in the Alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms that are used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; it is not yet part of the kernel .
under@@ estimate this not ! these two factors are for 86 % of the data loss in the notebook and 46 % responsible for the work@@ load systems . at Not@@ ebooks , the proportion of th@@ ef@@ ts is already 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most of the seas . it results in a lower damage , such as theft or re@@ plac@@ ements . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has been no longer seen for a long time .
open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal , better than ext@@ 3 , rout@@ ing , J@@ FS and X@@ FS , to call the com@@ ets file systems . a very good English articles can be found here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupted data and loss of data : wrong , just the speed of the investigation process in a sudden break during an operation is higher and a in@@ defin@@ able status will be avoided . if a file was not completely saved before the problem came up , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft , and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings of fundamental physical limits . it is that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and drugs character@@ ize for all types of light @-@ sensors are not far away from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go into the direction of 10 meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel and the end result would be worse for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras did your limit at 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or bigger formats .
so do you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone else responsible for data loss . thus , 6 % of all PCs are often affected by any loss of data . so you can easily back up your data according to a plan and test this backup before you do something more dangerous than the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of plates or the sizes of hard@@ disks .
suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external USB drive every day . if , then one day , a flash suggests you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster is falling locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft un@@ happiness : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the complete house .
therefore disaster @-@ prevention always means a not local storage . bring your back@@ ups the stairs , to the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as stated above , a common reason for a loss of data despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that are to be secured . it is a snapshot of a history , and represents a complete copy of one point in time .
differential security : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup has been made . creates a complete snapshot of the two time points : one of the total @-@ to @-@ end backup and that of the last differenti@@ ations .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since last backup has been made . you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup was made . this backup comes the next one with the exception that it only cured and is not constant .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool you can easily set up on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer @-@ script copied r@@ sync only the difference of files that were really changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security on ssh .
secure important pictures directly after you have stored them on your computer to a DVD or other visual medium .
this procedure leaves you enough time to discover losses and restore it . at the same time you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . in the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot of for at least a month and a snapshot of each month . every additional th@@ inner should be done manually after you have made a complete review .
themes : metadata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , association X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re @-@ find pictures and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visual devices , ... , use of Internet .
so that valuable images can survive the next 40 year that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predictable from your nature , you need to consider everything today . unfortunately , there is no other option as a certain aler@@ tness to leave . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system are back@@ wards . the less variants you have used in the past , the more easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switching to open standards which are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is nowadays for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to reading your pictures , then preserve it and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : each time you change your computer architecture , your memory and safety technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the ability to change a system in its size . this means actually getting bigger .
let &apos;s assume that you plan the scal@@ ability with you and want to enlarge the area that you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition . with * nix systems such as &amp; Linux , you can copy this area and shift it to a new record :
check with the command that your new record was detected by the system , but do not hang them up .

open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read , then you can create them yourself . this task will be made from year to year .
gif is a proprietary , patented format that is slowly disappears from the market . therefore , it should not use it anymore .
P@@ NG was developed as an open source standard designed to replace G@@ IF . it can save a lot more . it is los@@ ers , supports X@@ MP , extru@@ der and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG may need gam@@ ers and chro@@ mati@@ cal data for improved color information , but not as many as TI@@ FF required and a slow maturity . this format will we recommend you to save your pictures .
TI@@ FF was widely used as picture format . TI@@ FF may be stored into un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss @-@ free compression rate ( de@@ fl@@ ate ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . with some cameras , you can store your pictures in this format . therefore , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The Digit@@ ale Neg@@ ative file format is developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G has been developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G is already available on the TI@@ FF / EP format and is committed to using metadata . DN@@ G is already available for DN@@ G already and we hope that the competitors of Canon and Nik@@ on will use it sometime .
this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is enabled with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; saved the for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive a original of your shot , mostly in the raw @-@ format , to archi@@ ved . X@@ MP , however , because the metadata changes separately from the image file . therefore , you should consider if you use DN@@ G as container and put everything there together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to compatible online metadata standards that involve a large area of use and modelling , discussion and collaborative work in D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI tasks , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata and practices .
import images from the camera , the ticket les@@ bian or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera to use , you can use it as temporary backup .
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save them in your raw archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for a fin@@ ely editing process , you can use external programs . if you edit the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ tised , then you should add the metadata again . these have some circumstances cut off from other programs .
protect the processed images for the copyright with a digital water@@ marks . simply export it to Web@@ gal@@ as , bo@@ de in MPEG , use in contact sheet , print &amp; etc .
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ tised . in the section adding a photo to an album you can add a description , as you have photos which you already have on your hard drive , but you can add many advanced settings to import@@ ing images to your al@@ locate database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tization ; to use , connect these with the machine , turn the camera on the ad mode , and turn it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect it with your camera . for some cameras , this may take a while . if the connection is made , a skill indicator appears at the bottom and thumb@@ nails will be available . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for file data is displayed for each file , photos , movies , music etc .
before you download the photos on your computer , you might need the camera information about each entry . with the page features and metadata from the camera interface you can see the characteristics of one item or its metadata .
this dialog shows file characteristics and the photo information stored internally by the camera . an icon shows that the image is not downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras did not make all the information available .
the rider Met@@ adata shows the internal metadata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer notice , GPS etc . , the same as the metadata bar on the main window of &amp; digi@@ tization . please note that metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is click on the button to download and then download the selection from all . this invites all photos from her camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ tised . in downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the photos were downloaded safely to an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired ones with the default options of &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the button download and then download the selected button . the button chosen will download as long as you selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . these pictures have not been downloaded by &amp; digi@@ tization . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview of it . if you choose this option , of course , only the new images are downloaded .
when you use the buttons All or downloaded the buttons , appears a dialog , with which you can select the target album , displayed in which the photos are sorted . the list of existing albums is shown , as regular folders . select the finish album from the list and press OK .
after you have selected the home album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ came ; invites the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once , by delete the button delete . if you only want to delete some , you must first select it and delete it afterwards .
note that there is no possibility to recover from the camera , restore it . so , the photos are not removed in the du@@ st@@ bin of &amp; k@@ de ; so they should check carefully before you delete them from the camera . if you want to completely delete them from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera system , then you should do so much faster .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually again recycled , after the photographs have been deleted from the camera . therefore , it can be useful , the date and time when the picture was taken to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirror @-@ based sub@@ categories . if you use this latter option , a folder per day will be automatically created .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three further options that are performed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two are related to the data about the author standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty . if you choose this , the corresponding entries are copied from the EX@@ IF data into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct the date &amp; time available for all downloaded pictures .
if you want another disk @-@ format as the standard format , you can e.g. in the processing field the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % % H : % M : % S . turn it on the option date &amp; time . for further modifications you should read the help Command Pro@@ f@@ time .
if you use the option camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ame in lo@@ wer@@ case letters , or case letters , if you prefer this .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ came ; for a photo , is displayed below the name that displays the camera in the preview . your settings for ren@@ ame are saved and automatically used when you open the next time the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; can provide any information about the orientation of the camera to the point of recording , to carry out a automatic spin during downloading . not all cameras will provide this information . in the side@@ bar metadata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera is embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually turned on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t generate this information , the photo is in original orientation . if you want to switch off the automatic spin turn , use the button Advanced and select the automatic turn on the bottom of the window .
if your camera records information about the date , which the photo has been made available , can use &amp; digi@@ tization . these subjects are based on the image data . all pictures with the same date are downloaded in the same sub@@ album . not all cameras will display this information . in the side@@ bar met@@ a data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is normally off , and in this case , &amp; digi@@ came ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option and select the option data @-@ based sub@@ directories at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the button download . select then upload . the file optional dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files up@@ loaded , which is to be up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file with the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods select .
after the selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ tised , you where the images are to be loaded up . a folder @-@ selection dialog appeared for the camera . select the folder you want to download and press OK to load the upload . the images won &apos;t be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general concept in this document . thus , a position is meant to be displayed in long@@ itude and latitude . identifying the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photographers can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to sc@@ rub an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten later on where exactly the photo was made , you can send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ code . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ code readers , who would like to locate the location of the photos , or just save this aspect , it &apos;s good to get the position of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data arrive in the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 are many GPS data fields such as direction , se@@ pul@@ el@@ ites and card@@ holder &apos;s refer@@ enced . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a CO@@ IP@@ I module for geographic assignment ( manual ) and last over the manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there are currently no camera , which has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS recept@@ ors . either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : co@@ y@@ ote@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nik@@ on DS@@ LR ri@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ p@@ sman or ps@@ ba@@ bel . you need to save these data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the module to geographic assignment .
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract data from images and from GPS and cor@@ relate it . on the following page you can get the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ photo
if you know the long@@ itude and latitude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool of Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the signs that are created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ google.com shows no European road cards . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all the navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; try to give you so much control over his work processes as possible ; change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ tization . to access these settings , you need to set up settings in eight pages . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
action can be selected based on an em@@ be@@ et preview or picture editing . you are laying down the standard behaviour of &amp; digi@@ tised , notes if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the Stand@@ ardi@@ zed and copyright data . this data is automatically selected in the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields , if the option is selected by downloading the camera system . also with a database synchron@@ ization , these data are written in the IP@@ TC fields .
author@@ title is a syn@@ onym for fibre @-@ foot@@ er : this field should be the professional photographer of photographer . these can be desig@@ nations like e.g. An@@ ch@@ ained photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or more independent , commercial photographer . since this is a detailed description of the author , this also has to be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo program like e.g. Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be registered here as this is the image of the other &amp; quot ; an@@ bi@@ eten@@ quot ; . if the image is a bearing photo , the group or agency that the picture should be available here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data into the appropriate IP@@ TC Fel@@ ber . it is achieved that metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ tised . these metadata also have other programs and can be imported and imported into &amp; digi@@ tised .
images can be saved as an em@@ bed@@ bug ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JP@@ EG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you embedded in the pictures . this can also be read by other ima@@ gery in the pictures . caution : when images , which are already included , these texts will be over@@ subs@@ cribed .
the page Settings contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse cursor in the main window above a file rests . depending on the model chosen , this information will be displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ tization ; supports a number of different image formats and some video formats and audio formats . to specify , which file types &amp; digi@@ tization . to specify , which file types has to add and remove . each file has been added in a &amp; digi@@ tised . Albu@@ quer@@ ner who has none of these extensions , ignored by &amp; digi@@ tised ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Re@@ fresh right of each category .
the configuration of the lumin@@ aire of &amp; digi@@ tization ; can then be set on this page . each time you can then open the lumin@@ aire . however , some images do have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the full size lad@@ en@@ quot ; you should only use on fast machines . if you have one , then you can obtain a better view results .
by default , the image editing a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can select the tool@@ bar if you use the tool@@ bar in full @-@ screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or light colour in the picture . these colors will be fixed here . in the image processing this image can be used with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 and be switched off .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling , it means that images are coded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in color formations . please read this article in Wikipedia about the closer explanation .
with the setting P@@ NG compres@@ sing you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation is not reduced the image quality since P@@ NG used a loss @-@ free algorithm . if you have a quick machine , you can set this value to high compression . thereby , 1 : a low and 9 high compression .
with the option TI@@ FF files compressed , you can turn the de@@ fl@@ ate -@@ compression laser for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of TI@@ FF images . it does not affect the image quality , as the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm calcul@@ ates hard @-@ free .
with the attitude towards loss of loss JP@@ EG @-@ 2000 files you can be los@@ s@@ free . even if you have been the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JP@@ EG . when this paragraph has been written , metadata had not yet been supported , but it was in the planning .
in the previous versions of &amp; digi@@ tised , image processing was just a picture for photos . currently it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing .
the standard sampling is that all green pixels are equal . if the low @-@ line green pixels of the C@@ CD sensor is responding to sensitive coll@@ isions in output . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option draws the picture a little soft , elimin@@ ates the 2@@ x@@ 2 gene pattern using the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD video method .
if this option is set , the white axis is used immediately by the camera . otherwise , the automatic colour balance is used .
this setting is only used when the whit@@ eboard is not set . standard is it a solid colour balance , that was photographed on a white map that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super C@@ CD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that inf@@ erior images in four steps more details in the spotlight . for other cameras , this option will be ignored .
the standard is the mir@@ ac@@ ter , so the parts of your images are burned down , because of the in@@ ability of your camera to capture the Spit@@ lich@@ és . use the setting colours generates some unusual results , as it shows the pointed @-@ light in various ros@@ at@@ ches . finally , you can try some parts of the missing information from the mir@@ r@@ ers to re@@ construct .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast sati@@ ated as green and red . &amp; digi@@ die therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red shares of the not saturated blue pixel . obviously , this is a question how much color or wh@@ ites you want .
when you select the option re@@ construct , you get the possibility to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and / should therefore be adapted individually for each picture individually .
put the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to put it slightly higher than standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ tization . to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ B@@ icing , you should proceed more conserv@@ atively .
a dem@@ os@@ a@@ B@@ icing @-@ algorithm is a digital image process to get a complete picture from the sub @-@ fil@@ tered image sensor which has many cameras and is known from a matrix color@@ fully pixels . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ bre@@ construction .
&amp; digi@@ pack came ; and D@@ cra@@ w make you three alternatives available : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( Variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color @-@ initiation of your lenses you can put the red and blue @-@ proo@@ fre@@ aders here . this is certainly the best method for a color configuration , as you are performed while the shell is implemented .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to get there again . there are also L@@ CMS and digi@@ tization . information like the color informations of a farms in the other are possible to translate the colors as accurately as possible .
the behavior questions , if an image is opened in image processing , will start the &apos; color &apos; module with shell files .
colour profile folder : here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where all of your profiles have been saved . &amp; digi@@ code ; investig@@ ates this folder during the start .
settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed in the opening of the raw file later .
the view view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures and do not manage the entire screen .
the input profiles should be used to the camera buyer and model that you are using . not all profiles are included in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not have any color TV or gam@@ ers . currently , the cra@@ w Gamma does not have to perform for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means you must carry out the color binary yourself .
there are more options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile to em@@ ulate what your image would be given back from one device . this is very useful before you print images because your printer can operate a smaller color area as your camera and some colors therefore very saturated . this could you fix manually , instead of rel@@ ying on the flas@@ hes &apos;s algorithm .
for most cameras it is quite obvious which color @-@ profile is intended for them for what is . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here are a table of cameras and profiles which fit together . of course this answer is un@@ officially :
the Canon profile extension makes the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portraits and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin interface . it is an interface that can be supported by a number of &amp; kg ; image concerned and image editing . many modules support that were written to work with each program , which supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you &apos;ll see a list of available modules . select the one you want to use , and these will then be loaded by &amp; digi@@ tised . these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and additionally you will find some also in the context menu of the fores@@ kin .
short @-@ commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under settings short @-@ warran@@ ted .
for further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I @-@ modules you can get via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals for the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slides should be simple to understand . the upper limit regul@@ ates the time between the image out@@ ings , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other cross @-@ fields turn the metadata one or which ends at the bottom of the images displayed during the ad .
the camera properties displayed on the left of a list of all the currently supported cameras . on the right hand there is a button Autom@@ atic recognition , which is working on the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in image mode . beneath these are the port settings . currently , serial ports , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage devices are supported .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) -@@ mass storage @-@ c@@ anned camera from the camera screen . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / re@@ tool@@ ing , where you adjust your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tization ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , install it in the ad mode , and turn it on .
check if &amp; digi@@ tised you see ; the camera will automatically recognize it . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the menu camera .
you can select any name for your camera , and it &apos;s displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert it here .
with the option of veri@@ fying dialog for the moving from &gt; images in the du@@ st@@ bin , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ tised , del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the sections dele@@ tion of a photo and del@@ eting a album you find more details .
the editorial changes through the right side bar can be used in silent by &amp; digi@@ tization ; if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without resi@@ dual questions , otherwise you need to apply changes with the button changes .
you can also set up the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ tization . these will acceler@@ ates the start @-@ up process of &amp; digi@@ tization .
the setting can be searched for new photos &amp; digi@@ tised , the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos ; this prolon@@ gs the start time of &amp; digi@@ tised . if something from the base folder has been deleted , asks &amp; digi@@ tised , you whether to delete it from the database .
different shades are in &amp; digi@@ tised ; they are used to adjust the main window to suit your tastes . these settings can select you under settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs will be considered below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for publication , you will find more information about it in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and to improve and improve . image editing can be started by one click with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the item View / Edit menu .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ tization . therefore , they may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules you can set up in the picture editing section .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current date number , enlar@@ ging factor , and the current size picture shows .
a menu bar on the top edge , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most common functions required .
the editing functions of picture editing changes your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before saving file saving or saving the button save from the tool@@ bar . note that you cannot restore your original photo once you saved the image .
so you should possibly create a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it with File save .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the fil@@ esystem path or re @-@ establish the button . you then lose any change that you have done on the photo since the last time .
virtually any action of picture editing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action you can und@@ o by selecting mach@@ ining and recre@@ ated by selecting mach@@ ining from the menu .
if you often use this , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to the re@@ fine and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ um@@ old @-@ Z to re@@ produces .
if you select the &amp; L@@ MB , using the back @-@ back or Rest@@ ore button in the tool@@ bar you can press a right @-@ click menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all the actions in between are revers@@ ed or restored .
once you start editing picture , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navig@@ ational features in tool@@ bar , image high , picture down or the entries in the menu file . if you have made changes to the current photo , you are asked if you want to save them .
you can enter the photo in and out of zo@@ oming in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; Maus@@ er or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the menu @-@ menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can select this button in the tool@@ bar : enlarge factor automatically .
view full screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode . you come to the normal view where you use the Es@@ c button . usually , the tool@@ bar is displayed . if you do not want this , you can call it in the dialog dialog of &amp; digi@@ tization . you can view this section for editing content .
if you want to print the current image , you can select the image in the File menu and get the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; press dialog . you can adjust here the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or whole sentences . all image boards can be printed from your choice . you only need to select the images using the standard method and select from the menu album ex@@ porting printing material . if you follow the assistant you just need to hit your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ entered ; main window has a side bar on the right edge , which provides important information and promotions available for the selected images . the same page bar is available without the navig@@ ational fig@@ s , also available in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five hor@@ semen is clicked on :
multi@@ f@@ aches clicking on the same rider can be appearing on the side@@ bar or disappear again into the edge .
in the marking view you can type or insert marking with unlimited size . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tures are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ T and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields to allow you to be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support AS@@ C@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut after 2000 characters and special characters are revers@@ ed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC appeal box in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you have commented on you either use the button or simply switch to the next picture , the conf@@ uses will then be stored .
in addition to the use @-@ button , there is a button . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata to the files . however , this will always be done if you have selected a metadata set that is always written in the pictures .
the review indicates a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in seeking and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars on the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select it and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field . coding follows the diagram in the following table :
the keywords will display a search box to the filtering the keywords , the keywords and a drop box with the before in this &amp; digi@@ code ; -@@ session set the keywords .
the key@@ word is dynam@@ ically adapted to the search word . you can restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a key@@ word . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom is a further relief in entering keywords at a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , these are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by mark@@ ers of the appropriate cross areas in the tree . all the keywords of an image are stored into the IP@@ TC field Key@@ word .
when multiple images are selected in the main view and choose a key@@ word in the keywords , this only applied to the highlighted picture and not applied to the entire selection , if you wish to provide a selection with a key@@ word , please refer to the keywords filter .
the page tim@@ eline filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side@@ bar with their album , file , key@@ word and view@@ points are used . if in addition one or more key@@ word filter is used from the right , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all keywords are available .
you can also drag and disc@@ ard . suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view . if the key@@ word does exist , you can simply drag it out of the right side bar and put on the selection . ther@@ eu@@ pon , a dialogue window you ask if you want to place the bu@@ zz@@ word .
in the top example shows the main window showing the pictures on a calendar day . the key@@ word is no keywords , which is reduced the amount of three images . they were pulled with C@@ tr@@ l + a , and after that a key@@ word is drawn from the right bank @-@ tree to the choice and put it there . a dialog asks if this key@@ word is to be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched from different settings .
if you have a rule and have created and notice that it should be one or its needs , you can easily change it with double @-@ clicking on the text and on the rule section .
( 1 ) : the entry to be searched for in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , picture , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , set already in the database .
for example , you can set up a Advanced search for all the elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need the cross @-@ box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . see the options as follows :

this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly made it up &amp; digi@@ tised , s specified implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed work@@ flow , the colors that vary from your camera or scanner is a predictable devi@@ ation from the actually photographed and sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed work@@ flow , you can reach that the colors displayed on your monitor of your camera or scanner and the colours you print or publish in the Web out of your digital dark@@ room .
when the topic comes out on colour management , everyone wants to know what buttons it wishes to press . unfortunately , the meaning of this tutorial is made available to you on every point of the image processing work@@ flow . the meaning of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about colour management . in addition , you should make links with more deep information to make your own informed decisions and thus obtain the desired result .
when your work@@ flow offers all the criteria listed above , you do not have to worry about colour management .
you will work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ R@@ GB far@@ wers . ( further information can be found below )
your only other picture expenditure is by email or the Web where s@@ R@@ GB of de @-@ facto standard is .
so if S@@ R@@ GB works so well and makes life for everyone so simple , why should you use another color space and thus have thoughts about colour management ?
a visual example of the Lim@@ itation of s@@ R@@ GB compared with the colors that we really can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ hoe region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB farms , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ Dimen@@ sional Re@@ presentation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger colour spaces , then visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om excell@@ ente site and click on info and then on Information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
must I kal@@ li@@ fy my monitor when I decided to work only in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ el ?
yes ! whether you &apos;re working in s@@ R@@ GB @-@ bre@@ wers or not , you must cut your monitor cal@@ li@@ bri@@ tish , since s@@ R@@ GB works out of your monitor . so when you work in the R@@ GB of s@@ R@@ GB , you must either use your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool presents five automatic correc@@ tions available , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before you try a further manual work .
the functions norm@@ alize , lowering , automation and contrast expand the menu of correc@@ ting automatic correc@@ tive correction automatically from your colors the best to make . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alized : this method holds the lumin@@ ance control over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without changing its color sha@@ ding . this function is often a magnet correction for images that are dark or washed out .
the same : this method j@@ us@@ her@@ ded the ligh@@ tness factor of the colors of the selected image , allowing the hist@@ o@@ gram of intention to increase the same number of pixels . sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrac@@ tion of a picture , sometimes it produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that can either causes wonders in one image or destroyed .
automatic reck@@ less : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue @-@ channel . it det@@ ects the dark and bright boundary tones and j@@ us@@ hed the red , green@@ - and blue @-@ channels on the complete hist@@ o@@ gram .
contrast expand : this method improves the contrast and light of the R@@ GB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest value in the widest possible area and a re@@ tin@@ ting of all values in between . this is only visible in washed pictures and can be a good correction for poor photos .
the white @-@ comparison of &amp; digi@@ came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the tin@@ ting straight out of a photo .
the white @-@ axis @-@ correction is slightly limited because of a color @-@ lift with 8 @-@ bit per color . so , if you can perform too far from the original image , areas with over@@ load mode can occur . if you can perform the white axis in the raw mode , which in 16 @-@ bit mode works , so your ways to correction is better .
this tool is based on a tin@@ al cut@@ over of copyright protected by Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . you start it via the menu @-@ application colors white ab@@ iden@@ tically to the image processing .
the showcase can be adjusted in size . on the left you can see both the original image as well as the preview of the target image . the preview is dynam@@ ically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original screen immediately , it &apos;s enough to click the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this mark@@ er is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ o@@ gram .
right above , a hist@@ o@@ gram appears that dynam@@ ically modified as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ o@@ gram is very helpful because , even in well illuminated images , most pixels with very small L@@ umin@@ escence . with a button you can decide whether any of the three colours or your sum is displayed .
the contrast of your outcome depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or di@@ mming you too .
the stat has to play with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and afterwards somewhere to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the whit@@ eboard . in this way the temperature and green values are automatically set .
additionally you can set the whit@@ eboard with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available :
the trans@@ lu@@ sion indic@@ ator increases the colors , if more than a color channel of the pix@@ els is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result in the white axis . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons Save as and shop makes exactly this . each attitude of the white balance you have set allows you to save in a text file and load later again .
the button pres@@ ets puts all the filter values again on their default values and the associated image blade . please note that another photo will be displayed as your original . if you save these neutral settings , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust here the codes of the be@@ processed image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widespread JP@@ EG format , 16 @-@ bit enco@@ ding is better for high @-@ quality images . this coding requires also more disk space , calcul@@ ating time and is on@@ ly@@ on@@ ly@@ on@@ for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and DN@@ G .
this tool opens the same dialogue as the processing of color pictures . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color tone can be performed by the sub@@ window for the lumin@@ aires . a detailed instructions for the use of color profiles can draw the chapter Color Management Rate .
another important tool can be found in the menu at colors Ton@@ . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time . this is useful when your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and therefore always need the same correction . in the manual for key last@@ y you will find more information .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you will find under colours gra@@ dation in the menu .
the digi@@ tization ; tool colour effects provides you four colour effects , a solar effect effect , a ne@@ on filter , a ne@@ on effect and a c@@ utter filter .
in times of chemical processing , solar de@@ generation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect was created when one completed a partly developed pressure a short flash light and then inver@@ ted the image of the picture . the result was a partial neg@@ atively of the picture . this tool allows you to fin@@ alize this interesting effect fine .
the intensity control the solar system . at about 50 % intensity , the image shows what chem@@ ically possible . another raise is finally generated a negative image , that such as not to produce photo paper .
this is an example of solar effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation effect that it makes a stronger contra@@ sting effect that makes the colours brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simple , it em@@ bell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for one of day@@ light @-@ converted paint movie which is produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors during day@@ light and high contrasts . however , Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated color but also some photographs , especially those which are barely re@@ conditioned , too much .
the ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates Ne@@ on@@ licht against the contradiction . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ pping re@@ ps the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . in large images the filter can sp@@ elled the whole CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to correct the color contra@@ sting and the lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can for experimenting with the different color leaf@@ lets of your photos in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the results you use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you can get a photo in bad light conditions , you can get the opposite problem : one too big satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / sati@@ ation will be a good choice for sati@@ ety instead of increasing it . if you can perform the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool of gravity and the simple leu@@ ch@@ force / contrast / Gamma is the tool Ton@@ ef@@ correct to improve the exposure . even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated , you need for the use of the Sch@@ late . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ o@@ gram .
the window contains a graph of the intensity values , an hist@@ o@@ gram , the active edge or the selected area . under the graphs are three sli@@ der into it and that can be shifted to change the intensi@@ fication of the picture . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright side areas .
the easiest way to learn how to handle is to move the regul@@ ator and take care of how the image changes .
on the right hand , the original and preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview is dynamic , with the settings of the image , updated . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set whether the hist@@ o@@ gram is shown with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y @-@ axis . for pictures of a digital camera is often the linear display of a constant color . in pictures the large areas of a constant color is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is more useful .
three controllers : the top one for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for medium tones , often called gam@@ ers .
the three color@@ ings can be used in the preview of the original image , in order to automatically detect the input , middle and bright notes . moreover , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
exec@@ uting : the exec@@ uting provide the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to modify the out@@ lining as well as in the input data . for example , the compression of the output can be used to create a hidden picture as a background , while something else is in the foreground .
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the picture .
save and load : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and re @-@ loaded it later . this will be used to Gimp some format .
if you use this mode and the three colours boxes , the input buttons is automatically re@@ group@@ ed for all shadows , resources and solar panel . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the serial application for red , green@@ - , blue and lumin@@ aires .
the Sur@@ render indi@@ k@@ ator option controls all color channels to view over @-@ coated pixels and display you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , that is , you only get the effect in the preview and it &apos;s no effect at the final result .
below you can see an example of the adju@@ sting of the serial insert applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the exec@@ utable are unchanged . the original image is marked ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand side is displayed half of the original and the target image . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated according to your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
Modi@@ fying channel : this selection box allows the channel to specify the channel that is changed by the module :
in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures that were included with a digital camera , linear mode is the most use@@ able mode . for pictures with large areas of a constant color , linear mode generates a wide couch . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps .
if you move for example a te@@ vent@@ eil to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright sounds are corresponding with darker sp@@ ears and the image of image is darker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red mark@@ er . if you want to change this mark@@ er in the area you want to change , an appropriate line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is j@@ us@@ hed to your taste .
save and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve that can be created can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and can be loaded later . the file format is the Gimp cam format .
if you create this method and the three colours buttons , you automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , middle and sunny . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click the original image to set the check@@ points for the red , green@@ - , blue and lumin@@ aire curve .
the Over@@ looking In@@ spec@@ ulator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ loaded pixels , you get the combined effect . on this occasion , it is an indicator , that is , you only get the effect in the preview and it &apos;s no effect at the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ canal . shadow and sun@@ flower was applied with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the correc@@ te@@ d. ( 2 ) .
the channel @-@ mix@@ er of the digi@@ tization came ; image editing is a tool in order to improve the color channels or change the shades of the photos .
the channel mix@@ er is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of the pictures . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mix@@ er of the image processing .
with the can@@ al@@ op@@ box you can select the color for the hist@@ o@@ gram : this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channel by viewing the relative distribution and swing . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be seen as compared to its own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the picture , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ o@@ gram to show you the corresponding color .
the controls for the module are on the right bottom : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to mix these can@@ als . if you can also activate the corresponding color components , since the channel bl@@ ender then DAS tools for generating great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try the green canal for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially if you mix Mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , the reduction of a color will appear to be a visible smo@@ ker that doesn &apos;t appear on the same spot in the color canal and their smoking pattern in each channel otherwise looks different . if that &apos;s the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ me conversion in which you reduce the bre@@ wers first .
saving buttons and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mix@@ er settings can be saved for later and then load . the used file format is the Gimp channel mix@@ er format .
the Sur@@ render indi@@ k@@ ator option controls all color channels to view over @-@ coated pixels and display you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , that is , you only get the effect in the preview and it &apos;s no effect at the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue Canal is re@@ printed . the L@@ umin@@ ator option is to be activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the painted image below ( 2 ) .
black / white @-@ photography has always been fascinating because of your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a working step where color pictures can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film @-@ roll@@ ers .

green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film @-@ load with a green l@@ om@@ filter . this looks good at all the scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . thus , similar to the 00@@ 4 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange fil@@ ter : sim@@ ulated a black / white film load with a unique ruler filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air sn@@ aps . therefore , similar to the 00@@ 2 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) orange op@@ ter .
rot@@ filters : sim@@ ulates a black / white film @-@ load with a red lime @-@ filter . this creates dramatic follow @-@ effects and can sim@@ ulate the moon @-@ effects of the day time . therefore , similar to the 00@@ 3 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film load , with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural shade correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ ph@@ aton : creates warm bright and medium tones , while having added a little cold in the womb . this is very similar to the process of getting a printing and re @-@ development in an epi@@ blast . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to 00@@ 5 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the digi@@ tization ; tool texture can apply to decorative textures on one image .
by adding a texture to your image , no matter whether it is a color@@ full or not , you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop kind portrait shot from enlarged points or how a m@@ ural on a wall . the menu image editing image paste can be used for it .
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the semb@@ lance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper text effect has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the altered under ( 2 ) . the parameters Rel@@ ief has been set to 200 .
for digi@@ tization ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of an observer in the limits of a photo is no easy task . an opportunity to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the cont@@ end eye . under picture frame can be started the module can be started from image processing .
type : with this parameter , you make the desired type of cream for your image . thoroughly fenced with a thin line and a wide framework ( ideal for black @-@ white images ) , abbrevi@@ ated it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal is for a push @-@ fe@@ ather and decorative add a ornam@@ ental frame with patterns .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value area for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
this will be larger when the frame painting is bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the print of images , especially if you have used the tool by aspect ratio .
with this handy tool , you can insert single @-@ format@@ ted text into a picture of any location . this also goes to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it using the mouse . use text size , orientation , color from the color size and the character set . the larger the image , the larger must be the character set . at the end you simply choose a frame round the text and / or a half @-@ sighted background . already the picture is finished .
any setting that you choose for your text may be changed until you hit the button &apos; OK &apos; . once the picture has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the digi@@ template ; tool template cannot apply a template for an image .
the Con@@ template &apos;s menu image in image processing can be used to lay sten@@ cils on a picture .
for the sten@@ cil , there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , you need to take the P@@ NG file format and should add with maximum compres@@ sing ( 9 ) to the reduction of file size . if you want to add your sten@@ cil template ; add @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ pack ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ came @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you have to put your template folder with the button base folder in dialog . select the folder in which you copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the sten@@ cils , a tree @-@ view that reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil . the selection of a folder is automatically updated the thumb@@ sp@@ out of the sten@@ cils automatically .
under the preview , there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button is enlarged the image below . it is cent@@ red around the position of the mouse . check it with the right mouse button .
shr@@ unken : this button res@@ ized the underlying image below . if you want to apply the template on the entire image , you must reduce the picture accordingly . check it with the right mouse button .
move : use this button to move the picture below the template . take the image and place it at the desired location .
use OK if you want to apply the template on your image . the image will then be automatically adjusted to the thumb@@ nail .
digi@@ tization came ; provides three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ alties . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharp@@ ens is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but created especially in dark areas , gra@@ ined pictures .
shar@@ per mask is working at the contrast of the edges of the edges . actually , it doesn &apos;t get a bit , it works rather psych@@ o @-@ visual . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it is doing a really good job . the algorithm was taken out of Gimp and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
re@@ focus is perhaps the best of the three since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
photos without focus as well as most of the digi@@ tised images need a correction of sharp@@ ness . elements that are smaller than the resolution will therefore be watching a little bl@@ ur . the same phenomenon can be watching when coloring points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras usually require more subsequently to act as normal cameras for private use .
with JP@@ EG images frequently a camera has been used internally . images of the raw @-@ format , on the other hand , must always be gri@@ lled during processing .
some scanner support a sharp@@ ness filter during the reading of the picture . if you disable these disable , you will get control over your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by using a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing base . you can sharp@@ ens with the check@@ box in the course of the menu .
you should be careful about this , as the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also rein@@ forcing the noise . in general , the most useful technique to sharp@@ ly focus on one image is the tool re@@ focus . in general , you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharp@@ ness .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ acking . the solution , the image is a little soft to draw . use the tool to draw sof@@ tened with the menu entry ) and experiment with settings . the thumb@@ nail on the right side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo .
the filter blur@@ red bl@@ ur is a very good tool to remove vei@@ ls from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview help you edit the image . the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two major parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often create good results and should initially be tried out . an increase in the radius or the amount enhance the effect . if you make the sharp@@ ness mask too strong , they will create noises and the impression of gr@@ ats near sharp edges .
the radius puts a how many pixels on each side of a channel are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radio . you should therefore find pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ ring picture that is being added to the original . thus , the strength of the ac@@ ut@@ eness is set .
the corpor@@ a value is a fraction of the maximum R@@ GB value and the difference difference . one can thus define a minimal difference in order for a channel of the filter . thus , areas with a soft switch between the sounds are exemp@@ t from the blur@@ red and therefore beauty error in faces , Himm@@ ling and water surfaces .
this is an example of the bl@@ ur masculine filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the painted image ( 2 ) . blur@@ red image has been applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a corpor@@ a = 0.@@ 0 .
the digi@@ tization : tool Re@@ focus is focused on an image by enhancing the depth of the field . it used to be used to protect the protected design of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to und@@ o an image &amp; quot ; re@@ focused approach ; this is a better approach than just trying to sharp@@ ens the photo . re@@ focus mostly better results than bl@@ ur . re@@ focus mostly gains better results than bl@@ ur . you can start it from the menu by calling colors Re@@ focus in image processing .
in practice the circular F@@ altung works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung has a very long tail , which leads that the mathematical result also depends on the source pixel , which is far from the original pixel &apos;s F@@ altung . in most cases , the Gau@@ ß Wiener in@@ verse the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ schen F@@ altung is adver@@ sely affected by the distant pixel . the resulting unwanted results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most pictures , the default value should set a good results . you can put a higher value when your image is very blur@@ red , but then pay attention to hal@@ ts .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the value close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of the module .
noise filters : an increase in the smo@@ ker can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0,@@ 1 rarely get useful . if the smo@@ ker filter is too low , &amp; win ; 0 is the image quality very bad . a useful value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will add the picture further .
Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos; s edge . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a value in@@ equal zero , you might also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transform@@ ative atri@@ x . an increase in the matrix size can create good results , especially if you select great values for the circular shar@@ pen@@ ing or the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ schen sharp@@ ness . however , note that the module is very slow if you choose large values for that parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the storing and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focus parameters that you have set will be stored for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all the cuts , color and Inten@@ si@@ fications on the picture before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that lots of operations changes that are not immediately visible , but leave later in@@ convenient arti@@ facts .
if you are reading images and comp@@ ress , &amp; eg . as JP@@ EG , you should apply the module to un@@ compressed image .
generally , irregular Mas@@ k@@ ate produces better results than sharp@@ ens . this could be caused by blur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighbourhood rather than sharp@@ ness .
theoretically , the blur@@ red mas@@ king has to create increasingly ar@@ te@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of the sharp@@ ly filter . at least , the result of the F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ ters is always as good as the sharp@@ ness mask . the F@@ IR Vienna filter is often better in handling small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small un@@ focused picture :
the original un@@ sharp color @-@ screen must be corrected . this picture was taken with an an@@ alog@@ ous camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light to the car focus lens .
for more information on the methods for sharp@@ ness and correction in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the regul@@ ator glasses dra@@ gons uses the sharp@@ ness of the area of the spo@@ ilt area , in order to create a more natural P@@ up@@ ille .
the colour tin@@ ction allows a adapted color for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust it here .
the tool inf@@ alli@@ ble is one of the most highly developed tool to paint not desired arti@@ facts with an unprecedented speed .
the In@@ ki@@ algorithm has been developed by the IMA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS lab@@ s in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various settings as a starting points to simplify the restoration . the available settings are considered below :
if you want to set the filtering settings in a j@@ us@@ hing , you can use the rider smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
deta@@ illed post@@ ure &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to a uniform smoo@@ thing on the picture . whereas greater values mainly homo@@ geneous regions gl@@ a@@ ts and details are sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should receive details so that no sharp@@ ness is necessary . please note that the detail of detail should always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated .
direction Dep@@ u@@ den@@ cy Alpha &#91; 0.@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes in all directions , while keeping a value close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film @-@ body or C@@ CD Rau@@ schen will produce a high value of wave @-@ like patterns . JP@@ EG arti@@ facts are best viewed with a value close to 1 .
smooth set@@ tes &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum gra@@ dient factor above all else@@ . p then define the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore , set this value suitable to the degree of smoking in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter also affects larger structures . the higher the value is set , the more it is smoo@@ ther , since it is difficult to determine the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm has been going through . usually this is enough 1 or 2 .
Win@@ kel@@ gradual entry &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ y Alpha . if Alpha is chosen , it should be small as well . so take care that small angles can produce a long term . thus , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to suit your needs .
inclusive s@@ step &#91; 0,@@ 1 , 10 &#93; : inclusive down@@ grade in pixel . you should use the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing , and never exceed 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation : the More quality that you get through the choice of this option is only low . however , it doubles its running time . therefore , we recommend it to it .
the buttons Save as and shop makes exactly this . every setting of image errors can be saved into a text file and re @-@ loaded it later .
image errors correct is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still take very long and a high CPU load gradually pull . you can therefore break the calculation with the button disman@@ tling at any time .
below you can see how to remove pictures with little arti@@ facts . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an an@@ alogue camera . as you see there is a peculiar black arti@@ fact in the foreground , that caused by a bad filming during the trip . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ tization came ; sound reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce tile noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
this tool presents your sel@@ ectable image filter to remove spots and other arti@@ facts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it may also be used to remove sensory cable from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ vor@@ ute ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information on sensory cameras from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the scre@@ enshot shows a typical scene which has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a liqu@@ or that can be successfully removed with this tool .
the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window Advanced settings can remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixels and can blur@@ red the image . the area indicated by the radius is moving over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thes and thus cleared up smaller mistakes .
sharp@@ ness : insp@@ ect the edge of the filter at the front . this value sets the pix@@ el@@ ab@@ re@@ ast to the front . if it will increase the edges of the filter while you change this adjustment . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter images can no longer be obtained and noises can be found again .
edges : controlling the edge @-@ accuracy for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it can be too strong , not the entire noise can be removed or rough tips can occur . put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a watch@@ ful noise or JP@@ EG arti@@ facts without losing any details .
lumin@@ ance : controlled the lumin@@ osity of the image . we recommend either colour or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not affect the sample process that is controlled by the details -@@ settings .
color : controlled the color @-@ eye of the picture . we recommend either colour or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not affect the sample process that is controlled by the details -@@ settings .
Gamma : controls the Gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ anz of the picture . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which typically be stronger , however there is also the shadow areas .
absorption : controls the adju@@ sting of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ iness . this figure defines how fast the adap@@ tive filtering radius is responded to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated the edges are smoo@@ ther if it can occur on its minimum , smoking and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter can occur in edges . it can remove cas@@ c@@ tips and is the recommended method for it .
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for the noise reduction you have set , can be stored into the fil@@ esystem and will be loaded later .
this is an example of how smoking reductions can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the correc@@ te@@ d. with ( 2 ) . the lo@@ id reduction was used with default settings .
sometimes a picture is cr@@ acking for your purpose . however , the solution to drawing the picture a little soft , is fortunately much easier than an image . use this tool to draw sof@@ tened with the menu item , and experiment with the glasses . the template window on the right side of the dialogue shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the digi@@ tization came ; photo Rest@@ oration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to decrease photo ar@@ te@@ facts .
this filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of undes@@ irable arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to show Gau@@ ck &apos;s sound , film @-@ grain and local errors that appear in digital , original or subsequently digi@@ tised images . the smoo@@ thing happens along the image outlines and thus receives the content as it also makes the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and text composition . the translation process is done with another tool , the brightness correction , has been developed by the IMA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS lab@@ s in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ s and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JP@@ EG arti@@ facts reduce that the compression of JP@@ EG is not perfect , in some areas a very far away from it . as a loss of compres@@ sing com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ism he generates some compression &amp; quot ; ar@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards which are shown in un@@ zi@@ pped image . this attitude meant to correct these problems .
the buttons Save as and shop makes exactly this . each setting of photo @-@ restoration can be saved into a text file and re @-@ loaded later .
photo @-@ restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still take very long and a high CPU load gradually pull . you can therefore ab@@ ort the calculation with the button anytime .
below you can see how a photo with like @-@ shaped noise will be restored .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera recorded on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 Film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film @-@ grain on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time textures was applied to an old color photo created using a scanner . you can see the scan ar@@ te@@ facts caused by sc@@ anning lights and the photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ track ; tool Hot@@ pixel permits Hot@@ pixel of photos showing a C@@ CD camera gem , eight were to be removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project , protected by Martin Dick@@ lop .
bright , pu@@ zz@@ ling or hot pixels are particularly high @-@ quality raw mode photos an issue since many cameras with JP@@ EG compression over a built @-@ in repression for hot pixels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pix@@ el@@ quot ; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bright pixel quot ; in a photo with a dark @-@ image sub@@ traction method . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
download this file in the wizard with the button dark . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture preview .
when you have an old digital camera , it &apos;s important to record the dark picture directly in connection with new hot or bright pixels through c@@ drom defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the fitting dark picture to the correct image . note the automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . please note that the wizard notice the last dark image and re@@ charge it automatically in the next session .
the image area and the preview help you correct the result within the picture . the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are taken up in all anticip@@ ations .
choose an area to see the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and results of the movie . then select the best filter method to cross these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ ing : it is procu@@ ced an average of the neighbor pixel . the resulting color is assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional Inter@@ pol@@ ation this will be separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear . all pixels that have a distance from 1 to the pix@@ el@@ block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
square : this is the default movie method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pix@@ el@@ block are pulled to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
Cub@@ an : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are deduc@@ ted to calculate a bi @-@ cub@@ an surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cub@@ an curves ( 1 dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction to a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long ir@@ radiation , applied . the original image was magni@@ fied to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ tization came ; Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ erungs@@ last@@ y is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. sub@@ commands , an image .
mo@@ ck@@ wise lenses , especially the middle and large photo format , can often not ev@@ enly illuminated the whole sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( shady ) they reduce the corners and edges of the picture by using the light that reaches the sensor there . Tele@@ lenses show some circumstances also this behavior .
it also has disadvantages . many Center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 in aper@@ ture filter , which makes it impossible to keep the camera with the hand . for@@ ged @-@ angle lenses , also with Center filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller because otherwise un@@ due effects emerge .
with the great ins@@ cription of today &apos;s film and color scanner or gra@@ ars of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a c@@ enter@@ filter by transforming a equi@@ val@@ ent transformation to a raw filter that is applied without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correc@@ tive the transformation with a c@@ enter@@ filter on a picture . the algorithm has copyright protected by John Walker .
with three controllers you can control the vig@@ net@@ ting filter and control the image of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light output damp@@ er at the point of the largest density . the standard density is 2,@@ 0 , which is an optical filter with a aper@@ ture set of 1 , or random@@ ly a lumin@@ osity of 2 , escaped . increase the density by a bigger degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree .
lumin@@ osity , contrast and Gamma Kni@@ fe : the editing of an image with the vig@@ net@@ ti@@ erungs@@ id reduces the lumin@@ osity of the target image with these options new j@@ us@@ . the controller supply you only positive values , as you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er adju@@ sting of the aim of the target image , let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma for zero and use the dation from the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ting correction to one image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the correct image ( 1 ) the corrected image . a lumin@@ ance and counter@@ balance was also carried out in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; Lin@@ sen@@ distor@@ tion is a tool to correct the effect of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geom@@ etric distor@@ tions . coloured distor@@ tions can not be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second indicator covers the general geom@@ etric distor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conc@@ ise form of the image .
the co@@ efficient of the third gra@@ dient has a similar circuit effect , fla@@ p at edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the co@@ efficient fourth Gra@@ des corrected the remote sites to that of the second Gra@@ des . when you combine these two , each geom@@ etric distor@@ tion can be almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion second gra@@ des . with negative values , t@@ len@@ tic@@ ular distor@@ tions can be corrected , and positive values of the ho@@ ver@@ ous distor@@ tion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion fourth Gra@@ des . this value works stronger at the edges and in the middle of the picture . for most lenses the &apos; corners parameter has gener@@ alized the opposite sign of the parameter .
z@@ oom : this value scale the image size and thus leads to a correction first gra@@ dient . negative values enlarge while positive the image reduced .
brigh@@ ten up : this value indicates the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values reduce the brightness of the picture in the corners , while positive values they increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , the di@@ alogs with a preview the version correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used when default values .
the t@@ onal or ho@@ ver@@ shaped correction should be done before all the cuts or size changes . at best , you run this correction as all the first . if you want to re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a ton@@ ical correction , the effect would be apparent .
to help you find the best correction , this tool presents a vertical and horizontal relief line . move it into an important place , such as the sea side or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the ton@@ n@@ - / ho@@ ver@@ shaped stop using the help of the lines .
if you correct a ho@@ ver@@ shaped g@@ out , the resulting image is black corners . you can remove them with the cutting @-@ tool in the menu transformations , remove from image processing or on the z@@ oom controller of this dialogue .
for most pictures the ton@@ sil@@ ky correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some motives as e.g. recordings from the front , frames and paintings is it the perspective so correct the all angle in picture 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of perspective .
this is an example of a t@@ onal correction is applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for sim@@ ulate infrar@@ ed movie the G@@ imp@@ et@@ o.@@ org web page which is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrar@@ ed movie , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rec@@ tan@@ gle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview , you can set two parameters adapting the gran@@ ulation and cinem@@ at@@ ability ( ISO ) . add the option of a movie gran@@ ul@@ arity if you want to sim@@ ulate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive movie . the ISO @-@ controller changes the quantity of film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter colors to reproduce by infrar@@ ed film , especially the green canal makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white @-@ photos as the color formations are missing .
this is an example of an infrar@@ ed sound effect applied to a landscap@@ ing photo from New Zealand . the original image is placed under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . higher ISO values produce a type of au@@ ra in the sh@@ utter .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; Fil@@ ming Film@@ ation is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film @-@ grain images , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , known to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers of large silver @-@ gra@@ ins of the photo em@@ ul@@ sion .
the film @-@ grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to get back into the past . if you want to use this specific , gallery @-@ like , se@@ photographer , gran@@ ular sight specially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ men photos , you must use these filters .
with the controller , the ISO @-@ sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to the control of the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the gra@@ ins . the default value is , although frequent higher values are needed to be adjusted to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more Kör@@ ner , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of film construction effect on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and I used the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ age came ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses the copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ age came ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature images and still@@ s are good for this effect .
there are two controllers to influence this effect . the top select the brush size between one and five out . thicker brus@@ hes are better suited for big pictures . smooth control controls the glasses or , from the other side , considers the sing@@ ul@@ arity .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the edited is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smoo@@ thing 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ tor came ; filter coal @-@ drawing uses color and power gra@@ dient , the lines that define the outlines in the drawing are highlighted . pictures of their gra@@ dients are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to outline you . this would be good pictures to start with .
there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper one chooses the foundation size and the lower j@@ us@@ hes the contrast ( glasses ) .
this is an example of the coher@@ ence filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the altered picture ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result may be improved by adaptation of the Inten@@ sity .
the digi@@ code draws ; filter Gra@@ vity dominates your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it has been thrown up in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the digi@@ code draws ; filters engra@@ ving is a fast tool to give your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . he works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important of the content . the filter uses the differences between colour and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ ary landscape .
the depth permits the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default .
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filtering . the original ( 1 ) and the painted image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of distor@@ tion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
shaft blocks 1 : divide the image in cells and lets it look as if it is seen through glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : similarly to the wave blocks , the image is distor@@ ted here in a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate high CPU load . you can ab@@ ort these effects at any time with the button push .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo in an artwork by means of blur@@ redness effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
z@@ oom Un@@ shar@@ per : wi@@ pes the image along stone @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ating from a center . this sim@@ ulates the im@@ shar@@ per a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often in the sport photography .
radi@@ ale En@@ sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image by rotation of the pixels around a center . this sim@@ ulates the blur@@ redness of a three @-@ spinning camera .
removal of removal : blur@@ red the image around the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to step back in the background .
motion sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the blur@@ redness of a linear motion , z : B : out of a car or train photograph , camera .
soft tip : blur@@ red the image soft in the dark and strong in bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or to add a warm and subtle fi@@ ddle .
contrac@@ ep@@ tive : blur@@ red the image by random shift of the pixels and sim@@ ulates the blur@@ red one of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent Indi@@ c@@ ency : finds the d@@ arbe@@ et in the picture and blur@@ red it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it , by feeding with an average pix@@ el@@ ength , new .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel it at any time with the button push .
the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es are a nice little tool to make brack@@ ets on your picture . this gives it natural your pictures a hot look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected algorithm .
dri@@ pping size allows to change the size of the drop . since the dro@@ plet size does not grow automatically with the size of the picture , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and the density of the sperm . fish change the optical effect of drops on the picture .
you can use the digi@@ tization ; image editing a area free from rain drops . use the choice of tools to choose the area , for example a face that shall be free to select . if you start afterwards the filter for rain drops , the area will remain free of reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es .
this is an example of the rain drops . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the painted image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirror or turning into the right orientation . you can find the tools in the menu transformation or transformation .
photo infl@@ ated is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
to reduce an image is simple . the big question is how can you infl@@ ate an image and sharp@@ ness the details ? how can you invent the missing information again ? how can you invent the missing information or gu@@ essed ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here is a good work . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can change it to the desired size with the tool size . choose your transforming size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below .
the tool to size change a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method in order to move the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image processing programs use kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ tization also developed by IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS lab@@ s in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab new size and are considered below :
aspect ratio : if this setting is activated , when entering the new size the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter also affects larger structures . the higher the value is set , the more it is smoo@@ ther , since it is difficult to determine the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s &apos; turbul@@ ence effect he must be t@@ aller than 3 .
the buttons Save as and store are used exactly for this purpose . it can be saved as a text file and then re @-@ loaded it later .
photo infl@@ atable is very fast with what it makes , but it can still take very long and a high CPU load for itself . you can ab@@ ort the calculation with the button at any time .
you can see below an example for photo sho@@ ots by adding a little color to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the thumb@@ nails ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enhancement to the comparison .
to cut a photo is not only a frequent operation , but also a frequently underestimated tool to compile a picture . image processing allows you to simply cut the rec@@ tan@@ gle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and draw the ch@@ equ@@ es . you will then see this rec@@ tan@@ gle during you move the mouse .
once you start the button down , the area of the photo will be cut off . this gives you a good overview how your photo will look after the cutting area . you can change the size of the area to cut the area by clicking on the corners of the rectangular area . create a new rec@@ tan@@ gle by simply drag it up with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cli@@ pping , use the Tool@@ bar button in the tool@@ bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file File save or file Save as in the File menu to save the newly @-@ cut photo .
in the thumb@@ area , you can change the size of the rectangular area by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio , which you have defined in dialogue remains intact .
in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high @-@ format , the larger value of height and the width is always assigned to the width .
the tool After si@@ licate ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . that means that it is always the same , regardless of whether you use cen@@ tim@@ etres , ink or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialogue exist two buttons to switch the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or vertically .
below in a dialogue , you can use the Max . ratio to the access to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen relation and orientation , put it .
the tool After page rati@@ os saves its settings depending on the orientation ( Horiz@@ ontal or Ver@@ tical module ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on the orientation . the modified dimensions are reflected in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data re@@ mirror the image to the image and not the original image .
the settings of the co @-@ operation helps provide help , so that you can put your pictures better together . these help include :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic parts are based on the principle of similarity . as the third party rule , harmon@@ ic triangles are a possibility to share a rec@@ tan@@ gle in a similar harmon@@ ic triangle with the di@@ ag@@ onal triangle .
Golden middle : the golden middle is a division of on various natural growth pattern as e.g. the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us pussy or the bl@@ aming leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things on which we feel as beautiful .
the golden partition is the ir@@ rational number 1.@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was already used with the ancient Egyptians and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects together used the Golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . from where every number is equal to the sum of its two previous numbers . the app@@ ending part is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that is followed by this rule is considered visually harmon@@ i@@ ously .
the golden middle represents liquid relief lines if you put an image assembled . these aids are enumer@@ ated below :
the Golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos . compared to third party , the Golden spiral creates a liquid form that can follow the eye through the picture . this type of composition brings the spect@@ ator &apos;s view along the line of the spiral and creates a symm@@ etrical son@@ ic river on this type .
another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gle of the golden spiral , also called Golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . it should give something that the eye is placed in the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . this something can be simply because without the eye , it will fulfil its task .
the Golden Tri@@ angle also deri@@ ve from the above discussed golden Spir@@ al . its ver@@ tex points are the mid@@ points of the pages of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , Golden triangles are not the same triangles . di@@ ag@@ onal to place these lines can be a static object dynamic .
when you use Golden triangles to break your frame and create a effect of professional photo ograph@@ s dynamic Sy@@ mm@@ etry . try your photo@@ focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach any other way .
the options horizon flip and flip @-@ mirror can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic parts .
with the button color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rot@@ ate an image around any angle .
if you make a photo , then it happens easily that the camera is not exactly vertical or horizontal . this creates a picture in which things turned around a corner . you can repair this with the digi@@ tization ; image processing and tool free rotation . select your trans@@ cription Free rotation and adjust the target angle .
rot@@ ate your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are indicated in degrees . with the button pres@@ ets you can set the sli@@ der back to 0 degree . a preview of the turn is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right .
for your help , the module Free Rot@@ ation provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the picture preview to position the two lines . after you fix it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now , adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you turned out a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair is it &apos;s the function transformations to exploit from image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the function Autom@@ atically t@@ cutting . choose one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing option does the picture a bit after rotation . however please note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ ical transformations are carried out around a fix@@ ation point in the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your picture . the preview is then automatically re@@ charged . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas that originated through the transformation are into pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas that originated through the transformation are into pixels .
angle on the top : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left of the transformed area .
angle on the top : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right of the transformed area .
angle on the left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adju@@ sting the perspective , the picture becomes a little lubric@@ ated . for individual adaptation , this effect is small , but two adjustments create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective you get un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to clean it is the picture with transforming crop cutting from image processing .
the utility tool is used to move a part of the picture into one direction and shift the other part into the opposite . it is no spin , the picture is distor@@ ted . in other words , a rec@@ tan@@ gle becomes transformed into a parall@@ elo@@ gram . you can start this module through transform@@ ers .
sc@@ atter your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can push horizont@@ ally and vertically . if you press preference , the angles will appear on zero . a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown right from the thumb@@ nail .
for your help you &apos;ll get a vertical and horizontal line . move the mouse at an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your screen and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the utility vehicles to adjust your image .
after you performed the shot , the picture gets caught a bit . for a single sh@@ allow@@ er this effect is mostly neg@@ li@@ gible , but two notes are twice as much si@@ blings and therefore you should avoid this .
after dra@@ ining the picture has un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with transform@@ ative list@@ ings from image processing .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write pictures . therefore the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were comp@@ uted . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of machine formats .
due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JP@@ EG and TI@@ FF below it .
&amp; digi@@ came ; shows only files in formats known to the list . if the extension is listed in the list , the file is listed in the image processing . you can change this list of extensions &amp; digi@@ tization . in the configuration you can find more information .
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JP@@ EG or TI@@ FF . some cameras may even choose to select the format used in Wikipedia . for a more detailed description of this file formats , you can find in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ code ; supports both formats .
image compression is the use of data @-@ compression procedures to digital pictures . thereby redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data in a more efficient way .
JP@@ EG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smoo@@ ther results as JP@@ EG at the same compression relationship . the 200@@ 0s can also be stored losses if it is specified in the settings .
if you want to find out more about the raw @-@ screen format , you can read from Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous River and Cambridge in Col@@ our very helpful guides in English . you can convert raw materials pictures in JP@@ EG or TI@@ FF with the raw @-@ model @-@ charging of &amp; digi@@ tization . in the section configuration you will find further information on the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ tization .
&amp; digi@@ entered ; supports loading of raw materials only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which came in &amp; digi@@ tised . all support cameras can be seen below on the Web @-@ page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a brief list of raw formats produced by &amp; digi@@ tization :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are frequently used in AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG @-@ Format . however , it &apos;s not a film editor and has not yet been able to view or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ tised , the &amp; nbsp ; settings to play films to launch the program .

K@@ IP@@ I module exports a series of images to a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Google Google Earth .
if you can switch between 4 and 5 you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good then you can perform the first four adjustment with the module .
many tools you need to require the photo editing process is included in &amp; digi@@ tization . your description follows here .
all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ness , so@@ aking , sound , bl@@ ur , bl@@ ur , bl@@ ur , and etc . use a single di@@ alogues displayed before the filter is applied in a preview , below the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture applicable ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter on the current image . links from him allow five buttons the comparison mode of the preview to change . these modes are :
vertically divide without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area right of the selected preview .
horizontal parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the top area displays the original and the bottom shows the filter applied to the area below the selected template .
vertical . the left area displays the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal . the upper area indicates the original and lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; -@@ style : displays the thumb@@ nails if the mouse is not in a preview , and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons which you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ cutting . the colours used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag these frames with the mouse within the picture and disc@@ ard it in the part of the picture from which you want to preview the preview of the dialogue will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is one help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all set @-@ up from the last use of the module will be noted .
the side@@ bar features displays the essential information on the selected image and is largely explic@@ able . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters for shooting the photo . these data stem from the EX@@ IF data when available .
this rider is an intuitive look @-@ based tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ van . you can press and drag C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse kno@@ b around a square . all pictures inside this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course , this requires your pictures of ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for p@@ alle@@ ts files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and to choose and use colors .
the pal@@ ettes is installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can either be installed for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and un@@ har@@ med colour .
in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed p@@ alle@@ ts or search the files according to files .
the cursor is shown in the p@@ allet view as a line . it can be moved by shortened to the area adjacent to a color .
it points to the color of it . the color is described beneath the p@@ alle@@ tising view . here also the color name can be changed .
it can also be used for pick @-@ up . to generate such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cursor . afterwards , move the mouse with pressing left mouse button .
if the box tab is inserted under the button color , the color will be inserted from the color plate at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode is selected to write . this mode you can set by sending the box below by@@ m C@@ ursor .
a selection that was created as described in the last section , can combine together with the actions of copying , cutting and inser@@ ting .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a new@@ line sign in case a further color follows . if so , three payment values can be inserted in the cli@@ p@@ board , this can be inserted as one color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit .
the colors in the palette and the selection of color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color pi@@ cks on the left .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewers ; is a KDE Programme for the viewing of &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there has been no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alise graphs are specified &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; graphic viewer ; the project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphic interface with all the features of a well integrated &amp; cor@@ k ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a KDE Programme for the viewing of &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ SH@@ e . the &amp; graphic viewer ; graphs showing all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph in &amp; Kate ; the graphs are re@@ comp@@ uted and in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graphs in &amp; Kate ; to open or the graphs in &amp; cold viewer ; in a &amp; Kate ; component to open
load large graphs ( currently there are problems with about 1000 no@@ des and a h@@ ack to portra@@ y more than these no@@ des )
further needed software : &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which requires the &amp; graphic logo ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the presentation of the graphs are predicted .
the main window displays the opening graphs , each in an own sub @-@ window . in the beginning , when you start &amp; c@@ graphi@@ cally , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar only open the icon file and the ( blank ) list Fin@@ ally opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot and files , the main window looks like the bottom of the scre@@ enshot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is bigger than the palette . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
the mouse @-@ wheel is using ( high and down without special ta@@ sts , left and right at pressed &amp; old ; button ) ;
the zo@@ oming is restricted in both directions by the factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file is specified in &amp; c@@ graphi@@ cally , the loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph should be loaded or if you want to change the change . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; can your decision also be noted , so that later it will be done . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item settings , graphi@@ cally ... use , see also .
if you open an graph@@ ite viewer out of an ongoing &amp; graphic inter@@ viewer ; for instance , in a file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; graphic inter@@ viewer / instance , or want to display the lo@@ ad@@ ins in a sub@@ window of the already ongoing instance .
as with the last option you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog .
at the programme start , you can open all the graphs of your last meeting again . again , you can save your choice both as well as change later .
they can also define how the graph will be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely .
when you use multiple sites , you can choose if the parts of the graph , which should be inserted on a page , to this page will be ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out of the parts of the graph .
page preview with one on several pages divided graphs without head@@ line and with another font
the page again allows you to specify the behavior if a file has been changed on the hard disk . you can set a standard behaviour ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or checking the program every time .
the Open gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; c@@ graphi@@ viewer ; specify a graph outside of a current session . you can set a standard behavior for this case ( the graphs in a new window open or specify in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time it will be asked .
the page seating administration gives the possibility to set the behaviour of &amp; c@@ graph@@ ite viewer . you can set a standard behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked at any start afterwards .
the right @-@ click menu , which usually appears on a click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; will open up additional possibilities :
here you can choose among various &amp; graphic techniques . the entries , as described on the web page of &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; are described here :
&amp; dot . algorithm , the standard for targeted graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered depic@@ tions of targeted graph . the algorithm puts the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then try to produce as short edges and as few channel over@@ laps .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; -@@ algorithm is the standard for un@@ used graphs . it produces representations in accordance with the spr@@ ing@@ board . it is used to the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wai @-@ algorithm that is equivalent to statisti@@ cally multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm for un@@ used graphs a spr@@ ing@@ le pattern . it uses the fru@@ ct@@ ose Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ skel@@ eton for the treatment of large and ge@@ al graphs .
the &amp; cir@@ co ; -@@ algorithm adds the k@@ not circular shaped to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
opens a dialog , where you can specify a layout command , which will then be exec@@ uting by a shell , and the comp@@ uted Layout of the graph after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout code ; -@@ algorithms allow specific options , or also to change the graphs with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graphs ( directed or un@@ used ) and addresses the standard algorithm for each type ( dot ; for orient@@ ated , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ used graphs ) .
if this setting is activated , the listing is displayed if this is necessary . otherwise it will not be shown and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
displays the What is the mouse cursor . click with this mouse @-@ cursor on a &amp; GUI ; element to get more help on this element ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the chan@@ gelo@@ g file &apos;s base folder .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graphic techniques . it requires the following programs :
a special institution is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; in the Settings menu you will find more options .
the main window of the icon @-@ editor is divided into five ranges : the main tool@@ bar , the bar tool@@ bar , the bar palette , the .@@ color palette , and the lat@@ tice line where you record the symbol .
creates a new symbol . if the current file has been modified , you are asked if you want to save the changes . then a dialogue window in which you can choose if the symbol of a template is to be created , or if you want to start anew .

the K@@ IP@@ I module images can be read to read new images and save them .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan scan : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures from a scanner that supports the SA@@ NE project or another source like e.g. video streams . so this works you must have K@@ oo@@ ka and SA@@ NE .
if you scan the scan images , a dialog , which allows you to select between all available sources on your computer . choose the source from which you want to pick the picture . you can also set the source source for the next time .
then the K@@ oo@@ ka window will replace , by selecting the default values , in order to select your image accordingly . see the preview of your needs , before you read the picture . the estimated file size will appear to you in the right , bottom corner . you will find more information in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual .
note that the window is completely displayed , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after you have pushed the button sc@@ anning , you must wait until the scan is completed and the window to create the options of the target image appears . you can also remember that the type BM@@ P is not compressed and therefore very large files . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image file .
screen photos can create you after you have selected Im@@ por@@ ters &gt; scre@@ enshot ... selecting a window in which you can set the different Screen photo@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop surface to read a single window under the mouse .
if all your own program window is selected , the recording program will disappear , so you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , you &apos;ll be read , after a short delay , the current visible place . if you have selected the complete desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long scre@@ enshot will be waiting before it starts . if you need to switch to other fields of work , you should select these delay enough to navigate the time there .
once the scre@@ enshot is made , the dialog options of the target image with the already described options .

the module ex@@ porting to Flickr can be used to upload pictures from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time , you will be used by the process of generating a to@@ ken . it is thus quasi for your de@@ jo@@ vice on Flickr . a browser will start to log in on Flickr .
after the successful registration , the module can send photos to Flickr &apos;s website . the following page will be presented after a successful login .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after having pushed to yes , you get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr . this will be shown in the next section .
if the module is started on Flickr for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following Dialog , which displays the current access Per@@ mission , the module is available . currently , the module does not currently support any other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you wish to continue with these per@@ missions .
the button pictures should add once pushed once you have set all the other options . with this button you can select the photos you want . if you press on the O@@ k button , upload photos to Flickr Server .
the keywords field can be filled with a list of words separated by comm@@ a separated list of words . these are added to the picture as tags during the flood .
with the options openings , friends and Fam@@ i you can set the access Per@@ mission to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as a private .
if you choose the option to make the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos are changed prior to the upload in the size . size is taken from the value registered at maximal size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is adjusted so the aspect ratio is constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a Galerie @-@ Server

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of a picture . geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF key@@ word of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools available to images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in sp@@ her@@ ical coordination system , which is used by GPS and Galileo . height , long@@ itude and latitude .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data , you need a GPS track as an XML file on the g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alizing cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu on . the above @-@ looking dialogue then appears . to load a possible correlation above time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains the same time in the same places as the pictures of your camera .
if the file is loaded a automatic correlation carried out the coordinates in red . GPS Sp@@ are data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and hence the camera needs to be changed at the time period . this can be done with the time zone . put your camera time@@ zone here .
the setting for maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera types . if the devi@@ ation is underneath , the data is amal@@ gam@@ ated . the maximum value for that is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data of one place for pictures you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have the right data . if you know that in reality a location in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can put that boundaries and then hit the button cor@@ relate to the inter@@ pol@@ ishing press .
the coordinates are manually set with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same place . because the dialog allows the coordinates of a call to the next , you only need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and placed with the displayed map and enlarge . select the region in the area and enlarge Disp@@ e.@@ Pre@@ drag it again and again through until you &apos;ll be selected manually . the card can be switched between card mode , satellite channels and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang out the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script using the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module photo is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums created as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is UT@@ F @-@ 8 , in order to allow the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab allows all albums to select to choose according to HTML . you &apos;ll need to select these albums only . the albums are not hierarch@@ ical . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly choose a large number of albums . in the area below , the thumb@@ nail will appear and the text that appears in the HTML side will appear .
the tab image defines the general look and layout for each page . this rider is largely explic@@ able . if you then click on a picture there is a new page open in which the picture is displayed . otherwise , the image will appear directly with your standard model , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show displays .
the rider &apos;s album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your related images . choose a folder on which you want to use writing . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ ts , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JP@@ EG file format , the EX@@ IF data of your original pictures are also stored in the new images .
with other color depths , you can change the standard color depth . of course , the variable size also influences the file size . all other settings are explained .
the rider thumb@@ nails will allow you to see some of the settings from the album riders for thumb@@ nails , these are small pictures indicated in the gallery .
a progress window displays the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to break the process .
if the module has created the pages the window will not automatically closed . you can therefore view the programs to determine whether errors are performed during the creation . the web browser will automatically end up in order to preview the preview .
the K@@ IP@@ I ima@@ gery is a very fast and flexible OpenGL @-@ based tool to look at pictures .
the K@@ IP@@ I image concerned allows the Ih@@ msen to view a selection of pictures and to carry out on them basic operations such as rotation , zo@@ oming or de@@ port . the be@@ holder can be used with short be@@ ys and mouse @-@ gest@@ ures . it has been developed for a quick picture display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is shown by default in full @-@ screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JP@@ EG los@@ st@@ free module is a tool to change images without any of your quality .
this module allows for the actions listed below to save pictures in the JP@@ EG format without the usual losses to quality or metadata .
the consequence of the loss @-@ free storage is it the file size rises , as no compres@@ sing of the color formations occurs . this is also used e.g. at the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module digital camera system currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ ver@@ de.@@ . attention : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mailbox @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import @-@ function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the file select dialog with which you want to select the target image , so the picture to which you want to copy the metadata . the data will be copied by clicking the button OK .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere else , but not in any target format . JP@@ EG is supported in writing . please check out ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ fier module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide .
the module MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . between the single images you can insert a base picture . you can also add a audio file in MP@@ 2 or WA@@ V of the slides .
all images will be sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slide . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images taken into the MPEG Di@@ ash@@ ore . then you can start using extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au to start the module .
the images you have selected are then enumer@@ ated under image files in the Portfolio . there you can also change sorting the images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should customize the other settings . the video format can be chosen from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you &apos;re planning to select the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , Sec@@ am or NT@@ SC . PAL is default and probably the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds the one picture is displayed . the speed of the picture is determined by it . a low value creates very sudden , a high against it is very smooth switching .
the background color can be set up next . in doubt you should let them black . the name and the path of the created file you can specify under name of the MPEG file file . keep in doing so the extension mp@@ g .
if you specify a audio file using the name of the audio file , then it will be integrated into the movie . after you &apos;ve adapted all settings to your liking , you can start with the button Ko@@ ding the production of the movie . depending on the speed of your machine , you can now have a coffee and enjoy a coffee if you &apos;re back .
if a note appears that coding or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages to the right below .
the printer resistant allows multiple images to print a piece of paper into standard photo@@ sizes . the combined pictures can also automatically be opened with Gimp . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve you or print a direct expression with the Gimp module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import and convert your images within one of three formats JP@@ EG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original choice from Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it produces the same results as the software of your camera carrier . sometimes you get out with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the RA@@ W file to be converted and launch the module . the R@@ w @-@ image @-@ verter window appears in the mode for a single picture . with the button preview , you can preview the effect of your current settings on the picture .
now you can re@@ use the values to optim@@ ise the converting process . the first option is to use whether the camera settings are used for the tin@@ ting character . the key parameters such as Gamma , brightness and red / blue los@@ ures can be j@@ us@@ hed . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so you can use the contr@@ ap@@ shots . if your camera works in R@@ GB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conver@@ tible results . the file name stays equally and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JP@@ EG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged Image format , TI@@ FF , keeps all the information your image and uses the loss @-@ free LZ@@ W compres@@ sing .
if you are planning to process your pictures frequently or otherwise continue to use it otherwise you should not choose the JP@@ EG format as it only permits a limited number of operations prior to the image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JP@@ EG as storage structure , the metadata that are included in the RA@@ W file are stored in the file JP@@ EG file stored in the EX@@ IF data .
if you have adapted your settings you can start running the conversion button . if you want to break this process again , you can do so .
the batch processing mode allows you to convert various images at once . use this mode if you are sure , for example , by test a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility to automatically over@@ write existing file . this is helpful if this is created in a previous trial . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses convert convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following picture formats are supported :
this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting score , and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can make the picture smaller or enlarge . these include four types of picture change :
proportional ( 1 . ) : normal size modification in a dimension . the width or the height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 . ) : size change in two dimensions . this option remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not proportionate sizes in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is altered during this option .
pressure preparation : preparing the image for the photo pressure . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including back@@ size , size size and background colour , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images to your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images before . further pictures can be drawn from the list of images to be sent there .
after you started the module , the image window will display images selected by you . you can add more images to the image selected by selecting a file @-@ op@@ tionally . for the last selected image , a preview on the right will be shown .
you can also drag images to the picture list and disc@@ ard it to you to add the list of images to be selected .
with the button images remove the selected images from the list of images to be selected .
after you have selected all pictures you can open with the button OK the new message window of your e @-@ mail clients . you only need to add the addresses and the subject area here . the pictures selected by you are attached .
do not make sure to send too many pictures to one time . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations on the size of the aler@@ ting e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails when you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every@@ time until you change it .
select your email clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will need to specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download this here .
after the selection of comments can be added to an attached file , the comments to the images put together in a text file and the mail wor@@ ms .
the P@@ NG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted among the los@@ s@@ free formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JP@@ EG format .
if you select JP@@ EG under images file format and the original files in the JP@@ EG format are , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data are added to the ending images .
when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down so you can view the status messages , in search of errors . however , your e @-@ mail program is automatically started in the end . with the button closing , you can switch this window ? en .
after launching the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions like you want to display your Sli@@ deshow . you can choose between the pictures selected and all images of the album .
the OpenGL bi@@ ases option in the presentation will have a very elegant picture over@@ pass through OpenGL . however , you need to have an appropriate graphics card , as otherwise the di@@ ash@@ ore will be very slow .
the fil@@ en@@ ame option displays that the fil@@ en@@ ame of images displayed in the lower left corner during presentation will be displayed .
the loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop . you can then manually inter@@ rupt it with Es@@ c afterwards .
the option images random@@ ly selected ensures that the images are displayed in random order . so it will not be used in order of images in the album .
under delay between images can be set the temporal distance between the individual images . 1500 mill@@ ise@@ con@@ ds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your machine and the selected tip effect . so you should check this before you show your friends !
there are over a dozen trans@@ gres@@ sions between which you can select . random@@ ly choose a different effect during any transition between images .
during the slide bar you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn it on .
with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide .
at the left side of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date j@@ us@@ cation currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ ver@@ de.@@ . attention : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background is a tool to put an image as a background image for the work@@ piece .
this module is the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as a background for your KDE @-@ worker surface .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can interact with &amp; k@@ ale album ; through this brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see by comparing with the picture , are now available in each group , i.e. in people , places and in group keywords entries .
in the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with comments . in addition , there are entries to look to EX@@ IF based information , look at the folder structure on your hard drive and of course watch the current thumb@@ nail . in the following , each one is described .
when you press the mouse to the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
when you select another person only the images appear on which both persons are shown . by this selection method , you can restrict the number of displayed pictures of a few thousand pictures on a few thousand pictures .
when you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can preview with thumb@@ nails to see the images of your activity .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can save with &amp; k@@ ale album ; however , for each person you can store your own thumb@@ nails , which of course applies to places , keywords , and other categories that you have defined by yourself . see the picture .
to view images in addition to the name , select the button which you want to use for the current category . please note that you can view the view for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can display e.g. icons with images of people and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you have no suitable pictures for your keywords ) .
however , you have to decide which picture to be displayed for each individual person . to do this , you will need to view the image menu , as shown in the picture . now you can select the image for the appropriate person . in the picture window you can adjust the enlar@@ ging factor according to your wishes and selecting what part of the picture will be displayed and adjusted .

with the options in the bottom of the window , you can browse all pictures according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here you will find pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; sal@@ ty album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but prefer to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this hand@@ book :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ adi album ; and take a look at the quick entry , the scre@@ enshot and the performance videos .
start &amp; ay dance album ; and in the first Dialog you start the demo , in case you start &amp; # 82@@ album ; for the first time start , or select the menu item for the menu item in the menu item . after that , some examples will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ nu@@ dge ; try out .
if you prefer to print this hand@@ book , you can find it on the home page of &amp; k@@ bar ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ est album , see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this list can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this list shows you data about the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can show you multiple different time units . each box displays a different unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the list just 10 @-@ minutes .
the tim@@ eline can be used in the following ways : you can change the displayed file thumb@@ view of the database ( if you select a date , the tim@@ eline will always display the current date of the moment displayed in preview images ) if you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button down , and drag the mouse over the lin@@ e@@ al of the tim@@ eline , so the schedules are drawn . if you select a range , you will be displayed in the preview view only images of this time period . you can ab@@ ort the selection by clicking on a beam of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; Tra@@ velo@@ album ; introduces you two options to create HTML web@@ pages with your images . the one is integrated into &amp; k@@ gram@@ ophone ; integrated and the other is available as a module ( see ) . in the following part of the user guide , the integrated version is described in &amp; k@@ ak@@ album ; integrated version which you can call via the HTML file ...
before HTML pages are created you will need to make some settings . these are divided into the three ranges of content , layout and target . in the following , each area will be more precise .
first enter the title of the watch and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on no@@ un@@ pages album , HTML @-@ example pages see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; B &amp; B file should be created ; export file should be seen on the review page . nutritional information about export files can be found in .
finally , you can select which information will be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed on the viewer . for example , that all pictures are from a party . you can not use this setting for this option to hide specific pictures from certain deeds .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are clear , which is why they are not addressed specifically .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . thus , those who watch your website and own a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images download , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time . so he can search your pictures with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission system . if he wants to see a picture bigger he changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , you place the different folder and the URL where your website is stored .
select a base folder for all of your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for any subsequent sentence .
first , you need to select the root folder in which all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically set up the next time . thus , you can select either a folder or a KDE supported protocol for all future pictures , for example :
once you have created your pictures , you can check if they really are all visible to viewers . if you want to select a URL for the base folder , after the pages have been created , the URL you specify here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created you are not yet in the final target folder you need to manually copy it manually . so that the import function , see , properly works you must specify the final target of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are .
the currently described setting options are based on all three basic folders and URLs , where there is a sub@@ folder , whose name you specify in output folders .
if you are looking for a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ day@@ s. together , you might want to write your pictures with them . however , if you &apos;ve already got a lot of time for it , the images , persons appearing on the pictures , recep@@ tions , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; nbsp ; this work doesn &apos;t even have to do .
with &amp; nbsp ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ in file . these can import others into your database . the total properties are imported using ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ in files , internal and external . they differ in it whether the images are stored on the file , or if the file is only stored in the file , that you have all images in the file and that file can pass on so independently . however , the obvious drawback is the file size .
you can file a .@@ k@@ in file directly from the File Format ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file along with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ in file .
an external .@@ k@@ in file looks for the images in two times . first , the images are not found , so the images are displayed in the folder of the .@@ k@@ in file . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ in file using HTML @-@ Export .
in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can call via the menu File Ex@@ porting .
the main options of this dialogue is whether it is for internal or external .@@ k@@ in files , as the following three choices are available :
in the manual , to copy the .@@ k@@ in file , you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ in file .
with the option Autom@@ atically in the vicinity of the .@@ k@@ in file , copy and k@@ ale album ; the images are automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures already compressed to JP@@ EG and the XML file itself is very small , it normally does not comp@@ ress the files to comp@@ ress . if you want this , just select the option export file compressed .
the last option of this page is to limit maximum size . if you want to send your friends pictures , you may not want to send the pictures in full size , as the .@@ k@@ in file is otherwise very big . here you can limit the size by example to say that each picture is up to 800 pixels high and wide .
when you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu File Im@@ ported ... selecting &amp; k@@ ale album , the exported database as described in .
the wizard to import consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , after which folder the import images are to be copied .
it may be that you are named the category persons of the imported file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) while this category is asked at your base persons . therefore , you are asked in the third dialogue window what categories of imported file are to be imported and which categories they correspond to your database .
in the fourth step you can see the categories of the imported file using the categories of your current database . an example for this is shown on the picture .
it has to be easy to browse images and watch : if you look at pictures , you can often look inside from different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash , if you look at the example pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the images on which this friend is depicted .
in this hand@@ book , you will undergo the various steps of ( 1 ) celebration of information about your pictures , via ( 2 ) through searching and viewing until ( 3 ) advanced themes and adap@@ tations .
K@@ Photo Album was started as a program for the administration of your pictures . but it has been extended and today taking care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this also includes videos with one .
&amp; Tra@@ velo@@ album ; all his information stores in the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . these are a simple XML file , which you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal he@@ dging , copy , on a flo@@ ppy disk or revisions in the CV@@ S , where you would like .
&amp; Tra@@ velo@@ album ; notice the folder in which your images are saved and used these at future starts . if you want to read a different database in &amp; k@@ ak@@ h . if you want to check a different folder tree with images , you can launch a different folder tree with images , you can start &amp; kiss . with the option -@@ c . as example : k@@ nu@@ dge -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml .
through the menu item settings col@@ t album ; set up ... you will arrive at a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; nbsp ; in the following section of the user guide you will be explained the different settings options .
to the left you see six different symbols that allow you to preview the preview options and options for the viewer . for each attitude a detailed assistance is available , which can be accessed by one touch to the F1 button and a click on the desired option .
you have described how you can specify different properties for every picture , e.g. people , locations and tags . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals , or albums .
click on the dialog , which is used to process already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a let@@ tering and a symbol .
sub@@ categories are already mentioned . in the dialog options you can set up complete members , i.e. , for example , all members of a group at one time are set in a group instead of explaining all groups of a link .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the list of options available to you , the list of members can be made available . with the selection list , you can select the category you want . in the left window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ ale album ; shares his modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module name means K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin interface . nutritional information can be found on the home page of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called via the menu modules . they can not be described in this hand@@ book , as they are not part of &amp; the photo@@ sets ; but they are sold separately . however , most modules also have a help page that you can access via the module itself .
since the modules are used by multiple applications together with each other , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; nbsp ; therefore , you should always test new modules first with the demo database , before you access these onto your own pictures application &gt; k@@ ale album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or through the menu Help . do not say , I would not have warned you !
the applications that use the modules on K@@ IP@@ I together are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; nbsp ; don &apos;t work . this is the downside if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ es@@ days ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications supported their pictures in albums : here is an album simply a folder . even though &amp; nbsp ; this type of order is not supported , sim@@ ulates it for some modules the order after albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ ale album .
here , sim@@ ulated &amp; k@@ ly album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all images , which shows you the picture preview at the moment .
besides the current album , &amp; k@@ days album , the modules also pass a list of albums . here goes &amp; k@@ days album ; as follows :
when &amp; nbsp ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will be the category that you specified in the dialog dialog as a category for virtual albums . therefore , if you , for example , use the category persons , will do &amp; k@@ day album ; so do if you choose to select people and share this with the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ ú@@ s are not compatible you can remove them from the list of modules . start the dialog dialog box and select in the area modules which modules should be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example for a home screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ day@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to see it from any other KDE application , take a look at the top of a menu and a tool@@ bar . at the moment , you will not have a lot of information , as you do not have any information about your pictures . in the section , we will be able to view this window , but now click on the record image , which shows you an overview with all existing images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ adi album ; is the possibility to see any picture with notes . these include information about the people depicted on the picture etc. you can put each image either individually or for a larger number of pictures specific comments at the same time . if , for example , pic@@ tured on all pictures , Jes@@ per and all pictures in Copenhagen have been included .
all these notes may be used for seeking and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these remarks if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in see three lists of a text box by choosing persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ days album ; because you will use them again and again if you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea lies the moving of images within the list : if you have for example a family party , and on all 50 pictures shown the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can , therefore , the names used up are moved to the top of the ones to find and classi@@ fy the people faster .
if you prefer to see an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting after date under the list .
if you have selected any remarks individually for each image , you might want to edit all selected images and add these pictures with remarks . in this case , simply click on the button below and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the picture on the right .
if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it may then more comfortable all these images to mark and use the menu @-@ point entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the United States . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
in the picture you see a browser window that displays the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is an over@@ time , a special symbol is shown .
in the context menu of the list@@ ings , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also make an entry to a category and disc@@ ard it in order to sort out this one sub@@ category of this item . attention , this requires you to sort out your categories alphabe@@ tically . see for this .
you can move the individual elements of the feature by clicking on the bar that form the edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make a separate window by setting it out of the window parti@@ tions .

you can also delete images in the picture preview . simply select the appropriate images from which you would like to delete , or select either the Dele@@ te button , or select from the Edit menu , so you can see the window you can see in the picture .
&amp; Tra@@ velo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use &amp; k@@ ale album ; i.e. images too , without you saved on the hard disk . of course , you need to record the images somewhere , so that &amp; k@@ ale album ; in the picture you can view the view of &amp; Co@@ stan@@ album . if not all necessary photos can be loaded from the hard disk .
pictures in which the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the thumb@@ nails are available , so that &amp; k@@ m. they show you the preview of these images . however , you can also view these pictures with the image concerned .
as you can see this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and copy again . &amp; nbsp ; supports it until now not you want to avoid the inser@@ tion of the relevant CD . if you want to avoid anger , how to avoid the mess @-@ in of your pictures , please buy a larger hard disk in order to store all the pictures afterwards .

in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the properties tab and display the object in the wi@@ re@@ model .
you can also select multiple items at the same time . but not the object of a already selected object , as all subjects are already chosen with the object .

the scre@@ enshot shows the check@@ points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse button and thus change the position and direction of the camera .
once a transformation is chosen , the check@@ points disappear and it will display a small cross in the wire model . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift through distor@@ ting with the mouse within the whole window .
each object has a visual level as a wire model . you can indicate this value relative to the visibility of the overall object or as an absolute value . objects will only be displayed when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the level of the tool@@ bar of the scene .

if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ own it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; use &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to rendering , this program has to be properly installed . as this manual is written &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 to date . this version is in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 not supported .
to ren@@ der@@ ate the current scene , click on the icon ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item in the tool@@ bar .
a R@@ ender mode matches the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of the rendering . if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full pictures in the highest quality .
if you click on the symbol The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar or in View Mode ... select , the following dialogue will be opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , it makes sense , but a name that lets the features of the mode can be recognized .
in the body card size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you only want to select a small area of the image , select the section section below and enter the image section to the rendering field .
in the Com@@ bin@@ ational field Quality you can select the characteristics that use &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . this is from a very simple color and lighting model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ user reflections . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user manual too &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
when a picture is lo@@ oted with only one beam per pixel , various errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ che @-@ pattern or ste@@ ep@@ y @-@ effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect means ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally speaking , pictures with this feature are better .
if you turn off anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculated and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than a ray per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because every pixel is constantly split and adap@@ tive because each pixel climb@@ s up again and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ sion depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray a beam up pixel . if the difference between color values to the specified pixels , then , both pixels are calculated by the tracking of a particular additional number of pixels with super sampling . if you set the low value on 4 , a guard of 4x@@ 4 extra points will be calculated , at a depth of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the pre @-@ defined threshold , then the pixels is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels that will be followed individually and be tested on further sub@@ divisions . the maximum depth of recur@@ sion can be set with the lowering .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generating noise for the beam process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn off j@@ it@@ tering , changed &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the final setting for the quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; which diff@@ use diff@@ use light reflection . it takes very long to let a scene with this property .
on this map you can set whether the Alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the associated rays have not made an object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ account output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expec@@ tedly ends , you can find the reason for it here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; scene can import , select the menu entry File Im@@ ported ... and select a file in dialogue window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; Not yet the full instruction of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; . if at import@@ ing error messages or warnings , a dialogue window shows a list of all reports .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ Be@@ gin and / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ End .
you can draw objects from the object tree in the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . this adds to the source code of the object to import objects in the editor , just highlight the source code in the editor and drag it into the tree @-@ tree .
with copying and Past@@ ing in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : a scene f@@ ells . usually , this is Po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ Po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click in the self @-@ owner view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation for the displayed object . set the path to your documentation and version . the version 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 will be supported .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example al@@ timeter ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file occurs in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color of the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color will be used for viewing points . the second color is used for viewing the check@@ points .
the colour of the rectangular area for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type labels .
you can set the sheet @-@ catch of the points on the grid @-@ menu in the context menu of the wire model . you can set the buttons separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation .
greater values results in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but do not require more time to rendering it . for some objects such as the ball , you can adjust the detailed press for two directions .
if you cross the High Detailed proj@@ ections for extended proj@@ ections , all the wire method are further divided , if the camera is used an advanced projection . extended proj@@ ections , all proj@@ ections , with exceptions of perspective and the vertically proj@@ ections . this property gives a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to rendering .
if you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is displayed in a chess @-@ board pattern of two single @-@ stell@@ ae colors .
if you cross the floor , a ground is lo@@ oted below the objects . the ground is shown in a chess @-@ board pattern from two single @-@ stell@@ able colors .
if you cross edge smoo@@ thes , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be set . more precise information about the parameters can be found in section R@@ ender @-@ modes .
this page allows you to change existing window regulations or create new window rules . in the window panel , you will be explained how to create and store window rules .
the Com@@ bin@@ ations Standard @-@ shut@@ ters : displays all existing shut@@ ters . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the chosen window @-@ order at the start of the program .
the list of existing shut@@ ters shows all existing shut@@ ters . you can create a new arrangement with the button Add and delete a selected arrangement with the button removal .
every window of window is identified by the name . the name must be clearly and must not be empty .
the list under the name displays all views of the selected window order . new views can create you with the button Add and select selected views with the button Dele@@ te .
the position of the new window . with new column , create a new column on the right hand side of the existing window , with un@@ locks , you get the window under the existing window , coupled with the previous view and web@@ end , the view does not lock in the main window but creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you would like to follow no more exact knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , including beginners very popular : a bul@@ let at a level .
but you should notice the following warnings carefully before you complain that as a result you only receive a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should note these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set camera , no rules can be applied to the rendering , as a result you will get a black image .
if you don &apos;t insert any light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture .
to install everything from error @-@ free , take a look at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : the following set of shut@@ ters :
take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so you can get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols for a lot of time , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their applications .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : start with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree first . highlight the scene and then select the menu item er@@ asing . so you have a scene without objects .
the wir@@ ing model shows how the camera sees the whole scene that you create . in particular , please note that in the fourth wire pattern ( right down ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ derer .
the object tree now includes a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of view properties available in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user &apos;s guide to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , you will find more details .
don &apos;t change anything on the basic settings of the camera , this is subject to later instructions , but note that the camera will change the check@@ points with which you can change the point of view of the camera . just click with the left mouse button and draw it to the desired location .
when you apply the button or push the button @-@ button , the wire @-@ wire views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could , for example , insert a Qu@@ ader ( insert End@@ less body Qu@@ aders ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an amazing method of solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : actually offers an easier way to use . you can use an infinite level as ground :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the button and then press the button @-@ button . in the object tree the new name will immediately be displayed .
the wir@@ ing model also shows the level , even at the moment only as a limited point . if you ren@@ ders the scene , the flat is stretched to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree exactly , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case , you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the property properties .
in this scene , you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the sky@@ line , just so you get to know some of these parameters . select a shift and set the values as below :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something in the moment .
in both cases a dialog , in which you can select how the object is to be inserted . please choose a subject object . the pig@@ ment is then displayed in the object tree ( name = bottom @-@ pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview how the pig@@ ment looks now .
of course , the preview of the pig@@ ment only needs a mat@@ ured black material , because you need to browse settings for the pig@@ ment still . do not always keep in mind that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . also , there are many possibilities , but you now take the easiest .
if you don &apos;t have a color on the Qu@@ ader and the ball in the preview , then click on the button and then call the thumb@@ nails .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you select your image now with a click on the icon , you should receive the following result :
of course this is not the color that you expect . here are further settings necessary . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me . choose this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the box list can only be used with two colors ) :
select in the object tree any time and change the colors in the view of the properties tab :
this step should be easy to perform , since you should have understood the fundamental working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : the ball is just as easy to create as the soil :
in view of the properties tab , you can instantly change the settings . put the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the buttons , or the button ) , so the ball would float above the ground , as you have moved the floor around one unit down .
of course , the rendering is a strange result : as seen before , the ball @-@ surface looks like a fro@@ g black material . in the following step , you can find a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can assign a material now . like on the ground , give the ball a pig@@ ment as color :
select accommodation object and change the name for example in sphere of pig@@ ment . click on the pig@@ ment of the pig@@ ment , select and insert the values as below :
but you can gain more exciting effects if you take the time to stop some finish features :
then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on the input button .
the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection are already partial visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med finishes , even if metal@@ lic : not selected at all :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : but hopefully you &apos;ve already learned so much that you can create simple but nice scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a successful method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
when you have a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en , the ren@@ derer &apos;s hypo@@ the@@ tical beams from the perspective of the be@@ holder ( i.e. from the camera , which mir@@ r@@ ates the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the R@@ ender is reflected , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects work like for example . thus the scene pixels is processed for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye , by which you see the scene . without a light source , you also see nothing , the picture is just black . obviously need any scene that should be en@@ acted , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ;
always when you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted in this sub@@ menu and replace the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . it is a new file , you must enter a name and disk space .
displays the scene in the last recorded version . all changes since the last storage are dis@@ car@@ ded .
you can only select this menu item when you still don &apos;t have stored modifications in the scene .
repeatedly the last und@@ ated command . this menu item can only select if you have used editing routine .
save the current window order and opens a dialog , where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or write an existing order .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the standard behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new commands to this option for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ;
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove tool@@ bar for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler or models .
a dump map is a way to present rough surfaces without having to model any bu@@ mp on the surface individually and without changing the geom@@ etrical form of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for both a pump @-@ map and for a texture map .
basic body are simple geom@@ etric shapes you can use as components : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models will then be revised to give them a realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object on pixel base , by applying a image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a Com@@ fortable image browser and browser . the application features a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the picture or in full @-@ screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files you can click with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ T ; or the Return / key .
you can set whether every image should be displayed in a separate window , or if all images always use the same window .
if you &apos;re looking for a specific file , simply tap the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a password file is highlighted , the file will be highlighted . you can exit the input field by pushing Return or &amp; Es@@ cape .
in the dialog request - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five body cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set in the two other , short @-@ command for the display cabinet and short @-@ command for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cut can be specified for the respective window .
if this is selected , then the images are opened in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the ad surface with the background color is filled with the background color that you can set on down . default is not a full @-@ screen mode .
is this point activated , invites &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay whenever you choose the next image and is particularly suitable for slide show .
with this option stores &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when finishing the name of the last opened order . the next start opens &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored beams in order to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode , window appears larger than the image , here the background is filled with the selected color .
you can set &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; so set up that only some of the data types will be displayed , which can also be represented by the program .
this option allows for large images to be displayed on the full screen . this option is switched as default .
lay out if the slideshow is to begin with the first image in a folder or with the selected image .
the time frame between the change in a slide show . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the small arrows on the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds .
the number of re@@ ps is set to 0 , the slideshow is repeated until it gets dis@@ continued by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . default is 1 .
change here the key@@ note for the different modes of operation by &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the top cards du@@ command@@ ing for the display cabinet and short @-@ command for the browser .
with this option you switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large symbols for files in the folder . this display is only possible in short notice .
shows small symbols for files in the folder . this display is only possible in short notice .
displays thumb@@ nails for files in the folder . this display is only possible in short notice .
shr@@ inks the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
the image increased by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the picture .
closes the display cabinet for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is also closed if no browser window is open anymore .
display the image into original size . this is only useful when the automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the file you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; Cou@@ ture ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Photo@@ production based on the publication ; image processing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the publication ; project .
&amp; Cou@@ ture ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user contributes to its part , at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; Cou@@ ture ; makes you feel as easy as possible mistakes or possible improvements . the menu features a dialogue with a link . if you use this , your browser will open a page to reports about problems and wishes . all required information is already completed and you can simply follow the instructions to release your message .
&amp; Cou@@ ture ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers will help each other . if you are a common user @-@ mail list of &amp; show@@ rooms . however , you may ask questions to other users of the show@@ rooms . however , in this mailing list is English spoken , you should therefore be powerful this language .
the best start to participate in the show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list as join . guidance to join the developers mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&amp; show@@ photo ; try to give you so much control over his work processes as possible . to change to these settings , you &apos;ll need to set up on these settings , in the menu settings show@@ rooms . you can switch between these settings by pressing on the icons of the left side .
in the area of Bel@@ i@@ ecting indi@@ ces you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ loaded indicator , the colors should be selected with what you should display , at the contrast . under@@ load should display a bright color and over@@ load a dark color .
the main window of the &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side bar at the right edge , which provides important information and promotions to the selected images . you can also see it in the picture editing . you can view it by clicking on one of the five hor@@ semen :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that does not save more than images and save .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that does not save more than scan and save images ; can save for each image a dialog to store or save the pictures immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the photos in front of the store .
you can check the status of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set in the command line from &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner was specified , then a dialog to choose the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner and push OK to open the scanner . ab@@ ort &amp; sk@@ an end ; end .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( li@@ b@@ link ) , these options are not particularly treated .
in order to can@@ opy a picture , the user can only start a pre @-@ shoot and then scan the scan for the final scan . the preview can be started through the preview @-@ button .
to select the picture better , the user can select the image inside and out of the current selection out . it can also set the z@@ oom as well that the complete preview of the window fits .
if the image was selected then the final picture can be read with a scan button .
if before saving a preview display in the settings , then the image is displayed in a preview window as shown below . if save is pressed , then the image will be saved and sle@@ y ? en leads to a demo@@ lition and you will return to the main window .
with the button settings the ep@@ onymous dialogue will be opened before the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option to be displayed on Save a preview is selected . if this preview is not required by the user then the option has to be chosen .
this setting allows them to select the way you want to open . dialog to save for each image opens the dialogue in front of each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; these automatically save with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to save saving without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are saved from the option ( saving ) saving on a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder will be used as standard for dialogue to store . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatically mem@@ or@@ zed images and , in addition , the proposed name for the image in the dialog to store . the automatically stored picture gets a numer@@ ical bre@@ ix of each time , when a picture is stored . the string , # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adapt the image quality to save image quality . this value also changes the compression value when saving . when choosing the image quality is not selected , then the standard value is used by Q@@ t .
the button @-@ help starts the KDE Help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ Manual . the button Over starts the KDE over -@@ Dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and shots can be used to stop &amp; sk@@ ite .

you can possibly set up existing multimedia keys so that they function as &amp; Amar@@ o@@ OK ; -@@ short rest . this makes your keyboard on the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control centre .
the D@@ COP @-@ Interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions which are mostly also found in other KDE programs . this section is made up of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ COP @-@ functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists browsers and scripts . an example call for the D@@ COP @-@ function pause could be &amp; eg . look like :
Amar@@ o@@ K supports the command @-@ lines of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; . in addition , Amar@@ o@@ ah has some own command @-@ lines options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script should not be executed due to missing dependency . please check in your script as if all required modules are present and use dialog , so that the user knows why a script does not run .

in the folder of scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as the basis for your own scripts , or simply extend it to the functions required . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ COP , your scripts can be exchanged with Amar@@ o@@ ok and Amar@@ o@@ v . the simplest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should be enclosed in any KDE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the ex@@ iting of external programs and commands . in addition , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy to be called . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; sends messages to all ongoing scripts . for this reason , scripts should be monitored on the standard typ@@ ing the script . for this reason , scripts , scripts , script should also ignore the events if there is no use for it .
configure We@@ is the script to view the setup dialog . to save the storing and loading of the ordering data , any script needs to take care of . when a script starts , Amar@@ o@@ ok put the work folder in the folder , where all data should be stored .
tr@@ ack@@ Change sign@@ aled that a new piece is all@@ ot@@ ted . the script might ask now &amp; eg ; with D@@ COP @-@ functions to further information about the new piece ( for example the metadata or the dimensions ) .
volume @-@ Change new@@ Volume signal a change in volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ar Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu grants to the selected files of the playlist , when a custom menu item can be identified . to add the menu to your own entry , you can remove the D@@ COP @-@ function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ Script ™ Custom@@ ize Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu Pho@@ al@@ It@@ em ) . to remove an entry to remove d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ ire remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu of each ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; ex@@ terminated , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal S@@ IG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed in order to do e.g. re@@ tool@@ ing , for example , to store data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ Archive ( .t@@ ar ) which can be optional also with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which can be optional also with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , so that the user can recognize the archive clearly as a Amar@@ o@@ ire script .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the extending amar@@ ok@@ ator script . for this reason , you should design@@ ate your script packages right .
the main trans@@ cription has to be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining to lad@@ ent modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file right :

actual piece on the piece change can be revealed that the play@@ lists windows open up / rolls to keep the running piece always in the visible window range .
switching to the context browser automatically changes the context browser , as soon as the next piece is played .
in the section image , you can customize &amp; Amar@@ o@@ gram ; the section is divided into three parts sub@@ section .
in the fon@@ ts section you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ v . they can choose according to mark@@ ers of own writings . you can select ty@@ pe@@ faces for the following area : playlist windows , player window and context browser . press to select ... , so you can choose a type of font in the selection dialog .
with the selection of customised color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . do you use the color @-@ in color for front and background color .
reproduction at the start causes that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; after the program start the reproduction will automatically continue with the piece on the spot , with which they have stopped at the last finish .
the sub@@ window On @-@ screen display allow you to disable the OS@@ D . if on @-@ screen display is displayed , a preview of the OS@@ D will display and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview .

the computer screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . you can specify on which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the OS@@ D will appear .
the cri@@ mp@@ e audio @-@ output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down field . some drivers enable further settings in this map .
the cart tab is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for collection .
here you can select the folder that is to search &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the cross @-@ section next to its name . this section also contains instructions for setting , as well as the selected folders .
sub@@ folder recur@@ sively : this causes that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders according to music is seen .

play@@ lists import : causes &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in their collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added playlist will appear later in the play@@ lists .
the part collection database is used for choosing a database for the collection . the Com@@ bin@@ ational Device driver : can you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , another device is needed in the sub@@ window My@@ S@@ q@@ l institution .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l device is used for setting up the database for &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . among others it is being entered into the database where the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name , to which the connection is established .
use user name : and password : to enter the data required to connect to the database .
the pati@@ ble card last@@ .@@ f@@ m depends on the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; can provide the names of played pieces on a load .@@ f@@ m server , and if needed , create music @-@ recommendations regarding the current piece .
here you enter your username and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .

similar interpreter : after activating this attitude , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar performer can be reported to the each played piece . note : you can view the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a load .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; eg ; Linux ) . you can find more information in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen photos .
Amar@@ o@@ K requires only the package of K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other KDE packages . you have to be installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small instruction how to make K@@ ail@@ or minimal .
some features such as OS@@ D pre@@ dict that your window manager will perform the relevant standards of free@@ des@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome is effective for example . we try to support Amar@@ o@@ K on all platforms , therefore we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ li@@ b library for days . you can see this file fin@@ er by clicking on ~ / .@@ k@@ / / share / apps / Amar@@ o@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also attach the cap@@ ut@@ te file that caused the crash . then you can delete the file and let the collection again .
most of the cases is that Tag@@ lib will cr@@ ashes when reading the Met@@ a information from that file . please report that error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure that all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version have been compiled . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ o@@ v ; with GCC 3.4 , day li@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x compiled , then this leads to dis@@ closing the met@@ a information .
if you are KDE with art@@ s@@ d then de@@ activate machines . turn off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least not a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the bakery via e @-@ mail ( the E @-@ Mail opens automatically with a crash ) . if it is a commonly called crash and you send us a good che@@ que , the error is guaranteed .
this is because many program data can write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 in the met@@ a info , but they do not mark as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; File $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; fault in writing the tags from $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; unless $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ C@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; s Symb@@ ols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynam@@ ical playlist ) see in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . however , you will find the status De@@ activate in Gray and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases , you have to click on a icon for up to three times until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : sign @-@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pixels , then check if Amar@@ o@@ K is the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos;s _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ di@@ fying Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf , that Amar@@ o@@ ah finds the right version first .
there are some possibilities . most of the installation problems is easiest for the help of an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or with the developers . use the forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ eno@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ o@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter there only an error if you &apos;re looking for a bug in Amar@@ o@@ ok .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; appears only a blank playlist . how do music fit there ?
this is easy . use the navig@@ ator on the left and open the folder you want . then drag files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intuitive , the start @-@ window was converted to the statistics window . you will find it among extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ o@@ 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are available for evaluation by the user , while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces , needs to be displayed in the playlist of the playlist and select column . click anywhere into the new application column , to specify the review for one piece . you can also use the short command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ o@@ v is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press release on your keyboard . or click with the right button of the mouse on your selection and then select from the playlist menu .
drag a playlist file with your mouse into the playlist and let it fall there just like you would do it with other files . that &apos;s the way : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right beside the Add @-@ button , you can save the button playlist . click on it .
probably you have missing the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; new . check out also after li@@ b@@ ble this package contains many very nice visu@@ alis@@ ations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . besides , you will find him via the menu bar among extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no . yes , this is true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one from the back@@ end independent approach , hence the actual question must be supported G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support pretty much every conceivable audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer may even de@@ code text and P@@ NG !
it may ! maybe use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which in pre@@ pres@@ et no MP3 @-@ decor or co @-@ delivered ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : old @-@ F@@ 2 , g@@ g : Red@@ hat mp3 k@@ de , input taste
start the Ya@@ que Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa S@@ ink , the device needs to make a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneous audio . this can be reached by a sound card with hardware mix@@ er ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( Software @-@ mix@@ er ) . see the assistance D@@ mix for Al@@ sa .
the output of this command should help you find the problem @-@ free and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to provide a different S@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ wa@@ v ) .
that does &amp; Amar@@ o@@ v ; already . do not forget that media must first be de@@ coded . G@@ Stre@@ amer is for most people the best choice if you &apos;re looking for a dé@@ cor with little over@@ head . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ code them and sends the PC@@ M data to Al@@ sa . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codi@@ fies the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer may be printed directly to Al@@ sa , as well as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable Sound@@ server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of sound @-@ buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper SU@@ ID is set :
with KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed play@@ back . read this error report . the magni@@ fying the sound @-@ buff@@ ers in your Al@@ se @-@ furnishings .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either do not use the Arts device but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install KDE @-@ Multimedia to obtain the quicker Arts @-@ co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ m@@ pe@@ gli@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc . ) .
probably you use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts @-@ Pu@@ ffer in control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less yields the visu@@ alis@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us to fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to change to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , there is Amar@@ o@@ ah . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer you will need to register all the components . run G@@ ST @-@ register to register all the be@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this does not help , you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( end Amar@@ o@@ a@@ v before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then delete the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST @-@ register once again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .

&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ COP that is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and run with the alarm of this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed then you are awakened by the gentle sounds of the music that you have stopped right before bed .
how can I hear the current in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; enter the tracks on another computer ?
if a functioning SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command tells you interpre@@ ts and title of the current piece : ssh -@@ I ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ use Amar@@ o@@ player now Play@@ ing
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires that your identification in the file ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA is present .
the visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ window separated . add to it on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in its size changeable window .
the combination of Str@@ g + right mouse button puts a piece in the click @-@ on succession in queue . by pressing the input point , after a search in the playlist , the first search results is played and the search has been reset .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ ck@@ est functions , but what about the symbol in the system section of the control panel ?
click with &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser should be displayed .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on an NFS drive . after starting Amar@@ o@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and on the console has many error messages . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ / / share / apps / Amar@@ o@@ ok on a local drive or use am@@ aro@@ K@@ s MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on audio CD menu . it opens up a file browser with multiple folders . to the normal read , select a few pieces and drag them in the desired target folder in a par@@ ap@@ or window . for automatic code , instead , you can convert files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g .

basically , this fits the previous review with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the play has been played , the more often the play has been played , the less impact every single assessment has on the overall result .
you can list the rating for a piece by yourself by clicking on a column table in the play@@ lists . there you can change the rating of one piece , just as all the other attributes , namely by clicking on the piece click on the piece and edit : review or edit F@@ 2 . you can also edit the review in the dialog metadata .
the developers would not like to suggest that when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ o@@ ok . this means the KDE packages have a fixed release plan not to bring together with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ o@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ o@@ ok , which some users can find quite annoying . disable the option icon of playing animations in the general settings .
the analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool@@ bar ... and make the desired changes .
download a design , or create your own . then install this under Amar@@ o@@ ok ... appearance context browser design , click new design to install ...
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphi@@ cs Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) to avoid difficulties , it was removed .
Kon@@ quer@@ or navigation field offers you the monitoring and control of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; while you browse Con@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation area . then click the button Settings ( the top one ) and select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button on the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service to be sent to information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free of charge and you need only a free user name and a password . Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is completely supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
if you want to use Al@@ sa then please get the newest version . old Al@@ sa versions have a lot of stor@@ my and therefore a lot of error reports caused .
presumably was &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; compile before you have x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer installed . therefore , the / configure routine has not compiled this output module . you must re@@ configure &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
probably you use a distribution which is installed from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer are installed separately from the actual program , you need to install the necessary development files . the same goes for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you must re@@ compile and install again .
I get the mistake G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ Cri@@ tical * * : factory for &apos; ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How do I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ ayed , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without p@@ rel@@ inking . a tip of Merlin T@@ TC : used no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ o@@ v .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , you have to be installed beside the stre@@ amer cas@@ ad also the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time .
you will get the mistake There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play a MP3 @-@ stream , but the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as system manager G@@ ST @-@ register . then Amar@@ o@@ K will start anew .
I have a second sound card and I use Al@@ sa . how can I use Amar@@ o@@ ah the second sound card ?
taking settings Amar@@ o@@ OK ... audio @-@ output can enter the device . typical is for example h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 @-@ Code@@ c and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ N@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug wei@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l. smart { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug h@@ ub@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l. us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
in the interior dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the scan@@ rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , you can disable the tick on sound card supports m@@ map .
we are sorry but the audio edition with Arts will not be taken care of . of course , you are welcome to take this problem yourself ! if you like , you can become the new so badly needed care officer for Arts : )
music should be quite easy ! for this reason , there is the interior assistant at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . if you want to update your collection again , or simply do not like the assistant then this fast start @-@ guide will be a help . with her help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ o@@ OK ; in a few minutes .
to create a playlist is very easy . drag the mouse entries from the collection browser into the playlist . type a bit into the text@@ box . if you are satisfied with the playlist settings , you can save them with the help of the playlist playlist . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the playlist window .
if you have own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist of your collection . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , then you will find the option to import files . with a right click on a playlist you will receive different ways , how the playlist should be loaded .
to play an audio CD , select an audio CD in the menu bar , please select an audio CD menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and the CD @-@ pieces in the WA@@ V format . drag the WA@@ V files into the playlist and then push the button playing .
the audio CD feature is using the audi@@ o@@ d protocol : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function can also be found in the playlist . just click with the right mouse button on an entry and follow the burning menu . you will have different possibilities for burning a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; sets the installation of some software packages . also , the required packages are listed below . also , some additional packages are listed , which make working with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; comfortable .
if you install these packages on a package management system ( e.g. R@@ PM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player also has &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however a playlist that is superior to all the other . the play@@ lists window contains several browsers with which you can capture and search your entire music collection .
in this chapter we explain how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; used , including creating a collection and a playlist .
the Player window is your A @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window there is a run text display , which indicates the current current piece or the current stream stream . just below is the area , the playing time , bitter@@ ness and sample @-@ up of the current piece . a click on this area changes the display of the already exp@@ ired game time to still remaining players of the piece .
furthermore , the Player window contains a selection of audio @-@ analy@@ zers , also among the run texts . you can switch through the available analy@@ zer by clicking on the area &apos;s left mouse button .
the &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; -@@ Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press it on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will display in an independent , enlarged window .
under the run texts are also the buttons PL and E@@ Q . the button PL is activated or de@@ activ@@ ates the play@@ lists window , while the button E@@ Q is used to set up E@@ quali@@ zer .
the rest of the player &apos;s window is made up of playing buttons , the volume @-@ volume and the piece of posi@@ tional sli@@ ders . use the sli@@ ders to start the piece position or the volume . with the play@@ back buttons , you can start the play@@ back / stop and change the next or previous piece .
the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create their own preferences .
to view the E@@ quali@@ zer menu , use extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main men@@ ue or click the E@@ Q in Player window . once you select the E@@ quali@@ zer field , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is the most advanced play@@ list of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that there is no other player in any other player . but do not allow yourself to deter@@ red from the abundance of functions , they are all easy to use .
the playlist can be split into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation area . in the navigation area you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . on the right , you can use the playlist yourself . however , the playlist is easy to use and still is powerful enough for advanced users .
the context browser displays various information regarding the one &apos;s current piece . its appearance can be adjusted with the help of context browser design . the context browser includes three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ ts . these three sub @-@ windows are presented later into detail . they represent information about the ongoing piece on each of these different aspects .
if you already have earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; you might be aware that the sub @-@ window has been cut off . the information presented there can now be distributed in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ah ; in addition , the information in the statistics window is collected .
the sub@@ window music shows information about the currently running piece , as well as the interpreter and the album .
the first section in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , performer and the album . below you see the cover image of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to copy the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you will find more information about the current piece . you see here how often and when the play was played for the first and last time as well as its assessment .
to view cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ jpg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gif and .@@ p@@ n@@ g are supported . the context browser will also show cover images that were downloaded either with cover management or set in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next area , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will immediately turn off .
among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this performer . this area displays the five highest rated figures of the current interpreter .

the button Edi@@ ting allows you to edit the lyrics . the changed version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collector database . this is no running text script necessary .
the button Find opens a search for google.com to the song text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing interpre@@ ters - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece is shown directly below the interpreter . albums or gen@@ res are completely ignored .
group@@ ing interpreter / album - First will be sorted the pieces according to the performer . if you want to see comp@@ il@@ ations or soundtrack albums , this is the best view on your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list with different interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing interpreter / year - Album - Sor@@ ted to Interpre@@ t and then after the year of album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year for an album is unknown , the standard 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by each other . the performer is ignored .
group@@ ing genre / performer - your pieces are shown first to genre , and below , according to interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing genre / performer - This setting works just like the above , but also sorted by album below the interpreter .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust the group@@ ing entirely to Bel@@ i@@ eben and combine .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the collection will automatically capture your collection once you own something about the selected folders . if you have many pieces , this could take a while .
right under the tool@@ bar is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the construction supervision . notes for the use of this filter you can find in the section to playlist in this manual .
under the search filter is a selection box , with whose help you can filter the final pieces to your collection . you will be able to choose different time windows , from the last 24 hours to one year . besides , you can also select your total collection , whereby the filter is practically switched off .
by clicking with the right mouse button , on an entry in the collection browser you will receive the following possibilities .
download - This lick the current playlist and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order in the play@@ back .
playlist files - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you can reach the same effect .
queue in queue - This function adds the selected pieces in queue . this will take you next .
when playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you are asked for a name under which the list should be stored .
to transfer media player - Add the pieces in queue for transmission to the media player . further details can be found in the section on the Media Player browser .
all pieces of this interpreter burn / burn to CD - Dad@@ ant , the selected pieces will be sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as data or as audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
metadata ( for n pieces ) edit ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) files in the du@@ st@@ bin shift ... - Op@@ ens a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
as a compilation highlight - Select the selected album as a compilation , promp@@ ting it to be different interpre@@ ters .
assemb@@ ling @-@ mark@@ er - changes as a compilation made album back to a normal album . after that , the album is not shown more under different interpre@@ ters but again under the performer .
the play@@ lists has a simple way to deal with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes smart play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist browser includes the intelligent play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for running time . smart play@@ lists are made up of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that has never been played before .
also this smart play@@ lists are possible . click &quot; Add to smart playlist , to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist . there , you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the sub@@ window Media Player is used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; to be able to use for example your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt @-@ i@@ pod ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; start , you will find the pieces on your iPod according to Interpre@@ t sorted in the upper floor view of the Media Player @-@ browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and leave them on the list . if you are done , click on transm@@ itter . thereby the pieces will be up@@ loaded onto your iPod . when the transmission is completed , finish &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and trigger the drive delivery for your iPod .
under the tool@@ bar you find a search area with which you can search for a file . searching is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden , which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file &apos;s browser there is a address bar that allows you to enter music from an integrated URL . if you want to enter music from an integrated URL , you can enter music in the file musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .@@ gz and now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window square , the susp@@ end files can be difficult by simply pit@@ falls . in this case , the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : by default , the holding files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list and not on the corner .
the playlist won all of you to download the attached pieces . you can change the sequence using the file simply using the mouse at the desired location . once you enter letters , only the pieces are included . to reset the filter , you press as long as the button down , until the text box is again empty .
when you enter with spaces of separate search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . if you enter for e.g. two three , the search will find all entries , one , two and three .
if you enter between the search terms OR search , searches for one or the other search criteria . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces will be found , one or two or three ( or a combination of it ) .
if you would like to search for entries , the blank spaces then include the search term with ge@@ ese : Mike Old@@ field . thus , for entries sought by Mike Old@@ field , but not for contracts like Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search column , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : review : &gt; 50@@ . this looks for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term , make a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine this syn@@ theses in combination with one another . example : Mike Old@@ field OR Post : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this searches for all pieces that contain either Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and not contain a comment .
you can set the cancellation sequence of entries by holding the str@@ tr@@ l button down , and then click with the right mouse button in the required order to click the entries . the entries then receive a marking with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be reproduced .
the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . at the left you find the button Add to the button . on the right side you can find playlist , playlist , empty and random@@ ly M@@ ic .
next , the buttons are set to shape and restore , so you can re@@ vert changes to the playlist or restore it .
in the middle of the tool@@ bar is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the refres@@ her can be adjusted with one click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that which you can see in the player window on the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
there are many more available buttons for the tool@@ bar , for example , ren@@ dition and volume controls . you can set the buttons , clicking on the menu and set up there tool@@ box .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information available to playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the duration of all pieces . in addition , the status for random mode and play@@ time is displayed . the status for random mode and retri@@ ev@@ ing is easy to change by clicking with the mouse dou@@ ble@@ in the appropriate display area .
you can also hide the status bar , or disable the status bar in general settings .
the menu item can be accessed by a click with the right mouse button of the player window , or by clicking on the playlist on the menu . via this menu you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok .
a click on this entry opens the window visu@@ alization plug @-@ ins . there you can select the visu@@ alis@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok .
behind this entry , a sub@@ menu with short@@ cuts to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; .
the covers management is a useful means to manage your cover images . you can start it by selecting action cover art management in the collection browser .
the cover @-@ management includes a list of view of all albums in your collection . you can view all of the albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the interpreter on the left .
with the View menu you can choose what to be displayed in the cover management board . choose from :
the queu@@ es managed in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature you have even more control over the playlist . after having a piece into queue there will be a number next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play at first : 1 will first be played , 2 as a second , and so on .
the management of the queu@@ es open up to queue . if you want to add a piece of the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also use the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the sequence of the pieces in the queue .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already provided ( the details about the establishment of these follow later ) .
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds further random pieces while playing another random pieces .
adds pieces based on last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( previously : audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you do not need last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to function this dynamic playlist .
click on the desired playlist , drag it to the playlist window or click with the right button of the mouse on you and then select loading . in this way , your current playlist is replaced by the new one . so you should save the old playlist under circumstances !
the two proposed modes of random mix and play@@ lists are immediately complete your playlist and you can add play@@ back play@@ lists . you will need to add a playlist of your collection and you need to add at least one piece itself from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at the next piece of time , so your playlist won &apos;t be filled just at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the latest possible dynamic mode : settings dynamic mode . this will also use your existing playlist as a starting point . the dynamic mode can also be de@@ activated via the same menu item .
the button Neu fill the current playlist and adds new pieces according to dynamic mode . playlist , edit the dialog to do the playlist and you can change the corresponding settings .
with a right click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit but@@ ton@@ . then the dialog opens to do the settings of the playlist .
please insert any name for the playlist . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist won continuously grow , the setting for coming pieces will be passed and they won &apos;t be able to listen to a piece of double in this playlist . if the setting is active , the plays already played while observing the approach .
played pieces - this is the number of played pieces which are to be stored at the beginning of the playlist . thus you can easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces that are to be added after each played piece for play@@ lists . if you set here more than 1 , the playlist will continuously grow , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right side have been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialogue , you can choose from existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross several play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; random pieces from each of the play@@ back play@@ lists .
some scripts have their own settings . you can adjust settings by starting the script and then click on setup .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; -@@ scripts , by selecting on script . once you have installed the script , a new entry will be installed on the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the internet . do not use the button other scripts .
if you do not want to use a script for longer , you can delete it . simply select the script from the script and then click on un@@ install script .
if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please see the writing of scripts .
the dialog @-@ window visu@@ alization plug @-@ ins will be used for the activation of available visu@@ alis@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . to use a plugin , just activate the cross @-@ box next to the name .
this fast guide will show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps you can create an audio CD . to track the steps , you must have a running installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and a folder with audio files .
this is a dialogue window in which you can select which files you want to burn on CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD from MP3 s or other los@@ ely compressed formats , please remember that you &apos;ll get a bad quality at MP3 no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created by a los@@ sy format . use the project au@@ c@@ t@@ ect .
in this dialogue window you can do nothing . please wait until the calcul@@ ator has completed the burn .

norm@@ alize : this tool becomes useful for adju@@ sting the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , for example , to create the CD &apos;s and MP3 @-@ collections , for example , the different recording of the different albums can lead to the un@@ beautiful effect that the music pieces will be reproduced .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start playing from CD and automatically convert all videos to the base folder .
this is a convenient method , recently opened projects re@@ charge . the related sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on one entry opens the project .
saves the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new date .
save the current project under a new file name . KDE &apos;s Dialogue Save Target As appears with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would be able to Save for each individual project file .
includes the current project . if a project has changed and not yet stored , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; by what is to happen . you can then choose between saving and modifications . besides , you can also ab@@ ort and keep the project open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is asked for each non @-@ stored project asking what is to happen , just as if you were called for each project file .
includes all opened projects and termin@@ ates &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . for each non @-@ stored project will be asked what should be done so as if you have called a shot .
if you call this entry , you can select about the next dialog files to add to the project . this has the same effect when you select the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
opening the dialog &quot; Burn &quot; to the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialogue of the project . the only difference is the additional button of burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; to the burning of the medium . the burning dialogue can only be opened when the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is this ? help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . he anchor &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; files from a previous session to import the current project . this is useful when you are not used for a multi @-@ session CD . the data of the previous session will always be included , even if this feature is not used . it is intended for you to see that on the medium already existing files and folders .
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or Video DVD project . this function arran@@ ges &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . this feature does not remove files from the medium , it blind@@ ed only the previously imported files .
opens the CD @-@ copying dialogue . this allows even without a project file to create a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also only want to burn an image from a CD which you then eventually burn later on . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copying dialogue . this allows even without a project file to create a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also only convert an image of a DVD using copying dialogue . in addition , there is also the possibility of buying a DVD using copying dialogue is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the whole content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog to format@@ ting a DVD . this dialog allows you to format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing model and incre@@ mentally .
burns a previously encountered CD @-@ screen . the dialog requests you after a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file is currently not supported by pressing the burning button . ( ner@@ os * .n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , therefore you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously inherited DVD @-@ screen . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned down by pressing the burning button .
a previously exu@@ ber@@ ed DVD video can be converted . this dialogue window typically released after reading a DVD in the table view , but can also be all@@ fully used . it contains information about the rol@@ ment video , coding preferences and even options for changing the size and to cut black edges .
displays information about the occasional medium . this information is shown in the table view and includes properties of the medium , such as size and title @-@ length of CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ ing of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is crossed , a small box at the bottom of the window is displayed . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar has been hidden .
switch off the folder view or out . the folder view contains an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the table view is enabled , its content is displayed in the table view . CD / DVD drives have also a context menu with features such as media info , locking and locking of the run or extinction of the medium .
divi@@ des the table view or out . the content view allows to choose and pulling files into the proj@@ view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided a drive selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
switches the head @-@ list in the project view , or out . the head @-@ list is a nar@@ ro@@ wer area which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head view has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views .
this opens a dialogue window to change the key@@ code for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; but after you choose one of the commands available in the upper part , you can adjust the key@@ note order below .
this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; setup assistant . this allows you to enter the proper per@@ missions to the burning of CDs and DVDs . for this , system management rights are needed , so you need to enter the password for the system manager ( root ) when starting the assistant .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . here general images can be done . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work towards An@@ hi@@ ght . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and adjust the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , with a &amp; D tube . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality could be controlled by using a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; to use functions , you can either use the command line d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functionality , therefore more your taste and type of your task is crucial to what the included programs you give .
in this chapter we take note that you use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; to use functions , you must first make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; start a bit like the following at the console :
besides the general &amp; D &apos;s functions , all &amp; k@@ in ; -@@ program in common , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts that are described below .
the standard D@@ COP @-@ interface between &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions like copy@@ CD , format DVD and further functions for generating new projects .
D@@ COP@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video D@@ Project ( ) void of COP@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video D@@ v@@ d ( ) void format D@@ v@@ d ( ) void format D@@ v@@ d ( ) void or D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ XIII Project method , one gets a D@@ COP @-@ reference to the newly created project : D@@ COP@@ f ( K@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project received by # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project This reference is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above yellow K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which is only applicable on data @-@ projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string Par@@ ent ) void o Ur@@ l ( K@@ URL ur@@ l , Q@@ string Par@@ ent ) void remo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string junction ) void remo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string new@@ name ) void set@@ vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ string id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then adds files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT @ i@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ co@@ p cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ fol@@ dable / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p _ home / tru@@ eg / some@@ fi@@ le@@ .txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ les@@ bian for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it simply can be read audio CD ; it can be read and stored in MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the en@@ coder is installed on the machine .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the interface provided by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WA@@ V files on the hard disk ) and by many co@@ ders who have to be default for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and F@@ LA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ free compression ) . other codes can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD are stored and stored in WA@@ V files on the machine ( los@@ st@@ proof and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these WA@@ V files ( usually one per title ) compressed to the MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG format , or in other formats like the loss @-@ free F@@ LA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it must be done now .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ pre ( for O@@ GG ) or other coding already exist . all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distribution . however , only the coding packages are installed to be used . if for example F@@ LA@@ C is not used , the installation is also not required .
which code format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ ding Ko@@ di@@ ers gives a small introduction to ex@@ ter , audio quality and compres@@ sing factors .
a word on copying from protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to pick out the audio data from the &amp; CD . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device does not handle the protection , it is not possible to avoid protected audio CD ; simply do not use the mechanisms of the copying tools . simply avoid buying copies of copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only once has to be done ( the setup dialog can be called up to a suitable configuration ) , it will be explained before the daily handling of a &amp; CD . this leads to the hard drive for the slim neck of the user interface , about which you often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc . )
can &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB can get from the internet or can work completely without network , all that is manually recorded .
this is just a brief list of commands of the main window . on the page step by step there are further information on how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the thum@@ b tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .

opens the main dialog dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with various mapping cards ( like en@@ coder , for setting up the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter provides sound quality , coding and compression rates , and helps you to choose the right Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
if no audio information should be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is needed . besides F@@ LA@@ C there are also other like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the down@@ sides are the low compression rates and hardly any commercial devices that can reproduce these files .
among the audio formats , the information generated by data comp@@ ress according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG can have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower Bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate , the differences are less important since both Ko@@ di@@ ers produce very good audio quality .
o &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still delivered with most distri@@ butions free of charge but there are open license questions
+ high until very high pick@@ up quality ( with high Bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG , slightly deeper quality compared with lower Bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system , and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG does not exist .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special Auto @-@ stereo systems . today - at first 2009 - support these devices only the MP3 format .
a brief list of parameters for the audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for other parameters ) :
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces and has already quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 K@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 K@@ bps CB@@ R , compression rate approximately 5.5 . needs always 256 K@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a ti@@ el . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality .
&quot; -@@ h &apos;@@ = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R common stereo , compression rate is about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good Gen@@ u@@ g for music of young people , portable devices and auto@@ graphs systems . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps CB@@ R . this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without consideration to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; cd ; information that is manually entered or fet@@ ched by the program automatically from the free@@ DB database , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can be passed / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the coding programme to create the folder name and file name as well as the features of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program statements for the coding and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example , add the &amp; CD : title to the keywords ( English : day ) , when MP@@ 3@@ s are coded with l@@ ame , the switches must be trac@@ ed by l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = Kno@@ pf@@ be@@ designation in ass@@ istants ) :
that &apos;s what the free@@ DB is : a free database , able to read / enter the audio CD , so that all others can download this information instead of yourself into the calcul@@ ator . it is to note that here only the text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of pieces &amp; etc . , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ de@@ . of the U@@ e@@ ber@@ ator : that &apos;s the author meant ) I am not lawyer . so , nobody can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music enterprise can be inf@@ lic@@ ated wrong . all information can be done neither to the artist nor the music company . all information can be received in any case by a B@@ um@@ mel through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active to choose a cross @-@ section ( sending a address ) . for the use of free@@ DB can be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address specified in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the email address will not be used by the server ( This may only be the programmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; if the use of free@@ DB is set up , that ge@@ ographi@@ cally should be used on the next mirror &apos;s mirror . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org brings a current list of sp@@ ow@@ ders for the online call of &amp; cd ; information during reading a &amp; CD . alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( generally created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD in WA@@ V files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that will be used c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ; who wants to know more accurately , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD . s. please note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package should be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this has not yet happened .
for saving the loaded WA@@ V files the coding format can be chosen . by opening the file format for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and F@@ LA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free compres@@ sing for audio data ) on the tab . other co@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ fier package must be installed by the particular Linux distribution before the coding can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined code of coding . for more information on Ko@@ di@@ ers are located in the chapter of Ko@@ di@@ ers .
after installing a code , you can get more information about his switches , through the input of a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a con@@ sol@@ itary window ( eg ; console ) , which must be replaced by the name of the installed code .
this can have many causes . check the installation of the device drawing of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , which are typ@@ ing and read and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) installed . try both programs with a command line in a terminal screen . that could give an indication of what &apos;s wrong .
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD . please check the sleeve of the CD . this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with one step by step . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , everything understood , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example and you will get enough information to set up those areas that will make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time to set up everything and use our first &amp; CD . we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with an V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 K@@ bps for average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key@@ word ( tags ) .
it must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre@@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine because it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can do of course always .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is made and that you MUS@@ T own it ( eg ; by trying to copy something in with the par@@ ap@@ or ) .
the first section deals with basic setup of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; something that probably is done once and
the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD , which has to be repeated for any CD @-@ CD .
here we determine the compression coding for the compression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 K@@ bps ) . since we are lazy , we share the program containing the free@@ DB database to download the &amp; cd ; data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not be able to read it in any selection of a &amp; CD , once the matching settings are found .
the device @-@ drawing is passed to the reading programme , so that it can read the &amp; cd ; data / pieces can be read .
frequently / dev / CD@@ ROM is a symbolic link to the actual sound name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD . / DVD drive is available , it also helps a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existent records of the equipment for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the body card general settings . here you don &apos;t have much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything will be released / typ@@ ed as shown in the scre@@ enshot .
only in case of incomplete information will be selected , so you will be informed if information is missing from the key@@ word ( tags ) .
the flas@@ h@@ card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and allow the &amp; CD to automatically download the internet from a free@@ DB computer .
note : it has to be connected to the Internet during the reading of the &amp; CD , so that he can access the free@@ DB server to the free@@ DB server .
the second selection box is simpler , becomes a &amp; cd ; entry immediately starts reading the &amp; CD . this is changed with low risk , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the directory names / fil@@ en@@ dar@@ s , modify them easily and the ID@@ 3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
aside from this example is to keep in mind : if you want to manually enter it manually , then you disable the selection fields and free@@ DB will not use . however , this excess of 6@@ 20 MB is big , consider this twice if this is worthwhile to use . to free@@ DB in the Off@@ line feature , the two choices must be selected at least the first one . the mode is set up on the following map .
CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for data request , for retri@@ ev@@ ing the CD database ; information from the free@@ DB server about the Internet . how does the system know which data is to be obtained from the free@@ DB database ? read the section about free@@ DB . put everything as illustrated in the scre@@ enshot .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
&quot; &quot; &quot; CD@@ DB @-@ Server : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please go to the page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; page and look forward to a mirror server in your vicinity . however , this approach will work between the hosts . however , this attitude will work as a first attempt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both function equivalent to the server , as though many fire@@ walls have the protocol 88@@ 80 standard , maybe more happiness with the protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example we do not want a &amp; CD to transmit data to the free@@ DB server . the first deposit box should turn off .
simply take the settings from the scre@@ enshot . ( make sure the file / tmp is on your computer )
number of con@@ verse pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time are just an existing drive ? parallel reading and code ? the author doesn &apos;t know it so easy to try .
&quot; &quot; &quot; CD . after reading the final piece , then tick this to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the end of the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you cross this one , then / must be specified the path / folder in which the WA@@ V files are stored . if the box does not exist , the files in the private folder are created . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to do something with the WA@@ V files yourself .
all you enter as it is on the scre@@ enshot . the command is somewhat long , under circumstances you need to be brow@@ sed slightly to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio stereo systems sufficient . the resulting bit@@ rate is on average approximately 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of tags at version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3 &apos; Day for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of the tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest like in the scre@@ enshot . some comments for future use outside this example :
at the same time , number of WA@@ V files at the same time : when a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to code more than one WA@@ V file at the same time .
this is what we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as default for each reading of a &amp; CD . if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
in this section is described how the process of reading the &amp; CD . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk . first , a connection to the Internet is structured as we are comfortable and the &amp; cd ; data from the free@@ DB database is to be picked up . the process of which is described in this section is to be repeated for any release &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet included in free@@ DB , the screen photos see a little different from the data for@@ ested for a &amp; CD . therefore , you will learn the &amp; cd ; data manually insert them instead of removing them from the internet . comments will point to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; cd ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this hand@@ book .
if this is not yet to happen , then the &amp; CD now has to be defined , into the drive that has been defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as in the scre@@ enshot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD , can be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen , then you look for questions and answers following the help or go back to the previous section on the basic settings .
note : if the &amp; CD have been picked up successfully by the free@@ DB , all of the songs are already filled out already and the name of the artist and album are shown .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; there is a window bund@@ ling , and you can select a database item that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD .
if you do not have the cross @-@ box for automatic conversion of free@@ DB ( on page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but the data from the internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e @-@ step 02 : the CD @-@ editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD . according to the pattern on the next screen shot , you &apos;ll see the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Cur@@ rent &apos; , the remainder of the data in the input field &apos; record &apos; .
the artist must no longer be entered in the input field &apos; Cur@@ ren@@ feld &apos; , unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece .
the lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ v@@ ell per piece , the comment box of the album is used for comments that are valid for all the pieces of the CD .
attention : following the successful call of data from the free@@ DB database , the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor . however , it is always a good idea to start the content of the CD editor ( e.g. if all the words with upper@@ case letters start or not ... ) but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks .
note : in this example we use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ tags . this limited the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece , and only 28 characters for the commentary area . if you set ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed . this option is set on the tab@@ s tab ; take a look at the section &apos; base settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of generated files later with the tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . take a look at the work@@ erer in order to find more information .
simply select an entry that is obviously linked to the style of the in@@ ese CD . in this example , this is not important since we do not forward the &amp; cd ; for more information go to the web site of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example are found under rock .
after the choice of &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have seized for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . simply enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the titles of the &amp; CD .
note : this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB database . it is already sorted into one of these categories in the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are shown above the score list .
keep in mind that there &apos;s a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . only the titles that are marked so are read . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece , or pressing the button all pieces select at the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces at once .
was started by clicking the button select from the reading process , so this window appears for confirmation . click OK and then we &apos;ll take a look at the window with the orders and trace what happened .
click on the tab orders for switching on the order window . it is in the upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control orders . the first piece is read just onto the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message you can see if you &apos;re trying to work with a coding which you have not installed yet . pieces that have not been successfully coded using a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the tmp @-@ file and the target folder are not what we have entered here for example . did you check if you have writing access to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of reading the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus , reading and code simultaneously . note the status message in the bottom of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has found no configuration configuration to sup@@ press this behavior . the only thing that can be configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . with high @-@ performance machines , the result is unclear . the computer used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 appears to have no problem in simultaneous terms and code ( from however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is coded and a third order appears in the queue of the body . after the last piece is coded , a small window will end up with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; you need &amp; k@@ . 3.@@ x . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the coding of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; today is maintained within &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S as part of the Com@@ ult@@ i media package . however , most distri@@ butions contain already a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . if you read this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is aimed at individuals who compile from source files and are not intended for users who are using a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs if it is running , the following is for you :
one program retri@@ eves many different other programs has many variations of settings . best read the step by step for example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of different mapping cards and also includes comments for options that may not be used for example .
hello , always read on ? even if only the help menu after the first time the program was clicked , without any clue as it should go on from that somehow empty screen ( especially , when there is no audio CD in the drive ) , or from un@@ usually short menu ?
what is all about ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can not maintain this manual . it is considered the first version for a manual to add &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; who also always do something useful or change it , may it do . at least only after contacting the author . and if you read this , he did not leave this section and is therefore in agreement with this proposal .
strange , if you have succeeded in getting the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; then do not need these informations , but ...
&amp; C@@ mid , is the MID@@ I@@ - and Carav@@ ok@@ ers of &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others it has with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke and kar@@ a@@ oke echo@@ ing of texts also some properties , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI @-@ players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid , runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the OS@@ S system , so it should work on all systems with OS@@ S and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver , which is needed for the CIS . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequence .
&amp; C@@ mid ; displays the song text on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI @-@ channel through high@@ lighting the pressing keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you &apos;re in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from one &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window on cap can be drawn .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song@@ writing or text events ) . K@@ mid will automatically select the process used individually .
seat support . when you finish &amp; k@@ de ; during the play@@ back of a song , K@@ mid will start again with the same song again next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , a@@ we , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select ... from the menu File . it appears the usual file dialog , with which you can select the required song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid set . -@@ window drop . this also works with several songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and stu@@ d@@ ded the button play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry @-@ play from the menu item , or pressing the Sp@@ ac@@ button .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts when you draw it on the &amp; mid @-@ window . ( on several pieces , they are added to a collection and then re@@ played out . )
once &amp; k@@ mid , play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the controller .
if you find that a song is too fast or too slow down , you can click the arrows on the left and to the right of the temp@@ o and thus change the play@@ back speed . to get back to the original speed , double click the tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the Sp@@ ac@@ eb@@ ar has two tasks : when a play is played , a pressure on the space is causing a pressure on the button break or selecting the menu entry in the menu item , thus interrup@@ ts the play@@ back . pressing the space @-@ button during no play will start , launches &amp; k@@ mid ; reproduction .
lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use text events , others use lyrics and again others both . some pieces have no text at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set what events are to be displayed and even better : the er@@ ign@@ ist@@ type is automatically used to activate a song , so you don &apos;t have to set anything manually in the menu settings , but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to specify a type of er@@ ign@@ it type , select from the menu settings the file pointer and issu@@ s . the same function also have keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you summar@@ ize . these are lining up in the row . in this section stands how you can use collections effectively .
to create a collection , open first the collection manager . to find this in the menu Collection under the point Organ@@ ise .... Click here on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will be included in the beginning the same songs as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the desired volume .
in the temporary collection you will reach all the songs that you want to not add to any other collection .
when leaving the application this collection is not stored . concern you that when you add lots of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song with the button to add a song . it again appears the file dialog , with whose help you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the attitude of automatic execution to the collection .
when automatic packs to the collection is enabled , a piece of opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) automatically added to the active collection .
when Autom@@ atically is not enabled for the collection , by opening a piece of the temporary collection , the temporary collection will be activated and sign@@ alized . this collection will then be added the further opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on Dele@@ te .
you can select the order in which the songs are played out . if you select the row from the sub@@ menu flas@@ hing of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or choose to choose random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text .
to jump a song , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu item , or press the button arrow to the right .
to jump back a song , select the button previous piece , the entry previous piece from the menu item , or press the button arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection manager , choose the collection and click the button Dele@@ te .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this plays no role as it is not stored when leaving &amp; c@@ mid ; not saved .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers who are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case the MIDI @-@ map general @-@ MIDI events are translated into events that syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers the syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ map , which conver@@ ts all events of the change Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the change Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et , and thus always carries a trumpet , if originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound card , you do not need MIDI @-@ map because all sound cards are GM -@@ compatible ( inc@@ l a@@ we - and CIS cards , FM @-@ devices and so on ) .
there are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps , so you need to edit the corresponding file from hand ( using your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file , which stores all necessary re@@ ali@@ zations for the playing of a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . but a prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text id ( see below ) .
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; name of the Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a paragraph is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section the patches of General MIDI are shown on your specific keyboard . general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the equal sign will be ignored . it is assumed that GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also have no line for any of the 128 instruments .
the optional U@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all notes that this instrument requires to put on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard , for example , can take a hurri@@ cane ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which is similar to a gun . therefore , you enter the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
so if a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 ( rif@@ le ) , it takes a patch 100 ( the drums on your keyboard ) and sets the sound 60 , irrespective of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here is a patch on the patch with the term &quot; drum patch ( drum , tank , Mar@@ acas &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the sound means the sound @-@ height of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to specify how sounds are shown on a particular channel or instrument .
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the order of the lines is very important , as well as its presence . so you need to create 128 entries .
you can define several keyboard maps for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are mainly needed to set off tones on the per@@ k channel . look at the key@@ maps for example .
this section can be used to sc@@ rolling some channels to others . if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel , you can easily do it in CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however these settings are useful for key@@ boards that have percussion on a certain channel ( general MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices require 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
n is the channel shown on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map will naturally need to be defined in the file ! if you are using the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events are ignored , which try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , then becoming more patch x used .
the For@@ ce@@ patch can be useful for example to always use the per@@ ky patch on the site @-@ on channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der@@ og@@ o will be multip@@ lied , in which relationship Pit@@ ch @-@ ben@@ der events multip@@ lied by the value n , this will be applied with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only then transmitted . the value 40@@ 96 is used , so that the Map file is not a dec@@ imal number .
this setting is needed because GM is needed that a keyboard that is intended to play a pitch using 40@@ 96 , a sound higher . unfortunately , try some key@@ boards to play two notes up to an oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you must try a bit &apos; grip . &apos; ro@@ de &apos; .
to use a MIDI @-@ map , just open the dialog MIDI settings . this can be found in the menu below settings , point MIDI settings
the can@@ al@@ view is a window with a whole bunch of cla@@ vi@@ atures ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ vi@@ als you see which sounds are just playing .
you can also use the can@@ al@@ view to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel there is a list of options where you can choose an instrument , lights the button no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument will be used .
the can@@ al@@ view has ( up to now ) two different views to view the played notes . the view select from the menu settings below the point can@@ view : settings
the speed @-@ LCD displays the speed with which a song is playing . the higher the number , the higher the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . so if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that has to be played on how a music@@ piece has to be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc . . this can lead the same MIDI file to two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians play the same banknotes in very different ways .
good , I can comp@@ el anyone , &amp; C@@ mid ; to use . but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you get a similar sound quality . at a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a fri@@ lls ( r@@ pm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without a@@ we support was compiled . to remove the problem you need to download and install an immediate distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s home )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection but I do not want to add all files individually .
do so , endorse &amp; k@@ mid , drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , choose all the files and drag them to the &amp; mid ; window .
select first necessarily the setting of automatic add to the collection . otherwise , the files are added to a temporary collection .
you can click the arrow @-@ button on the left of the tem@@ po@@ - LCD device to slow down the play@@ back . to restore the standard temp@@ o you can double click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ working space a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or I &apos;d like to play a file , only in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window change and the desired file into the window by &amp; k@@ mid ; pull .
if you only want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , turn off the automatic add to the collection , and the new one file is added to a temporary collection . opening files
let &apos;s suppose you have the MIDI files A@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ A.@@ D. First you only want to play the first file , so make the setting of automatic packs to the collection and open A.@@ D. your temporary collection contains exactly this a MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid , and to create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , they anim@@ ates me , to program &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a ( Spain ) . I do not have much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time . as Hob@@ bies I have programming , MIDI files , making music and prove things .
if you would like to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ a@@ oke files if you want to have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; have , or even if you want to make me simply happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ ver@@ .@@ es
you really want to send me a huge pleasure to send me a postcard from your place or a MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file ( if you want this ) . before you want to send me a MIDI file , but you should contact me , as I might have the file .
I &apos;ve written &amp; k@@ mid ; fully written in my spare time and threw it by anybody for this . I want to stress that I just get more programming , because / if I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wai and Joseph H. stages - Beh@@ ind the error that the pitch @-@ height was too high at a@@ we cards .
my thanks also to Jose L@@ us San@@ chez for the testing of the CIS support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Magn@@ us pepper , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ er , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , a bug , or even a supported email .
and of course , my thanks also to all those outstanding musicians in the net , which give us these wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ mid - can be found on his homepage , which is located under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ ver@@ .@@ es / ~ R@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , information look and pictures look . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc .
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , because sound quality depends much on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same if you use a FM device or a a@@ we card .
if you don &apos;t have sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VI@@ SU@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear any music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send a fault @-@ informed directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ player , ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used for play@@ back video files of the M@@ player or Ph@@ on@@ on formats , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD &apos;s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; has not yet been finished than &amp; k@@ in ; on this computer was installed .
for additional help please check the KDE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list .
the application window is made of so called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that is only displayed when information is displayed in it .
it is possible to save the favorite links below the book@@ mark menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries , which are played by each other , you should use the category of permanent playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to find an extra hierarchy . if you make an entry , his group and all his sub@@ groups are copied to the current category and play@@ back begins with the printed entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and permanent playlist can also be changed by direc@@ ting editing of the XML configuration files . of course , one can only do that when &amp; k@@ m@@ player / / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / , can also be changed by an editor , but also by applying the menu view . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this section will appear .
after changing XML files , you have to choose from the menu the same with playlist , and either chosen mode selected , or chosen another category .
all changes are lost when the mode of employment is left or another group is selected without the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some features can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c and change from &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 &apos; option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be simply inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ / / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ ver@@ .@@ k@@ / / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation at the starting hand does not need to be short , it is automatically cancelled due to opening another source . however , this would end with the end @-@ animation , however , the user can end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the ads of a favourite photos : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ ts ; &amp; / / / / / / / sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gif ; / sm@@ il@@ ts ; in the source package of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are in the directory testing / some examples of SM@@ IL that are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player .
there is a rider to configure the M@@ player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player . here , the path of the M@@ player and the intermediate storage size of the dat@@ ac@@ ro@@ ms can be set out of the network and other things .
another tool for debu@@ gging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player inten@@ tional .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured using manual editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ / / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c , as the setting up of the back@@ end by mim@@ e@@ ype . here is an example of a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa :
&quot; Flash &quot; can be played inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted in the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
so that the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages may be able to reproduce the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as service provider for the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ type ( / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the interior dialog file to KDE ) .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is to be started in a consoles application and search for error messages related to loading your browser &apos;s library . the stolen process is cr@@ p@@ player . if there are no mistakes , the back@@ end edition is inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) .
so always a given back@@ end for a certain M@@ IM@@ E type is taken ( of course only if this was obtained also ) , this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ gu@@ c . for example phon@@ on should convert all logged files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be looked , the scanner that can be used to be used and the TV channels can be used manually or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( Video data Rek@@ order ) settings in k@@ m@@ player is the dialogue within the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there , ports should be detected by which a code should be found ( e.g. , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B contained in it .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player only use X@@ Video ( probably this type of recording of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ con@@ lin@@ ux expansion will be operational for the X server . therefore , for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server , it must contain the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally , by KM@@ player for the sources used different names . at the time of creation of this documentation , this dv@@ disaster source , intro@@ sp@@ es@@ ource , scanner source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ ex@@ source . if enabled , start playing with the play@@ back of the playlist .
are there any indications as I can make my CD@@ ROM drive , if I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ E 8 / dev / CD@@ ROM is run as user root after recording the device . it is absolutely sure to make sure / dev / CD@@ ROM drive to the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts only slowly , why does each time my CPU needs to be checked for their performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player will automatically need the final stored value , only the first time will check the CPU .

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for the creation of graphical user surfaces and network support , and becomes the compile of &amp; ki@@ le ; needed .
l@@ atex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems is likely to have resor@@ ted to the package &amp; text live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the software used &amp; Linux . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD / DVD should be used .
the &amp; ki@@ le ; -@@ project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions allow easy installation without further compile and included on the ki@@ le ; website .
this manual is for everyone - independent of the experiences with &amp; l@@ atex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , the support for this project or its documentation is required , the contact about the ki@@ le ; the website should be made .
if questions come to or with the compile from &amp; ki@@ le ; or if extensions are desired , this should be addressed on the mailing list of ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ environment for use of all &amp; l@@ atex ; features in a graphical interface and within this a simple , immediate and customized access to all &amp; l@@ atex ; programmes . furthermore , the opportunity to complete , compile and error tools for this . finally called , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management .
to find out more about &amp; Kate ; and his possibilities to experiment should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of &amp; Kate ;

finally here only a good news alert to &amp; l@@ atex ; given , it is not the ultimate book for this . um &amp; l@@ atex ; correctly to master , good lead , e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ AL@@ Y , A Guide to &amp; l@@ atex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r .
just like other mark@@ ers , includes &amp; l@@ atex ; an introduction to be specified with the general characteristics as paper format , side numbers , and text numbers , as well as a c@@ issu@@ ance with the text . the introduction includes at least the command \ \ &apos; class , the number begins with the command \ \ &apos; { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ &apos; { document } .
the fast @-@ ascent assistant of &amp; ki@@ le ; is an extra function for the quick creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; the selection of the assistant ( menu ) provides some possibilities for the preparation of the document . you can also add some documents related to the document .
document type : this will be the type of document used to be desired : articles ( article ) , book &#91; letter &#93; , article &#91; writing &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ amer &#93; , fo@@ ils &#91; re@@ amer &#93; , fo@@ ils &#91; pro@@ men@@ ers &#93; , or custom .
code : it is hereby set the strings of the system . modern systems increasingly use UT@@ F @-@ 8 enco@@ ding as standard . at best , UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ x should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list provides the most commonly used add @-@ on packages for &amp; l@@ atex ; . for involving them only in the cross @-@ box they are dealt with .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , Articles ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the Docum@@ entation in Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( in compliance with German DIN ) . they should always be used when creating German texts .
new users now don &apos;t worry . it is a brief description of the functions and more detailed information about this in the section .
&amp; ki@@ le ; - as well as other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; ki@@ le ; a simple problem search is not closed . you should not notice it through the modest appearance of output file . however , you will save it through the modest appearance of output file . however , it will be saving you time and sensation .
with automatic rel@@ inqu@@ ishment of environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ , { Command } ) of &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically a blank page ( for input the text ) and the corresponding line to the left of the command ( e.g. \ \ , { Command } ) . this function can be disabled in the menu ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are de@@ activated .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; l@@ atex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most interesting and subtle item ) :
when we view the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a single mouse click .
when creating your own &amp; l@@ atex ; files can be very helpful in creating your own &amp; l@@ atex ; once a DV@@ I ; -@@ file &#93; was created &amp; ki@@ le ; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DV@@ I ; observer for corresponding line in the &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ source code .
a DV@@ I ; file contained a description of the format document and other information such as the font type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; . there are lots of tools for viewing , conversion and printing of DV@@ I ; files for different systems and items .
if you use the R@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ts@@ he@@ ets the elements of the DV@@ I ; file has been shortened to an element in the DV@@ I file . -@@ source code is the exact opposite of it . once on a section in the &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ source code has been clicked , becomes the corresponding position in the DV@@ I ; observer notes .
master document : this function is used in working with multiple files . with a master document , work is simplified with other .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project goals .
fast : the &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ source code is compiled and the result automatically displays ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
file watch@@ making : in this mode , the DV@@ I ; -@@ file on large inhi@@ bited â a@@ es@@ â a@@ es@@ â a@@ es@@ - and there is no appeal by &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; after the quick @-@ building .
in case of viewing the editing tool , the three large selection fields are conceived . the selection fields were designed for the quick rec@@ eding of common elements into the document . the first selection box is for the fast breakdown of the document in parts , sections , sections , ... The sub@@ folder &amp; l@@ atex ; commands given for the sub@@ division :
the drop @-@ field Fur@@ ther is for the addition of articles such as tags , fox or references . the available possibilities are :
name : with this command a name for a section , an image or other element is created .
cover : is used for a reference to a specified name ( selection relating to a selection ) .
during the quote of quote , a selection list with literary influ@@ x is shown . for &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are corresponding editors . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last drop @-@ field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ le is used for defining the font , for the main text , the fox @-@ notes etc . , there are the following writers :
when calling &amp; ki@@ le ; two choices are available : 1 . the assistant to create a new document by selecting the document type and laying down settings . 2 . the document may be written from scratch .
the brack@@ ets after the command \ \ &apos; class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; lays down the font . the font is not set at the beginning , this may also happen in the text .
once the above source code is typ@@ ed , the &amp; l@@ atex must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is the use of the metal building or of a but@@ cher &apos;s expres@@ sive .
the source code must be stored prior to the compile . &amp; ki@@ le ; for storage the storage is automatically exp@@ ired .
permits the comp@@ iling of the document , should be searched in the recording after the faults . when using quick @-@ installation , &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce should be started . this is not the case , it should also be considered by logging .
an environment ( English ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font 12 are created and only a few hours . the command \ &apos; begin using environment } , \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ HU@@ GE
the changes are only in the surroundings ( \ \ &apos; begin using environment } to \ \ ( environment } ) . there is no resolution ( number ) for the settlement in an environment .
there are many possibilities for obtaining the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . there can , for example , certain type of fon@@ ts , gre@@ ase , cou@@ pl@@ ings , sub@@ missions , etc . , are added either with the command \ \ \ or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ { begin } : this command is for the course of course and is closed until it is closed with a \ \ \ &apos; { &apos; } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be presented with \ \ &apos; per word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ by { quote } .
after the background to the writing of the source with the &amp; l@@ atex ; excer@@ pts were presented now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step instructions for creating a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; .
once the assistant got some text to be entered , a few adjustments for better read@@ ability of the document should be performed . therefore , a quote , a few places in the fat and cur@@ sive pressure and a poem to apply to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , an editor or tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , the window must be closed .
once the DV@@ I file has been created , the document may be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and Spa@@ des .
DV@@ I ; is a crucial file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice i n@@ utes ) . these files are produced by &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi @-@ output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screen .
for the printing of a &amp; DV@@ I ; file is the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . when clicking on DV@@ I , the document may be printed by a file printing ( in the observer ) ( provided the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar provides the conversion of the DV@@ I ; file into other formats . once the DV@@ I ; file was created from the l@@ atex ; -@@ source code , the conversion can begin to log in to other formats using the button bar .
the preview of a direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DV@@ I ; file .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ binary files . here only Modern is to be set up under settings ki@@ le ... tools used .
to look for the for@@ estry , the mouse @-@ cursor must be positioned in a line of the source text and fell asleep on pre@@ views . the jump to the corresponding location in the DV@@ I . -@@ viewer takes place .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; a click of the middle mouse button in the DV@@ I ; document the appropriate &amp; l@@ atex ; document of &amp; ki@@ le ; in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ le ; in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; as text editor you have to set ( settings O@@ ularline ... editor )
if by using rapid delivery of the &amp; DV@@ I ; -@@ viewer : if there is an error , it should be a mistake , it will display in the log file or in the message window .
the log file declares the error source in the source code . in the editor you can always click on the error that the error occu@@ red . in order to view the error message . to view the error message , must be clicked on the error in the log file and &amp; ki@@ le ; jump to faul@@ ty line .
once the appropriate button in the tool@@ bar is clicked , a window will appear to choose the template used for the document . the template features are :
when selecting single document , a document can be written from scratch or used for the quick creation of a new document . further information is included in the section .
seven users of &amp; l@@ atex ; usually use the same introduction for nearly all documents . templates are able in &amp; ki@@ le ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / l@@ atex ; file is opened or a new file is created . &amp; ki@@ le ; a new template can create a new template using a document and a selection of file templates .
when creating a new document from a file by a file , some string of strings may be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or string coding ) . these variables can be set up in settings Ki@@ le ... settings gener@@ als .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is used to enter the document class . typically , it will be used as a document type : \ \ by Class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the assistant and thus for the commands given by the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps have been completed :
when creating a new document , your custom template instead of the standard may be consumed .
a template can be created from any number of l@@ atex ; files are created an easy way to create a template , search for one on the web and the steps described below are required .
&amp; ki@@ le ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor of many different types of text@@ books ( including &amp; l@@ atex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for example &amp; Kate ; can be made in the menu tools directly from &amp; ki@@ le ; ) .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and his lust to experience the manual for Kate dre@@ ad . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; were able to start working directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of &amp; Kate ;
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers a very practical and l@@ atex ; -@@ command reference , which can be called for the help of La@@ Te@@ X reference . it gives an optional description of virtually all commands , which can be found in &amp; l@@ atex ; use can be used as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ click with paved C@@ tr@@ l button to specify the tex ; word meaning . this means that in this way by clicking \ \ par \ &apos; \ by \ \ par \ \ par .
when writing the text with penetr@@ ated left mouse button , the text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board automatically .
when using the arrow buttons with penetr@@ ating Shift key , parts of the source codes can be washed out in the editing window .
&amp; ki@@ le ; has the opportunity to browse all kinds of source texts and to emphas@@ ise them . for example , the &amp; l@@ atex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ul@@ ae are highlighted by another color .
many ass@@ istants can pick up an extra spr@@ ite . this is a separate type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu item allows the jump to the next or final jump . also this spr@@ ing@@ mark is highlighted , so that during the first input of a sign are automatically extracted .
mach@@ ining is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; ki@@ le ; but despite Kate ; important functions were added to writing a &amp; l@@ atex ; important functions for writing a &amp; l@@ atex ; special commands given their choice . in editing , the following commands may include the text selection :
w@@ akes a complete paragraph ( group of lines that appear on both sides an empty line ) . with a paragraph is not meant to have a text with a single line ( as in other text editor ) . these advanced meanings also slept with tables , &amp; l@@ atex ; commands and all other lines of source text . the only prev@@ ent@@ ative thing in &amp; ki@@ le ; is thus that the demo@@ lition are separated by two blank lines .
is the word given under the current cur@@ sor@@ position . this choice also has an advanced meaning as this command also l@@ atex ; -@@ commands with a wide range ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
for example , by a part of the document it can be washed out of this first and by wir@@ ing the key un@@ f . &amp; Kate ; offers the ke@@ yp@@ ole C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers its own commands to include faster mo@@ tility . among mach@@ ining are the following commands included in the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; ki@@ le ; is contained in the description of editing volumes .
it has already been demonstrated that environments play a central role in &amp; l@@ atex ; therefore , &amp; ki@@ le ; for additional commands , include editing , easy work with &amp; l@@ atex ; .
this command will j@@ umped into the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to the foot of the surrounding area .
this command will j@@ umped into the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the left end of the surroundings .
if the cursor is before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } is at the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many inde@@ b@@ ted environments , this command can quickly get lost . this command simply slept in the surrounding area , so that the inter@@ ming@@ led ambient structure is not cr@@ acked .
&amp; ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; l@@ atex ; groups that are determined by br@@ aces { ... } . taking the Te@@ X @-@ group are a few important commands that correspond to those from mach@@ ining environment .
this command is j@@ umped into the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the straight cl@@ amp .
with this command will spr@@ umped towards the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed just behind the curved cl@@ amp .
if the cursor is before or behind the curved cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , the other end of the group is j@@ umped ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many disgu@@ ised groups @-@ cl@@ as@@ ps , groups brack@@ ets can be lost soon . this command fell upon the last set , so that the we@@ ather@@ ed structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed .
in &amp; l@@ atex ; two simple instructions are used as a tool for use . for the purpose of suitable implementation will be used in &amp; ki@@ le ; the sign &apos; used for two simple application marks . &amp; ki@@ le ; he knows this case and for two asleep list@@ ings for further &amp; l@@ atex ; one .
this automatic inser@@ ting of the double room for the plate can be set up under settings ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X - and will be left out .
there are also number @-@ specific settings ( such as n@@ german or French ) and thus German or fran@@ k speakers can be used . there are also many other languages available .
in the case of Shift ; input taste , &amp; ki@@ le ; a smart line @-@ break . if the current position is located within a lists of lists ( such as enumer@@ ates or item@@ ize ) , not only a line @-@ break but at the same time the command \ \ item .
within a tables surrounding we slept &amp; ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an attached new@@ line break down .
even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ et &amp; l@@ atex ; - or custom environments to be supported . these can be asked under settings ki@@ le ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables ( amp ; ) and all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; ki@@ le ; try to increase this . by the drama of Shift ; old ; amp ; searches for &amp; ki@@ le ; after the n@@ est t@@ ulator in the current line , for the columns of the current Tab@@ ulators .
although &amp; Kate ; already having a good source code completion , these two modes ( mostly for &amp; l@@ atex ; ) is still expanded . there are three different modes as needed , and the other two are available for automatic adjustment . all of these modes can be set up for different working conditions under settings Ki@@ le ... complete .
at start a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ \ environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) added .
with the last character of the R@@ Ã ¼ ders , the last letter is removed and seems to be confused by the aband@@ on@@ ment list . on the other hand , the list can also reduce the list by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions can be taken up by &amp; ki@@ le ; alternatively , jumping mat may also be considered , so that a simply jump to these positions can be viewed by mach@@ in jumping mat &apos;s sky@@ line and the aforementioned parameters can be considered .
under settings ki@@ le ; set up ... ki@@ le ; promises number of options can be made on these lists . there can be different types of wine lists for &amp; tex ; - und &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ commands and was@@ ps of the general language used .
the command mode is for completion of environments . there are always a few letters with \ &apos; begin typ@@ ed and the call of the completion mode will have been used a large list with ambient adjustment . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for completion of environments to improve .
when calling the full @-@ tone storage space , the command adap@@ ts to the surrounding area , or the key@@ boards of the environment is automatically frozen and it appears \ \ begin { . after this , the environment will continue completed and by the type of input will be stopped .
once it is accomplished , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; ki@@ le ; realize that it is a lists environment , is even being considered a first \ \ item command .
under settings ki@@ le ; set up ... ki@@ le ; promises ; default options may be made on these lists . this mode uses the possibility of locking @-@ in mode for &amp; tex ; - und &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; ki@@ le ; supports user @-@ defined lists of depar@@ tures , which can immediately set up via sound strings ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ sions . as an example of a listing list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the letter L is entered and the word comple@@ mentary passes over the menu operating spra@@ yer + Alt spaces , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
large roofs are not helpful for automatic re@@ plac@@ ements , but has been found that many calves in a document are written more than once . thus , &amp; ki@@ le ; the completion of all already written .
this mode can be set up in the menu structure Ki@@ le ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ fully painted . here also the Corpor@@ a value can be specified for the display of the promises .
installation files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ / / share / apps / ti@@ le / complete / mode / day &apos;s Home folder . dres@@ ser is available for des@@ par@@ ation ( termin@@ ations ) , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ end@@ book ) or tex .
the dialog &apos;s graphics are designed to form graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of graphic formats , the sections should be considered and he@@ eded .
PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but they offer an excellent foundation for all changes and re@@ arrangement of pages . the PDF output can be repaired , so you can restart the pages with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; press tools and then convert into a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf file .
to be able to watch the results of the work , the source code must be compiled . all components are group@@ ed in the menu of creating compact , Cre@@ ating converting and generating views .
for the compile of the source tool for spect@@ ator such as &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; or the additional conversion can be used to key@@ boards by means of old ; 3 , by old ; 4 of the DV@@ I ; file is converted to a PS file and by means of old ; 5 the PS file may be viewed .
when using the instruction manual , it is usually called a spect@@ ator after the comp@@ iling . should not be used in a ser@@ pent@@ ine viewer , each new window will be opened each time .
a new project will host the project &apos;s new project .... here the following information is asked for the project :
when the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ ki@@ lep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; ki@@ le ; allows the exec@@ uting of EC@@ MA@@ Script -@@ Ko@@ de . the scripts can be managed in the vertical track .
the API @-@ scripts is not yet sophisticated and can be found in other versions of &amp; ki@@ le ; still available .
first I must say that the running environment of the scripts in &amp; ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = ki@@ le ) with the following methods :
l@@ atex ; is a rather sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of useful packages . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different kind assistance to support the user .

due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tual ; delivered , the finding of the correct document is not always easy . as best assistance provides &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tual ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k sent a database with all to &amp; ki@@ le ; delivered by a graphical table .
all documents are divided into categories and the best advantage is the search for package names or tags . from &amp; ki@@ le ; then only the results are displayed .

the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; itself may have little to do . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality instantly and do not have to wait until someone is used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be used . more about it further down .
to install a plugin or a K@@ itty , we begin with the menu Plugins Edit . this means that the following dialogue is opened :
this dialog allows to manage all the plug@@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . adding plug @-@ ins without a storage location was used &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to find the plug @-@ in .
many people often work on a project in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nickname and serves to clear identification .
one member may have multiple roles in the project , such as both team@@ leader and sub@@ project leaders .
the user can select itself from the list of members of the team member who he is . this happens by transl@@ ating the team member from the list and the Button has expressed as expressed . the currently selected member ( their identity ) will be f@@ ett after you are : text .
nickname and attitudes of one &apos;s own identity are important with regard to messages and notes . see for more information about notes .
besides giving an overview of their team , there is a further benefit by collecting members of the team : it can be an event created for information to the team@@ leader if something particular occurs . see for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something particular happens in the project . an example would be the drawing of opening and closing of the project , so that later someone can be seen or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that file a file in CV@@ S , once they are added to the project &amp; etc .
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings for dialogue can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the address selected in the recipient list . the addres@@ see can be a team team or sub@@ project leader . see in , we@@ i will be set up such leaders .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
how to give comments is easy . it can either choose the editor entry from the editor @-@ right @-@ menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keywords used in a commentary volume followed by a feature text .
remarks can be sent to a identifiable member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( roll ) , taking nickname of the inserted nickname sub@@ project manager After the tyre and sub@@ project leaders should be given the corresponding tyre or sub@@ project names , as described in the following examples below .
nickname and roll @-@ names are independent of large or small @-@ case letters , but spaces around the br@@ aces and the : make the note invali@@ d .
&amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages , which is D@@ T@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic and web@@ based formations and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
the settings are accessible via the settings menu . here are only more &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found .
the settings can be set up by means of settings Qu@@ anta . this dialog extends over some pages that are treated in succession .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; concerning tags , including car communication , can thus be changed . the entries are :
large / small @-@ case of tags : large / ax@@ ing of automatically bearing tags . normal Groß / Klein@@ wort means the tags are as inserted as they are described in the tag XML files .
large / small @-@ case of attributes : large / to@@ wer@@ case of automatically in@@ fi@@ ed attributes . normal Groß / Klein@@ wort means , the attributes are described as described in the tag XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if requested , is optional for tags for which the final day is optional , this immediately after the bed ; added .
do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags except for simple tags .
starting and end @-@ tag automatically update : when enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic transmis@@ sions of acc@@ ent signs : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the appropriate coding during wr@@ apping .
M@@ IM@@ E types : Mim@@ e@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . using the standard standard can be restored the default past@@ es can be restored .
standard Dia enco@@ ding : coding of newly created or in other way than with file opening files ( where the coding of the file may be passed ) . however , this setting will be released from the same in the project lists , if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ T@@ D : the selected D@@ T@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ T@@ D was not recognized . however , this setting will be released from the same in the project lists , if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; created regular backup copies , so that with a blackout or crash at the next start of the program the document can be restored from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . also for not stored documents will be a backup regularly , according to the time provided .
the preview and documentation can be displayed in the editing area or in one &apos;s view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to look at the documentation , the preview and the source code at the same time .
set the shut@@ down settings back to the next start is useful when the user interface through modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depending on views have been mess@@ ed up . it corresponds to the --@@ @-@ layout line @-@ line parameter .
the warning messages are also serving the taxes of the possibility to off@@ end the message from warnings to An@@ ha@@ ken from no more .
the place surrounding the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change . it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the sync behaviour of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code view in the shared mode . see the different modes see .
here the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the illustration of the par@@ ser @-@ no@@ des in the document , can be set in detail .
in the click of the struc@@ t @-@ click on the structural tree , the following action makes it possible to change the dissolved action by clicking the structural tree with the mouse @-@ slip action .
in the structural @-@ tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree can be automatically opened when editing and how deep during a change of the structural tree will be automatically opened , blank lines are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such , where there is no element in the current document .
the area to create short@@ cuts ( a type of templates ) which are un@@ folded in editing to extensive text . abbrevi@@ ations are valid for groups , each one may be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means it can give a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ us@@ ac@@ ron@@ ym means something different than in a group valid for Javascript .
here , the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug@@ ins are part of third @-@ applications from third page , which can be re @-@ used by any wedge @-@ capable application , most known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following are to be stated :
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not located at a stand@@ ar@@ place like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
input : this information is passed to the plug @-@ in at the start , so it can open the current file , the right folder ( path of the current file ) or the folder folder .
component in the &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in is denied the store . only @-@ L@@ ese K@@ Plus@@ Parts does not typically refuse the store when this option is not chosen .
check the plugin : is this activated , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , whether the checked information is correct . choose the entry also , if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the debu@@ gger was made completely new . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) debu@@ gger was set , as well as support for the db@@ g debu@@ gger . instead of this , a debu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept has been implemented , which enables various implement@@ ations about plug@@ ins .
currently , only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ants .
the use of the debu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable debu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the button options next to the Debug@@ ger @-@ plugin selection box , the specific settings may be changed .
if a debu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; interface :
a view in which the content of monitoring variables is shown . appears normally in the left dock .
a view in which all holding points are listed , with line numbers and conditions listed . normally , appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the debu@@ gger ( as shown in HTML ) of the debu@@ gger is usually displayed in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the debu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
this action makes the connection to the debu@@ gger , if necessary , or it shares the plug @-@ in with a debu@@ gger . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which needs a debu@@ gger , so that normally does not need to be respected .
the counter@@ part of debu@@ gging session Star@@ ted the session . closes the connection to the debu@@ gger or ends the l@@ ump to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server for a de@@ bug requirement . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to look at the current document . the issue of this requirement will be displayed in the debu@@ gger issue .
indicates the debu@@ gger , with the execution of the script and to send information on the monitoring variables as well as the current line @-@ to @-@ date . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution continues . happens before a debit request was started , the script starts with the request .
indicates the debu@@ gger , with the execution of the script to start when a script is stopped , the execution continues . happens before a debit request was given , the execution starts as soon as a request is put .
the debu@@ gger is conducting the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or any includes .
the debu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script , whereby if possible in functions and includes faul@@ ty .
indicates the debu@@ gger to move the instruction and go to the next one , as if there would be the current one .
opens a dialog , in which a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the over@@ saw value appears in the variation view .
this dialog can be entered into an variable or set a new value of a variable .

this chapter tells you how you can be &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to suit your needs , and how you can help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; help you get better .
document@@ ate Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are offered in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to give support for marke@@ ters and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; give us &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; easy , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; a quick , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script files and the tool@@ bar . tag Fol@@ ders contain two file types , the tag folder and tool@@ bar ; and Tag@@ XML files contain hand @-@ based legends like the Edi@@ tier window ) , which em@@ bedding text and instructions faster to a document than a user may ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be manually created ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing D@@ T@@ D . see for details on the conversion .
this document describes how to create x@@ XML files then the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ ing . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of Fe@@ atur@@ es@@ di@@ alo@@ ve , the &amp; Qu@@ ir@@ crip@@ tion@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; file formats permit a quick inser@@ ting of tags in a document without a risk of writing .
tag folder are nothing but a folder . they contain only the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag directory carry the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declare whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible , so other users may have better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is set out in a simple way .
this is the root element of a day document . it can only happen once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only one element type above itself nothing else .
the type of tags is a script function . when using it , att@@ r &gt; an argument of function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the conference class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for the type of meth@@ od applies . gives the name of the class to where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a purchase attri@@ but@@ or and the attributes inside this tags can be added to each other day . ( family 1 )
sets a text into dialogue . this text is determined by the &apos; s ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
describe an attribute of a tags . this item can only happen once for any attribute . it puts the name and the type of the attribute . in addition , it contains further tags , which shall be indicated , as this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc . this is a only element type .
is the source of the source codes used for the attributes in the day @-@ Edi@@ ting dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used for reaching the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p methodology within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; will be used to reach the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a methodology . the arguments to be handed over to the method . may be empty or % tag , which means the name of the current tags .
a container @-@ tag that group@@ ed the elements of a list . it may occur for one attribute only once . it is a only element type element .
sets the position of the attribute of a tags within a dialogue . this day may occur for each attribute in a dialogue only once ( e.g. once for each time ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the item is empty .
returns the position and the size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in the dialog once ( e.g. one for each time ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; day ) . this item is empty .
specify a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this item is a only element type .
specify a list of elements that end a day . this item is a only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; De@@ gree : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 En@@ coding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly gre@@ ased and closed .
spaces affect nothing , but watch out &amp; amp ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaces all . this will make no leg change , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to verify the Tag@@ XML files , the tools Dialog up in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to start the window and check the top X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , the inspection occurs only when charging the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
in the following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes this , diagram &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . the file name for these Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ atic .
in the following an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the file name of these Tag@@ XML file is supposed to be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; - XML version = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &gt; S &gt; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type _ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor that can be processed via D@@ T@@ D and D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly introduced &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; an easy &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c should be created :
&#91; general &#93; Version = I use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; D = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ T@@ D / / / D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ T@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not indicated , the name will be used as Nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... created . click New Action leads to the same dialogue :
this action has been assigned a short@@ cut . by clicking the button user , a keyboard short@@ cut can be assigned to ; With K@@ one the current short@@ cut is removed .
the simplest actions . it can be entered a text in the detailed settings , and in the execution of the action , this text will be inserted in the document on the current C@@ ursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful shareholder structure . with the help of this action , external applications can be started ( usually scrip@@ ting , but on it it is not limited ) , which will change the document or give as input ( or parts of the document ) ; even the quick start @-@ in dialogue or the various See in ... promotions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first of all , the name of the script and interpre@@ ters can be specified . example : S@@ H / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ ting variable in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable which can be used in the command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name .
% pi@@ d : will serve with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if there is of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text will give unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ COP is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the listed methods , a script entry of &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to the standard input can be determined , what is to be sent to standard input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected range of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually useful only with this setting .
according to the input data , the output of the completed application can be diver@@ ted . there are two types of output , written on the standard copy ; error messages , indicated on the standard error . it can be specified what to happen with the text written on the default output by putting the value the drop @-@ down output :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups . it is necessary for each group to create their own tool@@ bar . in case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the mark@@ up .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add actions and configure . select Settings actions .
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . pressing the New Action Kno@@ pf@@ es at the bottom of the window will start editing mode .
simply complete all the necessary fields and add it to the right tool@@ bar .
complete everything and , in case the day attributes have and you plan to use their use , enable you to edit a dialogue of day when available , so that you can enter the action possible when using this action .
Ig@@ itt ! is that an ugly symbol . who should notice the action in conjunction with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulties .
to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , graphic other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses standard 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select the size of others .
please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to that the day start , I have decided to create a kno@@ b as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually interpreted as los , rigi@@ dly , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user sign@@ aled , that att@@ aching this symbol a &amp; lt ; start@@ led , tag in the current document is to be added .
after creating the symbol it must be associated with the action . this happens via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . in addition to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the use button and continue using other tags , so there are , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ et@@ ap@@ lus ; features to the tool@@ bar or it should be divided into a better overview by some separ@@ ators in multiple groups . set the tool@@ bar to set about settings tool . make sure the tool@@ bar is selected .
I would like to select the Tren@@ to ( only left above ) for my tool@@ bar . after the selection of the module , which is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow @-@ button to the right . this adds the tool@@ bar to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I want a quick way to get access to the par@@ ap@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note how Tren@@ to support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar , could believe that the &amp; quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start kno@@ b .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested using all icons to ensure that everything works .
secure in the correct folder . after rest@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be saved in the right folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust their &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) when a file is opened by the appropriate type .
perhaps the most notable enlargement of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language that you like most . therefore , describing this chapter as I have a &amp; PHP ; document tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you might be in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; repository repository , if someone has done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you need to search a existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc . language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part we will leave you , the second we deal here .
# KDE Con@@ figuration File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Section 2 = # Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Section 2 = # Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html = Sec@@ ure@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ .@@ html 1 = dedicated 2.@@ html 1 = ordinary 2.@@ html 1 = tag@@ 2.@@ html 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation file . for example , you can see the documentation in PHP &amp; PHP . documentation such as :
# KDE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Content , # Test@@ ing Star@@ ted = Ten@@ tion@@ .@@ html ... Language Re@@ ference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Re@@ ference . that shows that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there &apos;s no known border for the chess loop ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash , but try it yourself .
you notice that the contents are refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequ@@ ential at the top end of the tree review &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing , but watch out &amp; ... signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resources are replaced .
the contents section is the range of the do@@ cr@@ c file which is to be shown to the design of the context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script creates the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . by flag@@ ging the function name and pressures of C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context help the documentation would be shown directly . there are only two types of entries here : the Con@@ text list ( Con@@ text list ) and the file lists .
a simple list of separated context elements that are to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c simply save on $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ / / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as stated in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c , and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that these are well and worth it to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation we were using to the &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ repository for the use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the sh@@ re@@ movable resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool @-@ tools , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or anyone else . at different places there is an email to send menu @-@ mail , such as D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripts tree .
resources can be up@@ loaded to our main archive , from where all the others will be able to download it . the contributions are checked and only available when our team need it as accurate and used for publication . to obtain a useful contribution , we recommend the resources to signing that there is a GP@@ G / P@@ GP key . thus , the source of the resources is ensured , both for our team and for later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for their private GP@@ G keys ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the event you have multiple key , you can choose one out . in the dialog new resource , the input fields must be filled out ( URL preview can stay empty ) and click OK the upload button .
up@@ loading can upload from the D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool @-@ bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree will begin .
after downloading a resource , nor prior to installation , examines &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by testing the integrity and signature . in case of problems , it may then be canc@@ eled . please notice the warning messages carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource correctly signed , a message appears with the specification of the origin@@ ator of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages that is currently not supported by &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be necessary in tag@@ XML format . there is the easiest way to convert a D@@ T@@ D automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ T@@ D shop and Con@@ vert D@@ T@@ D menu . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the D@@ T@@ D description that should be used . after that , the following dialogue appears :
target directory : the newly introduced &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .

tuning the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; following the transformation of the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand this and draw full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this chapter is trying to give them exactly these concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; little benefit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the working area is divided into three ranges : global , local and proj@@ ect@@ related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available for everyone , who is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , available . from tool@@ ing about actions it is all that is selected as globally in the joint folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this allows the group of administrators to secure tools , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ ing . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; pattern up to tool@@ ing with special actions taken specifically for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most limited size . all elements are dis@@ car@@ ded in the folder tree of the project , making the sharing of special tools and patterns by all employees within the project .
the &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some major areas : the editing window , the edi@@ ts , the cri@@ es with information and the tool@@ chain . please suggest , and for further information on these areas .
you can click the driver &apos;s rider with the right mouse button , to get a right @-@ click menu with the current document chosen entries , such as close the current , other , or all the un@@ part riders , newly loading , delete or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right click in the editing area lead to another context menu regarding the edited document contents ( cut / paste / paste ) , processing of the tags , using the mouse on the mouse , or opening the file , when the string is referred to a file under the mouse cursor .
at the top of the Edi@@ tors there are the tool@@ ing of the editor . currently , &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of machine tools is demonstrated . in the course of further training of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bar will be adapted to the new features and associated users needs .
the use of tool@@ ing is really easy . if they want to insert in a simple day , then click on the icon that represents the day . now , you can insert the data for this just tag . should you want to insert the multiple attributes ( like anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the buildings ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , to open and wander . in the presentation with car@@ ap@@ ots are available for files , project , model templates , scripts , scripts and documentation prints .
project management is a powerful tool to make &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view displays all the files in the project and allows the administrator of files in the project using the right mouse click . promotions such as adding , removal , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from storage media can then be carried out with the right @-@ click menu .
another option of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . nearly everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all possibilities open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on how they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the global templates are always available , local templates are only usable for the corresponding users and templates . more to templates is available in templates .
here you will find information on the available scripts . the concept of mer@@ gers in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can call the available information on a script . on the right mouse button , additional features are available , such as the script to start or send with email .
in this view one shows the internal structure of the active document . through links @-@ clicking of a module , the cursor in the document is set to the position of the element . through the right @-@ click of a module , a list of commands opens with regard to navigation and refres@@ her the tree .
this tree appears under the other sub @-@ views . with it can change quickly attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . that on the content exclusive use system allows the change of all available attributes with just a few clicks .
here is the complete documentation for the web technology for your development . there can be pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; document site can create , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited , edited and considered .
by default , &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two car@@ o @-@ riders at the bottom of the window , about the beneficial information can be obtained : the news window and the problem window .
this driver pad provides information on each in the Qu@@ anta Flash script . thus , for example , the D@@ T@@ D on the current document and any changes used to D@@ T@@ D are displayed .
this driver pad provides all errors in the current document . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ scripts that will be executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool @-@ contractors are comprehen@@ sively extended and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate table of the tool@@ bar is the ability to make their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to define .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar via e @-@ mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , sends the tool@@ bar as a comp@@ uted T@@ ar archive across &amp; k@@ mail ; if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can give them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , as any other secure and load !
it &apos;s reasonable if you want to adjust the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; instead , auto@@ conf file has a number of options to get to the configure script . / configure --@@ help one . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems when starting from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 am a folder . also , you should ensure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H before your bin folder . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the KDE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for a rapid web development and combined a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; -@@ Editor , the developers started at &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; what would be if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exten@@ sible Mark@@ up languages would be ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer confined to pure &amp; HTML , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ize : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then you should be &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to be the appropriate &amp; IDE .
now , to the above claim has to be held that &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows in good application of free software , the idea of why someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ not ; -@@ Sc@@ st is not only all possible but allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity almost every task . by means of com@@ itted actions , scripts and tool systems , automation will increase almost every task . by doing so , they can increase &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , without any need to notice any scripts of scrip@@ ting tax . ( more about them can be found in . )
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web development environment designed for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development and quickly expanded to a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in detail documentation is compatible with help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter or k@@ help@@ center help : / qu@@ anta carry out ) .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; is currently developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ inch sequ@@ el @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you opened . this list changes every@@ time when you open a file which is not in it , being the oldest entry .
this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use . should you try in the section above templates . should they try to save the selected file / Text outside of the local / project folder , only a mistake will be reported .
conver@@ ts in inser@@ tion from the cli@@ p@@ board there are special signs to &amp; HTML , so that they may be correctly indicated and not mis@@ understood by the browser as a form assignment .
conver@@ ts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL : type , which is the correct way to inser@@ ting special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . in the first instance to add &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor day .
switches the block@@ ages on or out . this allows you to choose text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
goes directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages are out !
seek a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined out@@ press to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the ad of scripts and the debu@@ gger .
initial and switching of the problem comes at the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main re@@ porter is activated once you switch to the structure tree .
displays the tool@@ bar left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with one click .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu with the entries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previous or next &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the position of the killer in the document . &quot; &quot; &quot;
book@@ marks from other featured documents will be group@@ ed in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of other documents .
opens a existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects are stored with the file revers@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to include files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
searched for the project directory according to new files they could be there . that allows e.g. to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
load the files in your project on the server high . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slave ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project is managed . in the chapter &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you will find the details of the project .
download a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in Project @-@ tool@@ bar and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be stored by means of setting actions ... You will be stored via tool@@ bar or you will be asked when you want to save the tool@@ bar .
remove a tool@@ bar from the lens . it does not delete it from hard disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar , you are asked if you want to do so .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to das &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Team , in order to make the tool@@ bar in the next publication ) . the menu item opens a new email message using the tool@@ bar as attachment .
allows to upload tool to the main server , where anyone else can access it . see in .
load a &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; that you or anyone else did , and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
loading / refresh the ends of the &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; it makes sense when the entities of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refres@@ hed without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a ty@@ pe@@ er in the global KDE folder does not exist , fails to load .
this menu contains a list of tags available in the current tool@@ bar code . if the standard ( HTML , ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day setup dialog , if there is one . this entry is always available in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ men@@ ues .
activated or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ ting of tags . currently this does only work with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the inser@@ tion by tool@@ bar denied if this day is contradic@@ ted to the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the above @-@ mentioned menu list . click on them . click on a activated plug @-@ in de@@ activated .
select the Syn@@ dro@@ c@@ tional mode for the current file . the list of available herd @-@ shell schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
select the type of line identi@@ fier . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ intosh .
checks the syntax of the document on the basis of selected &amp; D@@ T@@ D , using the external application of the tidy .
instant switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the KDE libraries , the switching sometimes need time or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the body card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which matches the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . by selecting a single command , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
spl@@ its the status of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main fish@@ ers at or off .
the changes in this dialog is influenced by any application using the K@@ HTML Part , including the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ browser .
see the behavior of the Edi@@ tors Day . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you can find details .
a dialog appears , in which you delete entries from the tool@@ box , or which can add or change the sequences .
this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse cursor , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with every open source project developers can always use help . if they wish to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled in top from top to bottom , e.g. after filling the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be completed later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project properties are set .
here is the name for the project to give , for example fo@@ o . in the input of name it is automatically filled out .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension of web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can find the server address of the machine to which you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ Ex@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.0.@@ 1 ) are possible .
lets this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol may be used . depending on the placement of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder in which the tool@@ bar can be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bar . when a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows files to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or whole folders can be selected .
this setting is great when you have static content which one wants to download and change . if ser@@ ver@@ ted scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP , Python , &amp; etc . ) you have to do differently .
in@@ stit@@ ching , if files , that are located somewhere in the root folder of the project , are to be included . if a project is already started again , not an@@ ha@@ ken .
this option will display all files and folders within the main folder and you can make a precise choice of vou@@ chers .
this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by an@@ ha@@ k@@ ken or , by removing the h@@ ooks , sp@@ amm@@ ing out of the project .
the last screen of the new project ass@@ istants contains three settings that simplify your work . you can upload these settings in the menu with project features in the menu profile or modified with the short@@ cut Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project ass@@ istants and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( wild@@ card possible ) to be ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additionally option to top , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when opening the project . in can read more about project views .
thus , the desired debu@@ gger may be selected . currently , only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed can be found in . the debu@@ gger plugin can be set with the button options . in this , the debu@@ gger may be described .
in the sub@@ window profiles , upload profiles can be set ( see in ) , as well as the display of a tree @-@ view for the content of the server for each profile , showing an own construction view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list , see the details .
in the sub@@ window configuration , you can turn event action and add these actions , change or delete these actions . event actions are executed when a previously specific event occurs , such as the Si@@ ghts of a file . see into the details .
by default , &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project , which was opened . this behavior could not currently affect .
to open a different project , select a project to open project ... from the menu project or the icon project opening out of the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows selection of a project .
when &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , changed files . same happens when you load a new project .
project construction gives free access to files in the project . there the files in the current project can be managed .
folder behave equally , but missing the file opening and opening with ... in with the right mouse button @-@ click context menu :
here , various profiles can be selected . the profile contains information about the location of the up@@ loaded files . see .
allows removal of current profile . if only more a profile is available , the button will be cancelled to prevent the removal .
the password will keep in the core memory and be forgotten at program@@ ing . this possibility is useful when most common up@@ loading files is needed and the rather in@@ secure password can be stored on the record -@@ option does not come into question .
that will stop transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high la@@ ven@@ de@@ profiles have been created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) will be up@@ loaded on different servers . editing or creating a profile will be shown in this dialog :
this is the name of the server on which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified dom@@ a@@ inn@@ ame or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed Ki@@ o Sla@@ ves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP , file ( local ) and NFS .
the port for the transfer . usually this does not have to be changed unless the network administrator operates a service not on the usual port .
depending on your anxiety wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a risk . use them at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so it can not be read easily , but everyone with programming experience can easily be seen in the plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ ing . it can give a lot of views in a project , i.e. by simple exchange views , various files and tools can be loaded and replace current files and tool@@ ing .
views can be stored or deleted in the File or Project tool@@ bar , accessible or deleted from settings tool @-@ tool@@ bar .
this section describes the parts of &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has to do most . this helps not only improve productivity , but also allows the adjustment of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to our own working method .
as mentioned above , Tool@@ bars are in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best to make the tool tool@@ bar . use and adding will be different in the section &quot; Add of tool@@ ing . &quot;
the tool@@ bar and the symbols can be set either using the right @-@ click menu ( right click the tool@@ bar ) , in which with New Action , remove a new tool@@ bar , remove other actions like tool@@ bar , which can be stated in dialogue where actions on this or other tool@@ bar can be visible .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , additional entries will be removed and action dealt with , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bar and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tool ... and set settings actions .
templates are supplied in essential documents , code sni@@ p and files for short@@ cuts . we can copy , move or link each at the system existing directory in the template @-@ tree . templates have been in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you imagine for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; included conditions for their use . please read the conditions set out at the beginning of each template used exactly .
Bin@@ ar is all what is not pure text . it can be any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are usually inserted in documents using short@@ cuts ( such as pictures with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are available in the template tree under global templates . further information on the templates tree is available .
documents can be created from any text document . based on these templates , new documents can be created . normally , a simple rum@@ ors for the purpose and organising the work in appropriate ways to be efficient . some examples can be found in the pre @-@ tree under global templates .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template , but the same text field has to be inserted over again into the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a fin@@ note down to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl . some examples are in the template @-@ tree under global templates . read in for more information on the templates .
as the name says , these templates are used for whole sites as templates . they are a collection of different documents organized in a folder structure , and there is currently no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
design a document structure to Bel@@ i@@ eben ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select file as a template storage as a local template .
once that has happened , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a project position ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look in the preliminary tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As a template . alternatively , you can simply save the selection as a local / project folder . alternatively , the selection can be deduc@@ ted simply by pulling and desc@@ endant on the commands .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a repository folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as pulling and dra@@ fting or inser@@ ting the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
in file tree , you can click on a folder on the right and select Site template , submit a name for the template and secure it . by default , the project folder is backed up , but of course , it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented pre @-@ way procedure . you can make head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or dynam@@ ically with PHP ; shape , add files or connect with them . in addition , you can keep some of the things while using templates in projects very profound .
the template @-@ structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files presented in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ / / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of vessels as explained above .
to set the behavior of a folder , in the pre @-@ view view , click on the folder and select the context menu features . the following dialogue appears :
a drop @-@ down with the three types earlier ; files , text or templates . this selection is dis@@ band@@ ed as soon as el@@ ter@@ ous attributes have been damaged .
this is enabled by default , and fit for everything except the trunk . if a root folder it would be dis@@ abling , unless they would appear explicitly . in the case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text @-@ Bau@@ stein . if nothing appears , one is probably in a root folder .
permitted or set text for templates in this folder . this could be general header and foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows copying of contents into a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate header @-@ lines .
in addition , you have a right @-@ click menu ( pointing the right mouse button ) for a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and paste from templates from one place to another .
&amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that are accessible via the View menu . the first mode will replace the editing window in two parts : the code Editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cursor . then you can edit and switch if required to source code editor , in which the changes performed in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor on a document that incorpor@@ ates &amp; PHP ; -@@ source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; it is still necessary to modify the source code editor . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that simultaneously changing the changes both in the source code and in V@@ PL ; editor activated . with pressures of F@@ 9 this mode is already active , the key pressure from a window to another , where the position in the document is maintained .
the sync position between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code Editor is adjustable using settings Qu@@ anta allow you to choose between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in the selection , you can automatically set the time period . basically , the recommendation is valid for fast machine and a large margin for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website so tool document properties can choose . thus , the editing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called once a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor created . this will serve the suspension of the fil@@ thy code . this allows you to change the following :
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. s@@ words for Internet search engines . met@@ a items can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons located below or removed . one click into the list allows modification of content , e.g. keywords in column name and key@@ word keywords key@@ word on the content column .
CSS @-@ rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS @-@ rules with the buttons on the list . a change over the list is possible as with the Met@@ a elements . editing of CSS @-@ rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to insert an external CSS @-@ style , by pressing on the file @-@ open button and select the appropriate file .
the use of the cur@@ sors is possible like in a word processing , through loading with the arrows , possible . in rare circumstances the mark@@ er acts as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and del@@ eting with or del@@ eting or dele@@ tion .
inser@@ ting tags is made in the same way via tool@@ ing , as in the source code Editor , it is to note that inser@@ ting tags previously available already existing identical tags , e.g. when a anchor @-@ day , surrounded by text , everyone must be removed from the same anchor drops .
some tool @-@ tools such as the tables assistant or the lists @-@ assistant are disabled . you will later in &amp; V@@ PL ; work in this release will need to make the tables or lists tool@@ box .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for checking still@@ s . in contrast to other programs for still@@ s , the search for certain elements is possible and the performance of the style can be tr@@ acked .
to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , need except &amp; k@@ de ; nor the libraries li@@ b@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ bex@@ change and li@@ b@@ x@@ ml , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ .
content in a template , in one point from x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g @-@ packed style or x@@ ml file or at the current no@@ de . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in the g@@ db @-@ Com@@ pati@@ bility mode can be set in a specified file and line number , and will be activated later .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g det@@ ects the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without p@@ ad@@ anus . file names installed in the same folder as the very up@@ loaded one point to the work@@ folder ( x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ) , for example , a sty@@ list file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , is the following entry possible :
in this command , in a partial or whole agreement with a pre @-@ age called QNAP ME or a specified model name . &amp; eg . template agrees with every QNAP ME , that contains the string template .

there are many graphical tools for comparisons . so why &amp; nbsp ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
the merger was very complicated , because one of the contributors had made many changes and simultaneously had been corrected in many places the rec@@ ir@@ ation had been corrected . another programmer had altered lots of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts associated with it .
the program used by me only showed me the changed rows , but I could not see what exactly was changed inside these lines . and there were no indications of the places where perhaps the rec@@ ir@@ ation had changed . that brought about this change was a small nightmare .
so this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could be differences within one line and changes to white signs . later , a lot of other useful features were added .
if you want to compare , for example , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparative windows .
a function which did a lot of work , was the comparing and merge of folders . this function changed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
also 3 @-@ way together will be fully supported . this is useful when two persons are working independently from each other on a piece of code , and make changes . the co @-@ operation editor under the differences . in this editor you can even editing the result . in this editor you can even edit the outcome directly . the scre@@ enshot shows three Qu@@ ell files together :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you also in the same and merge complete folder . this scre@@ enshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in a folder @-@ containing :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and serve them according to the possibilities of today &apos;s colour monitors . if you frequently need to review Ko@@ de , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and t@@ abl@@ ers are shown visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white signs , one can see that on a look at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no trouble anymore when someone changes the file recovery . )
if a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file differently is different . red color indicates that both files differ .
if all the files have the same name , but in different folders , you can easily make ti@@ p@@ par@@ ture by writing only the fil@@ en@@ ames of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 folder @-@ folder
the Open @-@ Dialog allows to type file type , select a file via the file server ( file ... ) or selecting a last updated file from the list . open dialog notice your choice and display them next time . you do not have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be executed .
via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the same or merge version is introduced . if for A file is selected , for B and C , however , a folder , then used &amp; co@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ames from A in the two other folders .
if mer@@ ges is enabled , the input field becomes active and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily required to set a output file . you can also finish this step later on .
the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting with the same / match .
sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; # diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text pieces from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparative window . the comparison then begins immediately . in Open @-@ dialog you do not have to select any files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also drag and cast off : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
which idea is behind it ? sometimes a file contains such similar functions . if you want to find out how similar to these functions are , this would be a relatively big effort . you would only have to create two corresponding files , they in &amp; co@@ diff@@ 3 ; now you can copy the relevant sections simply copy , insert and then compare .
note : currently you can choose nothing of &amp; glue ; only the pit@@ falls of text in a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors will interpret the pulling and dra@@ gging of text into another program as ex@@ iting and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text window there is the info @-@ line . the info @-@ line of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) E@@ ach info @-@ line has a different color . ( when the path to a file is too long , you leave the mouse a while above the line . then a small help window will display the full name . )
the three source columns are the letters A , B and C characters . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these preferences can be changed over the settings menu ) .
when a difference is recognized , one sees in the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s the next section ( merge ) to see good .
links next to the text is the summar@@ ize column . when differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages , the color shows on . in some programming languages , where white characters are not as important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.g. , white characters are relevant only in strings and comments , for the processor and in a few , rare individual cases . )
the vertical line that separates the summar@@ izing column of the text is interrupted by the points , where the respective source file has no lines . if the line is activated , the line will be displayed on the broken lines .
the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the journal output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; ... &#93; if you &apos;ve processed the result . usually , it includes automatic combined text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , the storing is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons jump to next sight / un@@ solved conflict in order to find remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference simultaneously is a conflict that must be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the first line of the group in all windows is marked and the first line of the group is shown . ( this will also be a jump of the position in the windows that the start of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group becomes the current group . it is highlighted with the color wall@@ paint for current area and each on the left appears a black beams .
sometimes the automatic pack leaves or has no other line left in the group ; then it is only a space for the case that you change your mind and maybe choose another source . this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a mark@@ er which you might copy and insert elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; signing @-@ in ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function .
note : if you are choosing the sources , ignore options or ignore ignore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
navig@@ ating , navig@@ ating mainly with the image of the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the window , you can use the arrow buttons on the right , bottom , end , Str@@ g @-@ beginning and Str@@ g end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs .
in the course window , you can also use the other buttons on editing . with the inser@@ ting button you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ writing mode . ( default is the plug @-@ in mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ ies columns will synchron@@ ize the view of all windows to the start of each group ( as already in the section ) and the edi@@ table display window was explained .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Picture A@@ way ) or the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Picture A@@ way ) or to the next / previous conflict ( see below ) . therefore , between resolved and un@@ solved conflicts will be differentiated .
to copy the mark@@ er into the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to press the Cop@@ y -@@ button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l @-@ inser@@ tion ) . if this option is activated , whatever you mark , automatically re@@ copy to the cli@@ p@@ board and manual the manual slot . be careful with this option , as you could re@@ write the content of the cli@@ p@@ board accidentally .
po@@ stage will be saved according to the underlying operating system . Unix @-@ versions use a line @-@ up characters \ , and Win@@ 32 @-@ based systems use car back@@ wards + new@@ line \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 keeps the display of the source files not , therefore you should use &amp; co@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using bin@@ aries .
the options and list of the last used files will be automatically saved when editing , and restored when the next start . ( menu installation - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 set up ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog provides writings with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
when you activate this option , differences are displayed in recur@@ sive script . if the chosen scrip@@ ture does not support this representation does not happen at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colour , some colors could not be available in its pure form , but would be ast@@ ered . on these systems the button settings automatically displays an un@@ just color .
if enabled , it is inserted by pressing the Tab@@ ulator button the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator is inserted .
if you input or return , the file returns will be automatically used for the next line .
when enabled , each range is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . you just copy the manual into the cli@@ p@@ board then .
you can select which type of line type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the used operating system .
when comparing files are tried &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all identical lines will be found in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white characters are not ignored . also , white characters are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a jack @-@ string &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others usually save a sign @-@ sign &apos; \ &apos; . if enabled , files are visible with different sizes in the side @-@ side comparison , though they are different . if this option is enabled , the car mark may be treated . however , this option must be de@@ activated . if this option is de@@ activated , this option is disabled .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis , figures and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) ignored . in the result , the differences are still indicated , but they are treated like white characters .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . changes in comments are treated like changes in white signs .
intensive after even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very big files .
in Autom@@ atic res@@ sing mode , this attitude determines how long the outcome of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is ongoing .
sol@@ der automatic all conflicts in white characters can be less important by selecting the chosen file as a source . if you need this only from time to time , then better use the functions UN@@ le A / B / C for all un@@ solved white conflicts in numbers or comments , if the options ignore numbers or ignore ignore C / C + + comments .
these options are treated in the chapter on sc@@ anning and carrying out a compilation . look for details under documentation for the directory comparison and interaction .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version is attached to the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such a back@@ end file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g exist , it will be deleted without further backup .
adapting the language of the interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you must finish and restart the change , so that the change is active . ( this option is set in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language there is over the Control Centre ) .
the following codes can be adjusted separately for each entry . if this option is activated , the upper setting is used for all entries .
the selection fields for coding appears a short hint of what the local coding is . ( this can not be modified here and has an informal character for you . )
adjust the file enco@@ ding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpre@@ ting . as the coding for each file can be individually adjusted , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can choose which coding should be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ fabri@@ cation command , you might not be able to function 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code ) but the pre @-@ editor command can only be associated with 8 @-@ bit AS@@ C@@ II . ) With this option it is possible to specify the coding of the issuing of pre@@ fabri@@ cation instructions .
disable this to sup@@ press sli@@ ces of changes in white characters in the text or review column . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options are to ignore or ignore ( ignore C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode all differences are displayed in a color@@ full swing column . but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files . depending on the choice of A &amp; b ; C , A &amp; B ; C , C or B &amp; b ; C is indicated beside the normal nor a second over@@ see column with the required information .
sometimes you &apos;d like to use the space available on the screen for long lines . simply finish the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
select the same window by side or cross each other . this can also be useful for viewing long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you regard the differences and then decide to bring the files together . the current file merge in the merge menu also works if you only compare two files . a simple click starts the assemb@@ lance and use the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as default file . ( if this function is used to restart it , then the name of the last used file will be maintained . )
when reading a file , it will be handed over to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that suits your claims . you can use this function for example cut disrup@@ tive parts or to correct the file re@@ charge .
when reading a file it is specified first by this external order ( see above ) , then the output of command is the input of this pre @-@ processing command . you can write your own pre@@ processor that is exactly your requirements . each entry line needs to have an associated edition line .
the thought behind this is to allow the user more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program requires , and most users want to program that not self . however , the good news is that , in most cases , sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this pre @-@ editor command to convert the input to upper case letters : sed &apos; s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; . * is a erg@@ ul@@ ary expression based on each string . \ \ 1 in the sub@@ set string refers to the found text in the first round of string . \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in upper case letters .

while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and perhaps like this regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is well suited for example for another pre @-@ machine command for po@@ p . sed it / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 6@@ 78@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach characters between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hand is replaced with nothing , so quasi er@@ ased .
sometimes you might want to perform multiple compositions on one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions . example :
instead of sed you can also use something different such as per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ p -@@ p / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / switches &apos; However , for per@@ l some details are different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are maintained to display and keep it up . further operations only change the data that is viewed in line @-@ up al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre @-@ processor , the version number is the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the proc@@ processor command commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences hidden , you can &apos;t notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often , programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively and merge .
... makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal from the start ,
... can sim@@ ulate this and shows the sim@@ ulated changes without having to really carry out ,
... results selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is similar to the con@@ verse and merge individual files very similar . you only need to open a folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three files are merged , then folder 1 will be used as a base . if no target folder has been specified , uses &amp; co@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts . to restart it , you have to select the appropriate menu entry or push the F@@ 7 key . ( further details follow . )
during reading the folder , you will find a small news window about the current progress . if you cancel the sc@@ anning of the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared to that .
when sc@@ anning the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side ...
each file and each folder has been found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded up . you can double @-@ click a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object or using the arrow buttons for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub@@ directories and all sub@@ directories , with which you can open all the folders and folders .
if you click on a file , the file will start straight and it appears a comparison window .
the symbol in column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( a ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details window to the selected object . in such a case the plug @-@ in action cannot be automatically elected . if this will be put together , you will be informed about the problems of this type .
as seen in the above picture , the colors A / B / C are the colors red , green , yellow and black used .
with identical inser@@ tion , the color is also identical , even though the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical when their entire content is identical . then you have a folder the same color . for folders , the age is insignificant for its color .
the idea to this color scheme is based on marine diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf@@ let , which is only green , then yellow becomes red and later , if it is old , red .
... A and C are identical but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , it cannot be started .
... A and B does not have the same type of file ( such as a folder and B a file is ) : error : contradic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , it cannot be started .
the mode to sync is active if only two folder and no explicit target folder were specified and if the option directories are active . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for a entry ...
... A and B exist , but are not identical : merge and the result is stored into both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; directly after the output is copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are put together and select the option new file instead of inter@@ sec@@ ting ( uns@@ afe ) , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the exact date appears , but the exact date appears , then the exact date appears , but the date is identical .. Whi@@ le such mistakes are not removed , this can &apos;t be started the folder .
during this , one file will be processed after another . you status column displays Finish one , if that &apos;s comp@@ lied successfully , and according to other reports , when something unexpected came up . if that collap@@ sed , you should make a final review and check if the status is all right .
if chosen the file method of exec@@ uting the file method , K@@ diff@@ 3 more columns will display . these contain the number of un@@ solved , sol@@ dered , not wh@@ iter and White conflicts . ( the column for dissolved conflicts will only be displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can merge either the currently selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) or all entries at once . if you have selected all the plug @-@ in actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can merge this together .
please note : if you haven &apos;t specified any target folder , then in the three @-@ folder mode C is used as the target , in the two folder @-@ folder , B is chosen as the target and is used as a target and is used as a target for sync , A and / or B serves as a target .
if you selected a target folder , please check if all entries should be in the target folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options caused by certain entries to be ski@@ pped . check these options to avoid un@@ loving surprises :
to run all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to only run the current entry : select action of the current item , or press F@@ 6 .
if due to the conflic@@ ting types there are still invali@@ d actions , a message appears that indicates the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid promotion for them .
when you bring all entries together , a dialogue window will appear with the options running , sim@@ ulate and abor@@ ting .
select Sim@@ ulation when you want to see what would happen without the real changes done . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is needed ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window will pop up ( keep the scre@@ enshot ) .
when you finish with a file , select again directory / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved , a corresponding dialogue will appear . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; to make a mistake , appears a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you &apos;ll see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem ( F@@ 7 key ) , lets you choose to choose another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before you continue with the problem .
if some entries were individually combined , notes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and leads them later together . even if this has been merged or not stored , these entries are considered to be done . only when you change the merge action , these entries will again be merged .
the settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called Directory bond with these options :
only files that fit on the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . you can separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( eg * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default setting is * . folders must not correspond to this pattern .
files and folders that correspond to these patterns will not appear in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that correspond to these patterns will not appear in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that are also ignored by CV@@ S . many self @-@ written files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder can be submitted to an .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( take a look at info : / CV@@ S / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems files have a default attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems you have a previous score . this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is switched on in default .
when links to files : if the option is off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links show . this is down@@ lighted in the default .
with left to folder : if the option is switched on , the links will be treated as normal folder and recur@@ sively op@@ tically . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible recur@@ ren@@ ditions check out . a link to a folder that would contain a link on your self would result in an End@@ less grinding and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ) This option is switched off in default .
introduces a complete analysis of each file and shows the statistics columns . ( the number of dissolved , un@@ solved , non @-@ white and white conflict ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and considerably slower when applied to files that contain no text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern ) .
if you compare a large folder over a slow network , it &apos;s possibly faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speeds will cost you a certain level of safety . please be using caution . this option is reduced in default .
it doesn &apos;t take any real comparison . the files are considered as identical when they are equal to each other . this may be useful when copying the chan@@ ger Date . please be used with caution . this option is reduced in default .
activate the sync mode if two folders are compared and no target folder has been specified . in this mode , the proposals to merge will be identical . also the results from the merge files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default .
if there are differences , instead , instead , the copying of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is considered unclear because the other file is not also changed . you should check this in any case . ) This option is off in default .
if a file or directory is replaced by another or deleted , then the original version gets ren@@ amed and gets the extension .@@ original .@@ If an old backup file has already exists . this also affects the normal merge individual files , not only that merge whole folder . this option is switched on in default .
normally the folder @-@ merge view remains visible to the merge individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want , you can switch the option list &amp; text window to switch to the window menu and switch between directory &amp; text windows between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking here . however , you can add a single file directly from the tape menu . once you save the result , the status will be done automatically and the file will not be combined again if you start the folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , this status will be lost when you re @-@ read the directory again : list of the directory : &quot; &quot; &quot;
KDE supports network transparent with the aid of K@@ IO slave . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folder to open , which are based on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a single archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . you should note a few things :
a path can be relatively and@@ . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolutely .
special characters must be mas@@ cot . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file has the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of restrictions :
or it can not be differ@@ ed if a link indicates a file or a folder . then always a file is accepted as a link object . ( FTP : , SF@@ TP : ) .
there is no possibility of editing per@@ missions or modification of change . therefore , the per@@ missions or modification of change from the original . ( note the option confidential to the size ) ( This is possible only with local files ) .
the main purpose of use is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts first always the built @-@ in differences of spect@@ ator . to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select in K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part view from the context menu .
normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . if it is applied as a part , takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . besides , this is un@@ reliable , if the original files have changed since generating the patch file .
if &amp; co@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it supports only the same of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . that together or the same of folders is not supported in the wedge mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now He@@ is it comp@@ are ) already exists . besides , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can be combined just like the program diff@@ user from the Di@@ ff @-@ Tool collection .
I &apos;ve been using GPL @-@ programs for a long time and have learned a lot by watching the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who went this way or go for that way .
you have compiled the program from the sources and re@@ configure the configure script probably not the right pre@@ fix to KDE . in the default configuration , configure / usr / local , but then KDE can not find the resources for the user interface ( such as diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information about this issue .
when only the number of white signs are different , these lines are considered as identical . if however , only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . IF similar lines to each other , this is is &apos; but this &apos; is &apos; the case .
the editor notes for any difference in the files where he starts and where he ends . however , this important information is lost when the result is simply saved as a text file and it &apos;s too much effort to design extra its own file format which might store this information .
the effort for this has been too big so far . you can re @-@ restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to increase large amounts of text should be used another editor .
after removing the text is suddenly free ; No sr@@ c linear ; published and the text does not let you delete . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to distinguish from differences . even more break@@ up would be confusing and missing the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and troubles@@ hooting came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild web . thank you very much !
to make use of all features of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; use &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how you can use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage .
you will find a list of the latest amendments under htt@@ p : / / sound@@ proof 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the chan@@ gelo@@ g &apos;s file .
to compile and install &amp; install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; compile and install the following command in the basic folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
KDE @-@ dir are your ste@@ wards in your system where KDE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake is used , you should not have any trouble with comp@@ iling . if you encounter difficulties , please report on the &amp; k@@ block ; mailing lists .
cut ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or um@@ bili@@ ary removal ) copied into the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift ) insert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current position position or replacing the current mark .
only differences displayed : files that are identical in all folders appear not in the folder structure , and consequently not in the target folder .
( in the current version version you have to read changes to these options the folder with the function Re@@ fresh . )
there are only entries that displays differences . that also leads to that identical files are not already copied to the target folder . if the target folder these files does not already exist , they are missing after that . ( behaviour is likely to change in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons on selection of the source with the let@@ tering A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are attached from the corresponding window to the end of the selected group in result window ( if they are not already existing ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed as clicking on the button below .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . under@@ shoot in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white signs .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager includes a thumb@@ look of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the ongoing programs on the workplaces , to change its size , to stop it or postp@@ one it . it works within a desktop and several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running on current applications . applications can be selected and can be moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and other work surfaces .
the right @-@ menu @-@ menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on : when on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shortened , the right @-@ click menu has only the two entries P@@ ager ... and finishing . if however , the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ izing , maxim@@ izing , on desktop and ending . the commands make the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the desktop . appears only when applied to an application .
send the application to the selected virtual desktop . appears only when applied to an application .
if this box is marked , windows are within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager where the middle mouse button on the desktop and other areas of work can be moved .
when this field is crossed , in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed .
to cross this field the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops display . is it possible to display together with name , the names will be supplied with Ord@@ in@@ der , eg .
when this field is crossed , the background of each working surface is displayed as a background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small window at &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty spaces are displayed to make their selection possible .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple spelling with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the windows with their standard icon and pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . remark : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be determined : classical leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; released in a 2@@ x@@ n R@@ aster , as from P@@ ager applications in some other wind @-@ dimensions ; horizont@@ ally shows all virtual space spaces in a horizontal row and vertically positioned in a vertical series , which is very well suited for the representation on the field of work .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini@@ ature in the control panel . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , displaying the windows as symbols or with its content . besides , it runs outside the check@@ bar .
right click within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and then select from switch @-@ switch ... lets the dialog settings appear .
at the moment , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings , but you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or VI . if you don &apos;t have any spelling for the file , you must register as user root , or register to your system administrator . in this file you need to register the key moun@@ t@@ aller @-@ fashion and assign this value . possible values are :
da &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package base , you need a functioning installation of the KDE root package .

if you like &amp; kiss ; start a window like shown above . the main window of the screen , displays the enlarged section of the screen . in the following this window appears as magni@@ fying window .. The picture that is indicated in magni@@ fying window is an enlarged section of the screen and is referred to as the selection window .
in the default setting , &amp; k@@ may ; the area around the mouse @-@ cursor like a movable drive . alternatively , you can &amp; kiss ; to make a select display area in the magni@@ fying window ( drop @-@ in mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse @-@ cursor at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse @-@ cursor in the enlarged window is shown , select the set @-@ cursor in the enlarged window . please note that the mouse @-@ cursor issue is still not able to detect the form of the mouse cursor . this is always the standard crit@@ erion ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse @-@ cursor .
in the drop @-@ in mode , you can adjust the selection window to suit your needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse keys and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse @-@ cursor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button down , so you can catch the content of the magni@@ fier and shift it . this also goes with the arrow buttons .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift ; push @-@ down or the &amp; M@@ MB , you can change the drop @-@ down window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the drop @-@ up window . please note that the top left corner of the drop @-@ driver will remain firm and only to move the lower right corner .

&amp; ky mou@@ set@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , once the mouse @-@ cursor had a while on the same spot . it is meant to help people suffering from repeti@@ tive streets ( R@@ SI ) Syndrome and which each mouse @-@ click pains . in addition , it may em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; can handle the pain that arises on the clicks . unfortunately , however , by the simple fault of your computer are caused . unfortunately , you may also suffer from pain that interact with the use of your computer , you should check a doctor if this is not yet happened .
to clarify it again : even if &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; pain avoid that caused by clicking with the mouse , it is against pain that are caused by means of the mouse , useless . and as with all the ergonomic means , the result may be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements , and introduces a mouse @-@ click away as soon as you break the movement shortly .
if enabled , the smart move is activated , makes &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; move now the mouse , wait until the end of the movement , before letting the slo@@ ping of the mouse are exec@@ uting . in this way , you can execute the pulling in the mouse button . thus , the intelligent moving needs a little practice , but you get used quickly to it .
this delay has to be hidden after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; one click @-@ click .
if intelligent moving is enabled , the rot@@ ary number is moving ( 1 / 10 s ) active . here the time is hired , the &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; after shut@@ down the mouse button wait for the mouse to release again if there is no loading of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; is now enabled by clicking on the right and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a slow loading point to the left and back leads a double mou@@ sec@@ lick . these movements are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sha@@ set@@ ool ; the first time is started , but can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can shor@@ ten the reaction time . go to sound &amp; Multimedia , choose sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der Sound buffer to attach you to a lower value to shor@@ ten the answer time .
if this setting is marked , a &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; start with each start of &amp; k@@ de ; it is currently only available at &amp; k@@ . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , you can select the relevant documentation to find out how to start a program there .
put all settings back on the values that were set when opening the dialogue . have you already pushed the button , the settings will be reset to the status after the last turn@@ back of the dialog .
finally , use &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; first , in particular with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the intelligent moving you should start off first . if you then hit the automatic mouse click , you can later push the smart moving .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the responses of &amp; k@@ de ; to reduce lengths .
first , you should be aware of which places a mouse @-@ click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not represent a link , does not lead to in@@ experienced reactions . you can therefore park the mouse in such places until you want to use them again .
if your mouse ru@@ ck@@ elt , you should puri@@ fy your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you will not only clean the mouse @-@ ball , but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse .
first , you need to take out the mouse @-@ ball . as this happens , from mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be fast when you look at the bottom of the mouse .
when you removed the ball , you &apos;d have to see the roles . these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . dirt and dirt can easily compete with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; if you just have a difference . if in this case you use the smart moving tool , that means that &amp; mou@@ ld@@ set@@ ool ; no longer can end the operation by letting the mouse stop .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you can perform a click of mouse . thereby the status of &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; reset , and you can continue to work as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and puts the cursor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor where you want it . so , if you want to make your mouse on a neutral area of the working surface , if you &apos;re looking for a keyboard memory . safe zones for mouse @-@ cursor are creating &amp; win ; the gray areas for the mouse @-@ cursor and menus and the title @-@ lines of windows .
I try to work with the intel@@ lect , but I don &apos;t manage to edit it with it .
the intelligent moving is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very argu@@ ably possible to copy it in the cli@@ p@@ board and to paste again or move any other promotion , where you want to move your mouse at the right mouse button . but there will probably be some advice to them :
use the intelligent moving , if you just start using &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; mark it at the end of the text @-@ area a click @-@ click and keep the switching key pressed while you move the mouse cursor to the other end of the text and enter the button @-@ down button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . hence , each mouse is pressing a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the intelligent moving moves the different time . later , you can use the smart moving even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some practice .
to use &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; to use , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Win@@ dow has to be installed . that should be the case on most system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker , and these are properly furnished .
&amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; pressing the mouse @-@ cursor over once the mouse @-@ cursor . this program is designed for people who suffer from the R@@ SI syndrome , and those who are suffering the degradation of the buttons .
&amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; can also be configured so that a certain time is waiting for a pulling process begins , before the mouse button starts . in this way , the pulling and dra@@ wer can be performed with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth : is a program , with the bl@@ unt users can speak their computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , word@@ me users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list of the main sentences , which are said again .
on the first page of the assistant ( lin@@ kes scre@@ enshot ) you enter the command , which is later used for the voice output of text . further details can be found in the description of the furnishings .
on the second page , select the standard text @-@ book @-@ book . from the text books you can often choose text passages , without having to type in . the text passages may naturally be edited .
on the third page ( ri@@ ver@@ screen enshot ) you determine the dictionary for the Wor@@ ter@@ ment . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you may terminate the list of words with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , so that only spell words used in the Wor@@ ds of Wor@@ ds .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth , clearly arranged and contains essentially a input field for the key@@ note of your propositions ( the lower white field in the scre@@ enshot ) and a reference memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the scre@@ enshot ) .
if you have k@@ mouth , correct , you can enter the sets in the input field , which you want to hear . each explicit proposition is attached to the processor . you can select from these propositions which are to be spoken again .
with the menu @-@ entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the dialog dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog includes two mapping cards , voice @-@ overs and settings , the site Wor@@ ter@@ is@@ tion , as well as the page C@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the body &apos;s voice output , enter the command to call the language @-@ generator . in the selection box under the input field , you place the strings , with which text is passed on to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass on the text . select the cross @-@ box if the text is to be passed unchanged as standard typ@@ ing to the language generator .
if the cross @-@ box is not selected , the text is given as parameters . you can use the following wild@@ card :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation for your language generator . examples can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
to use as a language service as a language service &amp; k@@ mouth , as the first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the other settings are provided on this page . the kt@@ on language service is available and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection box promotion in the selection of a text broadcast , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cuts of text or by selecting a text passage in the menu text @-@ book or in the bar for text mess@@ aging books .
with the choice of instant speech , the selected text cycle is directly addressed and added in addition to the cache . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text cycle is first entered into the input field .
with the second selection box of the editing window of the hand@@ book @-@ book you can specify , whether the text @-@ book @-@ book can be saved automatically with the closing of the editing window .
with the selection of text @-@ book @-@ book store the book is stored . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text @-@ password is not stored . select before saving , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text is to be saved .
the site of Wor@@ ter@@ is@@ tion contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the Wor@@ ding @-@ Shift . in the main window , next to the input field displays &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box where this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection box , you can choose the dictionary out of the dictionary .
with buttons on the right side , you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the sequence of books or export them to a file . below the list you can adjust the language to the dictionary .
choose this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the &amp; k@@ not ; -@@ Dokumentation der . the frequency of the individual words is easily identified by folding the occurrence . additionally , you can compare the list of words with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary to insert just correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth , asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are put together , and how to be wei@@ ghted .
with this option you place a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; new entered words automatically inser@@ ts into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time .
the main area of the window for the processing of text @-@ books is two divided . in the upper part , the text@@ books are represented as tree @-@ structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected record . if you have selected a text sheet , you can change the text sheet or the related short@@ cut . if you have selected a text @-@ book , you can only change its name .
actions like new text passages or books to add or selected text books and books , you can either get the selection in the tool@@ bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a fold @-@ up menu .
the order of text @-@ books or text passages can you change by pulling with the mouse at the new location or with the arrow buttons and the old &amp; old ;
the selected text is cut off and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text box is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the process .
the selected text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if the text box is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the process .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is located in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected propositions of the reference .
if this menu item is enabled , a movable tool@@ bar is displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar is placed by default via the editing window directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the refined left side and distor@@ ting , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
if this menu item is enabled , a narrow run@@ way is displayed in the lower part of the main window with indications of the state of &amp; k@@ mouth . displayed , if not crossed , this status bar has been hidden .
if this menu item is enabled , a post@@ pon@@ able gro@@ in for text @-@ scripts with entries are displayed . the bar is arranged by default via the editing window directly under the tool@@ bar . by mouse click on the refined left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
probably you have the command for the voice output right or not completely inspired . set settings k@@ mouth . set up ... , open the page General settings and enter the command for the voice output on the map of speech . ( see the dialog dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer for more details . )
festival is a language edition of the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license permits it to use the festival for free and to re@@ distribute it without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for the voice of voice output , it is assumed that festival in the folder / usr / local / festival is installed . the command to voice output is then :

to show an example of the command line for the set of voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ et@@ ts folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following commands :
for the third example the option has to be transmitted as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of Ph@@ on@@ gs into a Wav@@ ed@@ i . this is why you need an additional program to dis@@ integrate the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the german text into Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA will be installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax would like to add the last character of the text , so that an additional sign needs to be added . the full command is therefore more time @-@ consuming than in the other examples :
( Cat - ; echo _ / usr / local / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / dec@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all sections of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as standard input has to be turned on .
the VO @-@ dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standard interface for voice output .

since the voice @-@ generator is stored only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you just have to use as kt@@ as@@ per as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to adjust the site to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which is installed in the dialog dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth , if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successful to use , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ mouth : 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth , about 15 MB storage ( and in addition memory for the language generator ) , which depends in detail on your computer and its configuration .

when the first start of Mon@@ t@@ sm@@ s or as long as there are no speakers listed , the body card spokes@@ person is displayed . see also . if you set up at least one or@@ ator , the body card is General . see .
most T@@ TS @-@ syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those which differ in volume or speed . they can also set up multiple variants for a syn@@ thesizer . a so @-@ furnished combination of language , syn@@ thesizer , voice , gender , volume and speed is called as speaker . you should at least use a speaker before you use &amp; ld@@ ts ; use , since the program indicated Disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise used the default speaker .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several print expectations for the same printer .
if you click on the Kar@@ wi@@ card spokes@@ man in Vic@@ t@@ sm@@ s , the body card is displayed , and then it will automatically appear if you start t@@ sm@@ s and not yet established a spokes@@ man .
all already decorated speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear at the top in the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not exist .
with a click of a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a click of a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select with one click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to slide the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speaker in the list also determines its priority .
on one of these buttons , click on one of these buttons , to apply your changes to the ongoing &amp; t@@ ect@@ ins ; system .
choose a m@@ poster here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a jun@@ ker and girl &apos;s voice .
click here , on the page you will see the speaker on the map speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts . go back to the body card General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , in order for the T@@ TS service of &amp; k@@ de ; start . now , you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to read text in order to create and manage text files . see .
if you set up at least one or@@ ator you can set the language score system of &amp; k@@ . click on the top @-@ card in order to open this map . here you can set some general options .
highlight this activation field to activate the &amp; T@@ TS . this start successfully starts the KDE T@@ TS @-@ Service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the map orders will be set up and read off . see . remove the mark@@ er , the K@@ TT@@ SD is hal@@ ted and the T@@ TS @-@ System of &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activ@@ ates .

if this note marks and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is automatically marked in the control panel in the control panel , it disappears once the pre @-@ reading is complete .
with the buttons in this series you can start writing jobs , stop and resume .
using the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ cli@@ p@@ board pre @-@ reading or open a text file to pre @-@ read . you can also change the speaker for an order .
click OK or OK , then all changed settings will be changed on all sides .
the cart @-@ card orders is only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD was started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the top statement in general and activate a voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . check first if &amp; object ; then select the text that is to be read , and select the text in the main menu . after a short time the voice output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also jump this step also , but then many &amp; HTML , lines and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; in case you can read the text shown . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text that is to be read , and select the text in the main menu text . then the language edition should start .
this also works when &amp; Kate ; in other applications is embedded , like &amp; on ; in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta ; .

filter for string qu@@ eting offer a good opportunity in &amp; kt@@ ts ; incorrect or fla@@ wed out @-@ spoken news . the file k@@ mail .x@@ ml , that belongs to the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; belongs , is a good example . you removed the tags br and b from the messages , the k@@ mail , and also the phrase / local / In@@ box , since this can be assumed in most cases as provided .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; they are not required for normal work with &amp; ts ; filters are not required .
in filtr@@ es , text is edited , before being sent to the program speech Disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unciation to replace false words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker or to circum@@ vent certain defects of voice synthesis and their voices .
to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; sets four types of texts .
the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ ways has the highest priority . it is presented to all other orders and keeps these orders . when the output of the Screen reader is pre @-@ read , the returned orders will continue again .
aler@@ ts have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg . processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and regular text . these orders will continue after the issue of warning .
News do the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application , the news used . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a site template , you can enter &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who enter the room exactly . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also news . read about it .
the rest are simple text entries . each order that you initiate from the Car@@ part orders is a text contract . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of an application that uses text entries . text entries are intended for the issue prolonged texts which have no special urgency .
all four modes of order are processed in queue , with the exception of the output of screen readers . if an application reads the output of a screen ruler , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such an reads , this issue will be stopped and termin@@ ates .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text messages as well as on &amp; k@@ ins ; -@@ News .
filter will edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future , there are still further types of filters .
palette ket@@ ten@@ ers replace parts of a text by other text . the inser@@ ting parts can be delivered either as words or regular expressions . &amp; object ; the set of chat @-@ ti@@ cons such as : - ) through text or for the format@@ ting of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understanding possible .
&amp; XML ; re@@ former use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; include some X@@ SL@@ T files to translate &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with speaker @-@ op@@ tionally you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program , which sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have set for example on the body card for a female voice , you can read text of KDE messages about it . Si@@ eh@@ e can read about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules according to which he is applied to a voice output . if the filter represents that its rules do not apply , it gives the text unchanged at the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ or ; alert notification ; sent , it is processed by all the activated filters on the page described below . the processing by the filter takes place in the order from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the furnished standard filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and you will see the next install@@ di@@ alogues displayed below .
for the installation of strings , you must type a list of words or regular expressions as a comparative pattern . these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged against the associated replacement text . large and spelling is not observed in comparison .
enter a name for your filters . you can choose this name as you like , and you just have to distinguish yourself from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column and will replace it in accordance with the string of string . the list is processed in the sequence from top to bottom .
click here to move the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save the current list or delete . download a list from a file , the entries are app@@ ended from the file to the existing list .
if here is a language entered , the filter is only applied when the spokes@@ person is spoken for the text order one of the languages listed here . you can also select multiple languages if you click on the &quot; C@@ tr@@ l &quot; button at the mouse click .
here is a value entered , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID @-@ reference programs will be available with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers you have to we@@ ep . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID @-@ 34@@ 32 an@@ indicates , you only may use copies .
the breakdown filter will only be applied to the text when all conditions with an entry in a box can apply if they agree . are all input fields blank , the filter is applied to all texts .
when compared with words the string qu@@ ket@@ ten@@ er filter contain regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. the words must therefore be limited by divi@@ ding space ( spaces ) .
in this manual you will find no manual for writing regular expressions . but if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; expressions &amp; # 160 ; expressions , click the &amp; # 160 ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ulations &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the bundle .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Reg@@ ers translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format into another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such transformations . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ shaped XML . the relief program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the Environ@@ ment@@ .@@ AT@@ H environment , is also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
with the Spe@@ aker Elec@@ tions , you can send texts to a certain speaker that is placed on the map speaker , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can for example set that lyrics from a female voice should be read from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text attached to the filter , there is a spokes@@ man for the text . the speaker is selected using the speaker properties which provides the text attached to &amp; kt@@ ts ; send the text attached to &amp; kt@@ ts . with the speaker , you can write the selected speaker .
here is a value entered , the filter is applied in case the text contains the regular expression . is on your system the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; expressions , you can call this with one click on the button to get help with the input .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression on the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
here you place the properties of the desired filter conditions here . if the text is met up the filter conditions shown above , the spokes@@ person is selected , which corresponds to the desired requirements . click on the button to view the dialog language selection .
use these buttons to store or load your spre@@ aders or to delete all settings .
the speaker @-@ op@@ tionally available is applied only to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in a box function . you must insert at least one condition .
the language copy @-@ API , of &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmer can give their applications T@@ TS @-@ capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , enabling &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the VO API of &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is are available on the col@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand voice output services via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d program on the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
here is the text of the text to read and option a language code like &amp; eg . en , de &amp; etc .
there are even more commands you can apply . for a list of commands you give
open two &amp; console ; window . run first in a window , then t@@ sm@@ s in the other .
none of the named language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Ren@@ former@@ filters furnished , but when using the module for festival pages are not read @-@ read .
due to an error in the 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone so S@@ able at all works . you also have to do that if you do not use this voice to pre @-@ read websites . please make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and found via the environmental variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation seem to cause errors in syn@@ thesizer , so that whole sentences were ski@@ pped or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish is spent . what can I do against it ?
first , make sure the option h@@ enco@@ ding is set to the correct value for the respective language . if there are problems with certain signs or words , these may be solved by a string qu@@ eting filter . see .

the list of the above mentioned languages can be un@@ complete or outdated . therefore , you draw the description of syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages . check out also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , according to information , which are not contained in this manual .
the program &quot; speech @-@ Disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for use of another syn@@ thesizer , you get in touch with the developer team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; byp@@ ass filter is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to compile &amp; kt@@ ts ; you need a current development environment of KDE ( Version 3.4 or newer ) including packages col@@ b and the developer files for the program &quot; speech Disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have the source tex@@ te from &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can refer from source text archives or downloaded the ball rolling each night , and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use first if speech disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your language syn@@ thesizer . you can use the shell script through the shell script .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.@@ 4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; that is said to be the program of speech Disp@@ at@@ cher . the program t@@ ms@@ gr is said to be developed , that the installation of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script SPD is no longer needed .
a long text will be dis@@ semb@@ led in individual sentences . the user can leave satellite or sat@@ a two , repeat the output or break down .
when an application text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; moreover , it can specify the characteristics of the preferred intercom for the edition . so if you choose a speaker , whose language English and its sex is female , it will automatically determine the most suitable speaker . if you want to know more about it , how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker be@@ g you will see in .
if you click on the map spokes@@ person to add to add to insert a speaker into the list or click on Edit , the driver card holder will display . for example , the installation of the module for festival Interactive is shown . for details on the modules you will find under .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . when the path to festival in P@@ AT@@ H is included , you just have to enter the festival .
select the text enco@@ ding for text , handed over to the festival . when voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; known , this setting is made automatically . generally speaking , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak , use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders you can set up volume , intercom velocity and pitch of synthetic language . if you cannot select some controllers , and display them gray , the voice you have chosen does not allow these settings to be displayed .
some voices such as multi @-@ Sy@@ n voices need several seconds to be loaded on account of their size . if you mark this approach , these voices are already charged when starting K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( with more storage power ) the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized faster .
if this box is not selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forget to apply to apply ) . see .
this activation code marks will display the window t@@ sm@@ s in the system window . otherwise , after starting only the icon t@@ sm@@ s in the system stage is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this activation code marks and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not exp@@ ire , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . there@@ for you have the possibility to read or control elsewhere .
here are all orders listed in queue , along with the application , set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the straight set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the map speaker .
with the buttons in this row you can choose a ta@@ st@@ ise in the order that is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or go back . ( but not every order consists of several sentences ) .
with a click on OK , all changes of settings are made ( also on the other flas@@ h@@ cards ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system of the system . then click on this icon to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead Al@@ sa , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the map audio . see also .
here are only text entries listed and managed . expenses of screen readers , aler@@ ts and messages are not displayed . more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; can be found in .
select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , it has been compiled or set ; either without support for the appropriate audi@@ om@@ o@@ dul or &amp; kt@@ ts ; the necessary libraries can not load .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ co@@ de is to be used for the audio shows , choose the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . if you have selected Al@@ sa , choose the PC@@ M device here . see also
set the intercom velocity here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds to approximately half and 200@@ ak ; % about the double normal intercom speed . so these settings can be implemented , the program must be installed so@@ x .
click to apply the new settings for the running &amp; on ; -@@ System to take over .
the list of al@@ sa devices contains all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to find out which device works with you . in doubt choose default .
on this map you can set special actions that will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of voice orders :
the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ ways has the highest priority . it is presented to all other orders and keeps these orders . after the output of the Screen reader has been read , the returned orders will be resum@@ ed .
aler@@ ts have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg . processor is reserved to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and regular text . these orders will continue after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application which out@@ puts the messages . if you win , just a long text on a website , you can use &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone welcome anyone who enter the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen @-@ reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio shows in the queue .
this audio file will always be played , if a normal text order is interrupted . if both introductory sound is active as well as introductory message , the introductory sound is derived from the introductory message .
the settings on this map are valid only for normal text messages . for messages , aler@@ ts and the expenses of screen controllers , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to be able to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ No@@ fy messages can be read , start Mon@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click aler@@ ts . the flas@@ h@@ list is issued .
highlight this activation field to dict@@ ate the pre @-@ reading of &amp; k@@ de ; this setting is not marked , the remaining settings are de@@ activated and &amp; ts ; reads no messages .
this attitude is marked , noti@@ fications , in which a sound is ab@@ used , of &amp; object ; not pre @-@ read .
use these buttons to add events to the list or to delete them . if you click on the button Add , appears a dialog , where you can choose the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone is mentioned in a IR@@ C message to your nickname .
all events for which no other is stated in the list are ignored by &amp; ts ; ignored .
use this drop @-@ down to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event hits . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following wild@@ card :
you can enter the properties of the desired speaker here . standard select the speaker that is shown on the list on the map speaker as a top item . see also .
note that there are three levels of events which are determined for a specific event of a specific application , it will run . otherwise , the action for all other events of the particular application is carried out . as the last resort the action is for wearing , which was specified under standard ( all other events ) .
the event All messages for applying standard ( all other events can not be deleted from the list . here you can set the messages as follows :
use the button save to save the settings for the aler@@ ts to a file . use the button loading to load the settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click on Dele@@ te . all entries except All sub@@ commands will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to highlight text for voice output . this standard includes brands for controlling voices , intercom speed , the tone , the voice and the tone . furthermore , brands for controlling the pron@@ unciation of for example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ da XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently , &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you must install the Rab _ di@@ ph@@ onic voice ( bri@@ tish male ) since this is the standard voice , the festival in the edition of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % is set , the SS@@ ML @-@ text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous .
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ T@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / EN &quot; &quot; htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / speech @-@ Syn@@ thesis / syn@@ thes@@ is@@ .@@ dt@@ d &quot; &gt; Who has slept in my bed ? asked Mama B@@ är . who has slept in my bed ? asked the B@@ ären@@ song . &#93; &#93; &gt;
there are two types of filters - normal filters and indi@@ an unlimited filter ( SD@@ S filter ) . SB@@ Ds devi@@ ates text into single sentences . thus , the first set of text must start , not the whole text order . thus , you can also jump @-@ jump or break down , even if the language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers does not directly support this .
here you can see the pro@@ w@@ ess filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set up as a pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter . you can change its settings or add additional pro@@ w@@ ess filter , but it will be dis@@ coura@@ ged from it .
the easiest way to learn how to set up the Spe@@ ech@@ art choice . place the Spe@@ ak selection again , change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker change . you , of course , you must have set up more than one or@@ ator , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then faster can start with reading , as only the first set needs to be processed and not the entire text block , which can last very long ,
they will then stop or break some text orders on the car@@ part orders , even if the language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers will not support this function .
for these reasons , the regular satellite filter will be automatically set if you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ s for the first time . he can not be off , just removed . change anything about this filter , unless you know what you are doing .
Sat@@ z@@ bor@@ der@@ og@@ ation filter text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional and add a t@@ abl@@ ation sign ( Dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) at the satellite parameters ( tab plate ) will be automatically removed from the text ( tab plate ) . notice that the default satellite filter will be attached to the typ@@ ing .
SB@@ D filters are never applied on &amp; k@@ or ; -@@ News ( k@@ enter ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you removed from a normal Sat@@ z@@ bor@@ der@@ og@@ ation filter , you can re @-@ insert this again by loading the in &amp; kt@@ ts ; contained file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c .
on the lower part Interphone language you can re@@ write the Spe@@ ak settings for the application . the body card is displayed when
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the body card ) . in other words , there are no spokes@@ person .
use of the most suitable radi@@ ator , which shows all the characteristics of a single speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , choose &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker are failing . otherwise , &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , which most likely correspond to the original characteristics .
choose the method of entering the required spokes@@ man , clicking on one of the selections .
select the characteristics of the desired speaker . if this feature does not play a role , do not give anything .
highlight this activation , if the property needs to have priority over other properties . you can also set multiple markings here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as a priority property . you &apos;ll want to use this property rarely . the only case where you may need to provide the attribute language , lies ahead when you know that a particular application text is sent in a different language than the within the working environment .
to use all the properties in the area spokes@@ man to clear the following , click on the button speaker , and then use the speaker , which is most sought after .
in this case 0 is for the final text order in queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number , input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr starts immediately when it is started . I have ple@@ aded Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I do not get any feedback .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and &amp; ts ; probably you must finish G@@ Stre@@ amer . at G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.@@ 8 . if the problem is not solved by G@@ Stre@@ amer may be installed a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can attempt to update G@@ Stre@@ amer or un@@ install G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio shows about Al@@ sa is not working when I stop playing music simultaneously with another application . if I have a text order , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . at the &amp; console ; appears a message that says : &apos; to open PC@@ M .
on your system there is the problem that conflicts can occur at al@@ sa , which prevent the simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . notes for possible solutions can be found on the al@@ sa project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I loaded an additional voice for the festival on the internet . I installed them and can &apos;t use them at the festival , but T@@ t@@ sm@@ s do not show this voice .
add in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / believe that the new voice is added . as a guide you can serve the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL , on which you have found the voice to the developer .
on the top card audio there is a setting speed . so this works , the program must be installed so@@ x and be noticeable over the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers mod@@ s such as festival Interactive does offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice is this active or in@@ active .
the settings for the intercom speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; ( see ) if you are completely courageous . ( see ) or , if you are completely courageous , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ det@@ ector , and set the intercom speed .
I don &apos;t make it that websites can be read with a female voice . I have set up a female pilot speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice .
at the Festival 1.@@ 95 , the Day of S@@ able Gender does not seem to work . so the festival does not produce any faults , but then the X@@ SL &apos;s file re@@ converting S@@ ML to S@@ event@@ ing the gender tags . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a separate drawing qu@@ eting filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no longer sat@@ a - or go back . on the cart @-@ made orders is displayed , the order actu@@ ates only out of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
pun@@ ctu@@ ation characters ( point , question mark , comm@@ as , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter out . use for these signs instead a filter to the pro@@ w@@ ess detection .

Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS @-@ syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are multiple voices and languages supported . with many voices you can set up volume , intercom speed and audio @-@ height with &amp; ts ; set .
you need to install at least one language . help to do this in the instructions that will be supplied with festival . want to read websites , you must install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you have to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .
this voice puts festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / usr / Russian / . if you set up the Russian voices , you have to enter for the voices ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . choose an ky@@ ri@@ ll@@ ische ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding like for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the festival is usually included in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Linux &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , you are looking for the first on the CDs of your distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the codi@@ fication must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the coding must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Ky@@ ri@@ ll@@ isch as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . then the Festival takes the le@@ xi@@ cal analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it generates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no full language version is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates additional software to create these Di@@ phone . Festival generates these from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; you can also produce this phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be obtained from German texts Di@@ phone . more information can be found under .
this procedure will add additional Wr@@ apper code to festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Voice files will not be installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ folder , but in the folder festival / lib / . instructions can be found under

this hand@@ book explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ station ; , a module for the &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; which allows the administration of the network interfaces , routine and DNA settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed through choice of K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ station ; -@@ package was designed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way , as other settings from the &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; allow for users to create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; display the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting @-@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in the &amp; K@@ Menu ; start .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf could not install network hardware . physical equipment and its drivers have already to be fully installed and configured so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device itself shows and the adjustment of the network features allows .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed at installing &amp; Linux ; installed and set up . network devices later added , the drivers need to be loaded via adaptation of the following files , corresponding to the core version :
the module network settings is loaded when the option network settings in the &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this module will automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform can not be recognized , the fil@@ thy selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and release will be best hit . by flag@@ ging the setting up to @-@ again , the definition can be made permanently . when starting the network settings , this selection will be automatically set .
changing the network settings is possible only in the system management mode . before , all options are displayed gray , meaning , the settings can be considered only , the change is not possible . in the system management mode , you can access by clicking the button management mode at the bottom of the module . it is the input of the password required .
in the system management mode , the total functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three hor@@ semen :
the rider network interfaces is used to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices will be displayed . from the rider network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed :
you can set up the settings on the network interfaces through selection of the desired device in the list and click the button &quot; button . &quot; in the dialog device , you can set up .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button &quot; button &quot; and it shows the dialogue with further possibilities .
with the selection Autom@@ atically , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched by a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings are required at the same time with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP @-@ information at every system start , therefore no further adjustment can be required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the choice of manual , without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be made TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address should be specified . in the input field net@@ mask is set to define the sub@@ net@@ mask .
if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when loading . if the initi@@ alisation is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values specified in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would result in TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you may notice whether the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the Administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched on if required . switching on an in@@ activated network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on interface ...
network devices can be activated or switched on if required . switch off a activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on interface ...
sets up the IP address of the machine in the local sub@@ net , which conve@@ ys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ networks .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface needs to be selected from the network in which the gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers may only be able to understand IP addresses . if the machine htt@@ p / / / www.@@ em@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org lists , DNS trig@@ gers these names in an IP address such as 12@@ 3,@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the nam@@ esp@@ ace section of the rider &apos;s nam@@ es@@ solution allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed , or modified by selecting a single , up or demo@@ tion in the list with the buttons , or possessions are ranked in the priority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by clicking the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; from the group machine to nam@@ esp@@ ace can be added to a DNS server . it will be added to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Name Server &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button Add . the entry will then be added to the list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the group machine to nam@@ esp@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select an entry and then click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edit ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will show the dialog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of specifically known calcul@@ ators describes billing @-@ to @-@ IP address for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when using any DNS server . in small , closed networks can replace the DNS server .
usually , the list contains a well @-@ known calcul@@ ator some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses , which still will be used in the test version of IP in the future version 4 .
enter the IP @-@ address of the known host and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as is displayed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; enter the name of the known host and click the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button . if the well @-@ known computer has several ali@@ ases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add Fol@@ dable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and enter the further alias name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
select an entry of a numer@@ ical host from the list and choose Edit .... to edit the dialog &apos;s computer screen .
it can be done one of the following tasks , then by clicking OK the list of static hosts is updated .
the settings done in the module settings are not immediately available in the system . to enable the changes , needs to be set in a &amp; console ; the following command must be reset .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf : is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ s@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source text .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly r@@ pm packages ) , it ranges , if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the r@@ pm package and install in a &amp; console ; with r@@ pm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with a graphical interface as a package or an installation tool using your distribution .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ not is sufficient , but also the development packages with libraries and other applications will be needed .
this only is recommended by experienced users . however , it is not difficult , &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to compile them . the following commands should do so .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on fundamental network technology will be given , in the second one will discuss all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changing configuration files .
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information on the integration of the PC is conve@@ yed in a small ( home ) network .
currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found great circulation . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . this description is therefore currently focusing on the popular IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is to assign the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the administrator , the contact point , which may be used a valid IP address , or , if available , D@@ H@@ CP can not be chosen redund@@ antly !
when setting up an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a specially for this purpose in order to avoid IP address information with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded in the Internet , therefore their use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by hiring a gat@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all computers are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.@@ 0@@ 0 ; .@@ 0.@@ 0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.0.@@ 1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the default route is required for the IP instructions .
the power @-@ address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.0.@@ 1 is reserved for IP intercourse in the local own machine . usually the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.0.@@ 1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this part there are the configuration files that have been affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are placed in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is dynam@@ ically modified at DSL connections , so it is not surprised if in case of active DSL connections another content is found to be established there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE , is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ ad config . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for member drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on one volume . the first goal was to provide a surface for tar , which also provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar to quickly , selective excer@@ pts . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife did : how much longer it takes when you secure it ?
before a tape can be used , it needs to be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can happen in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; take the band back and read the pr@@ elo@@ ck of the tape . realize &amp; k@@ dat ; the preview of the band does not , you are asked if the band is to be format@@ ted .
realize &amp; k@@ dat ; the preview , looks for the suitable index on your plate . can this not be found , you will be asked if the Band@@ index will be re@@ generated .
everything goes smoothly , it changes the symbol for the belt drive to indicate that the band was incorporated . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the content of the tape can now be searched out by folding the item for the band .
prior to the termination of the ban@@ anas , first of all , the integration must be solved . there are three methods to achieve this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; provides an amendment of the symbol for the band to recognize that the involvement of the band has been solved and displays a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be ej@@ ected without any danger .
before a volume of &amp; k@@ dat ; it may be used to form it from &amp; k@@ dat ; format@@ ted .
a band@@ age must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not correspond to the format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; . sets out your belt drive , must be format@@ ted before you use the belt of &amp; k@@ dat files . Flo@@ ppy @-@ drives usually insert a format@@ ting of the belt , DAT drives , however , not .
after entering the band@@ name and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format@@ ting of the belt . all the data on the tape are lost thereby ! after the completion of the format the band is automatically integrated and is ready @-@ up .
before you bu@@ mp the backup process , you need to select the files that are dealt with . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it is backed up to this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . only those files are stored in the profile .
highlight files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are guaranteed .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select from the ...
once the backup was introduced , the dialog settings for backup will open . in this dialog , you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you confirm the setting , the dialog appears secure . the dialogue shows the progress of the process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
highlight a file or folder in one of the archives files in an entry for the drive . it is only checked for the selected file or folder .
highlight the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick . it will only be selected the marked files and / or sub@@ folder .
right @-@ click on one of the archives and select the menu item in check ....
once the audit process has been started , the dialogue will appear for veri@@ fying . in this dialog , you can check once again your selection and change the folder @-@ folder for verification .
when you confirm the settings for the review , the dialogue will be examined . this dialog indicates the progress of the verification process , as well as the transmission of data and the remaining time .
before you can restore the restore , the files that are to be recovered . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives files belonging to the band@@ wagon . it will be restored only the selected file or sub@@ folders .
highlight the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . it will be restored only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives , and select from the menu to restore ....
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog provides settings for recovery . in this dialog , you can even check your selection and change the folder @-@ folder for recovery .
when you confirm the settings for recovery , the dialog appeared . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the transmission of data and the remaining time .
sometimes it proves to be necessary to rebuild the band@@ inde@@ x@@ file using the belt content . this procedure destro@@ ys all existing index files for this volume . you can create the index on two types from the band :
this will create a backup profile with the currently selected files and default settings . you can use the following settings for a backup profile :
the current folder @-@ folder in which the backup should take place . according to the group@@ ing files , the list of files is automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder .
for all the files listed under backup files , only the files are stored in the file system , such as the folder . folder , which lie on other fil@@ es@@ ystems , you can enter separately among backup files . each entry is considered apart from tar .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then .
the name of the file that is used to establish changes since the last incre@@ mental security .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before the call for tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons are added ; and lt ; files was not yet completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings via the C@@ D@@ at menu ... in the Settings menu , you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the belt drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ tool@@ bar version of the band@@ tool .
is this attitude active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band is d@@ ashed the instruction to drive . in some drives this is necessary before reading or writing approaches can be performed .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; invo@@ ke a throw from the band@@ pass . maybe this attitude does not work with all band drives .
if the option is switched on , it is dis@@ solving the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically dis@@ car@@ ded the belt . use this option not at Flo@@ ppy @-@ Stream@@ ers .
if the option switched on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ core block@@ age for the belt drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must communicate &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your belt drive will communicate .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band format@@ ted , it writes a file at the beginning of the tape . this file should only cover one memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band @-@ ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , whereby calcul@@ ator the full name of the system is format@@ ted on which the tape is format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that has been format@@ ted since the epoch where the tape is format@@ ted .
the band @-@ ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which manage directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work , as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup editor . this symbol is only active when a tape is integrated .
&amp; ks@@ ecosystem ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; the viewer is suitable for in@@ experienced users who don &apos;t know where to get information about your system or where the system leaves different protocol files . in addition , &amp; ks@@ car@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems which occur on their server .
&amp; ks@@ car@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . is an simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system leaves the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; ks@@ car@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that appear on their server . &amp; ks@@ car@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some extended features , which can be fil@@ tered and evaluated for certain programs using the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.@@ 4.1 &amp; ks@@ ecosystem ; a number of useful features include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ s@@ log server and for sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included , and are explained in the next chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screen shot , &amp; ks@@ ecosystem ; functions are available , with whose help the individual protocol lines of a protocol @-@ file easy to filter and sort . the individual ways to sorting and fil@@ tern are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start of the start , we tried to open the system &apos;s system - the system protocol . will not open it , and it opens , instead of which a small news window , so you have &amp; ks@@ car@@ log ; very likely not with system management right . the protocol files are usually found in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually no justification to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter a string into the filter bar , so that only log files will be displayed in the filter bar . in default , the drop @-@ off section contains the entry box next to the filter . then a protocol version will only display if in one of the columns contain the string of the filter &apos;s pattern .
at this point you can also select another entry . the strings of the filter terms will then be assigned only with the entries in the column selected column , and wear it in the filter bar the name of a process , so shows you &amp; ks@@ car@@ log ; all protocol lines which were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in default setting and helps you detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of the level error are displayed with a sp@@ ic@@ uous color as protocol @-@ lines of the level note . the color @-@ color representation of protocol @-@ lines can be switched off dialog .
if you want to show just certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , you can select the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can , for example , be useful when you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server .
in addition , you can jump to new lines , jump in the context menu of the main window , in order to view all the new log @-@ lines .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; allows the display of several protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu to open up additional sub@@ window and to manage it . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol on display .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has a private website at htt@@ p : / / ks@@ ystem@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ a@@ g you will find further up @-@ to @-@ date information on the supply sources of &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; you will also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion Archi@@ ving : ks@@ ystem@@ log ; in the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following as named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the V In@@ it system develops rapidly into the standard for controlling the program starts while driving the system in the &amp; Linux world . and therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful , and at the same time flexible is the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it .
I will not go on historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about myself : - ) .
the In@@ it binary file is below / s@@ bin and not below / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to put a machine on System V In@@ it without putting a re @-@ install and re @-@ format . therefore , you need to make sure the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that contains the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ ite and the following more ste@@ wards :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d includes a lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service that you want to start when driving the system or changing to another round @-@ level . system services include such things like network , NFS , &amp; sen@@ d@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc . system services do not involve such things as set@@ ters , which will only once start . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be on the one hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems do not have a lot of use for it . you can also do a r@@ c.@@ so in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something when driving out , which has to do with the serial connection .
the kernel is looking for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one he finds .
the standard @-@ level @-@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see in the initial area a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably realize that the default running level 3 is . if you would like to change it , then you can perform / etc / in@@ it@@ tab from hand and change the 3 . if you have done a little altern@@ ated , then you get repaired by re@@ boot the system and execute the following :
but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you enter -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like :
you will notice that in this folder there are no real files . instead , each entry is a short@@ cut to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how does it start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? very simple : each of the scripts is written that it is an argument as start and stop . you can actually start this scripts from hand on the command line as follows :
this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it includes a K , the script will stop with the argument stop . if it includes a S , the script will start with the argument start .
some people wish to build a simple way of setting machines for many purposes . I could win &amp; win ; a server running @-@ level , which leaves only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; sen@@ d@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . , too , I could also have a user @-@ level , the &amp; win ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc .
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another character device is simple to not tri@@ vial : just drag an entry to one of the six Run@@ ning Control services to one of the six Run@@ es to start him on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . thereby , the entry is removed from its original runner @-@ level ( or its position ) . this will only happen if they draw an entry in the field of disposable sy@@ ring@@ ing services .
note : entries are moved when you move them to a new zone . to simply select them from the Edit menu , or select from the context menu and insert them into the target area -- even then , if the same entry has already existed in the target area of action .
the sorting number of an item can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries , before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the trash . be therefore careful .
you can use the Tab@@ ulator key to activate the different work@@ spaces ( Av@@ ail@@ able System@@ services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ time 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of above or below the previous one .
to move an entry to another round @-@ level , move it with cutting into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X use ) and add it to the required round @-@ level with inser@@ tion ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an order , press the input button to switch to the Properties dialog . use the tab@@ s button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by re @-@ pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the danger of data loss , all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; restored . changes to preferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ le@@ vel@@ n and now the machine starts continuously . what can I do ?
enter at L@@ IL@@ O -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to launch in individual user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the standard @-@ level for a reasonable value ( 3 should usually be fine ) .
I &apos;ve provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for the execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE , or Deli@@ very ( D@@ LD ) you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details of the distribution manual .
the way such as system services can be started in these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to the configuration for the proprietary furnishings of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not conform to the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you use any other distribution : please check if all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) simply complete without message when their configuration files are not present or wrong .
the importance of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ time varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the lap@@ level , so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
once you have made changes , you have to save it . either you use the appropriate icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry point in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window is made up of two mapping cards , user account and the user tro@@ op . do not select the requested user or the desired group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears in the dialog user and group characteristics .
some car@@ o cards are only represented when you have enabled advanced system preferences . only if you have enabled placing bets ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a body card will be created where you can make individual settings . further mapping cards appear , if shadow passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD @-@ uniform .
the Pass@@ word Pass@@ word administration appears , if shadow @-@ passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as are installed in BSD @-@ uniform .
this map appears only if for at least one single file system ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable at the quot@@ a user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here , for each user , parameters can be changed for each user :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected using a base system using a location file system .
the kitchen @-@ card groups informs about the group &apos;s group of selected users . the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the field of primary group . furthermore , the user can be member in other groups by mark them in the large field .
the dialog characteristics of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the menu user or group or click the matching button in the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group is an@@ alogue .
with this module you can install the L@@ IL@@ O System S@@ elec@@ tor to remove and modify the boot system , remove the time up to the boot operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify ,
