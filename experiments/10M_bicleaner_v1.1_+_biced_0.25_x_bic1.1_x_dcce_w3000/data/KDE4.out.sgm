<seg id="1">The module website can be found in the & Konqueror; menu under extras. select from the list's output and target language.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of this text is selected, only this part will be translated into the whole & URL;</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is only very rudimentary. babyfish produced in the best case a gross translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, no important decisions should be made on the translations without having to review the translation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated on the babyfish site itself, where you can insert a translated text directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; includes various modules for & Konqueror; despite its small size they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of & conqueror; by making them available more easily.</seg>
<seg id="6">For further information on the use of & Squeror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual at & Konqueror;.</seg>

<seg id="11">The module focuses (also called folder filters) you can arrive in the & Konqueror; menu bar with extras. with the module you can filter & conqueror; 's current working directory on different types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM component in the & Konqueror; to use extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the straight document. as a default, the display begins with the root content of the document, example: the element, all the other nodes are subelements of this root's node.</seg>
<seg id="13">Module & FSView; for & Konqueror; represents another view for objects with the MIME-Type / directory with local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbolic and text messages so as to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The distinctive feature of & FSView; consists in a screened folder-hierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree-map graphically. each object is displayed by a rectangle, whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must feature that the sum of the size of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView, the size of a file or folder, the size of a folder, as the sum of the size of the entries is determined by it. thus, large files, even then can easily be recognized when they are far down in the folder hierarchy. thus, & FSView can be seen as a graphic and interactive version of the & UNIX.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treatographic exposition represents a rectangle which represents a file or a folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles of meaningful colours and lettering settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The colour of a rectangular area, which is inserted over view colour mode, can display either depth for the light detection of the putty or the illustration of a different file name such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the appropriate file or folder. for each property you can specify, if enough space to display is available or if the surface area may be used by restrictions on the sign of the Trevor). besides, you can set the relative position of the lettering in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">When performing algorithms for treemaps, the area should be respected that the area is proportional to the size of the item. at Treatin & FSView; this purpose is not always shown to provide the casing entries of the entries and this framework require space, which then lost the subordinate orders no longer. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle square is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How split the area of an item for the subordinate entries is provided, the implementation is left up. on this occasion, it is for the complained boxes and for the avoidance of space losses by the means always divide the areas such as quadrants that are as square. the best methods on this are lines, columns, or recursive dissectorment.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimal shown area for an entry of the menu item. instead, a smoking pattern in the area of the parent item is drawn to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally & FSView was designed as a small review and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widget, which was developed for the application of KCachegrind.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera records will be made available to you so that you can connect to your digital camera and download their photos directly in & digitised. more than 1000 digital cameras will be supported by means of library services. of course, each medium and every card lesbian is supported by your operating system, with & digitised, working together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digitization; contains a fast image processing with basic image processing tools. you can use these to view your photos, comment, evaluate and correct. the processing capabilities can be easily extended with KDE Image plug-ins (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digicame; easy to use is it makes use of professional skills available. it works completely in the 16-bit color space and all the available modules support the raw converters using purple, DNG-Export and ICC-colour administrative workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with significantly more metadata, such as & eg; on the camera or the lens, which can be searched for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs are also digitization; an open source project. that means, it is dependent on the assistance of the end users. they should therefore report issues and improvements.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digitization: tries to make the milking of problems or suggestions for making them as easy as possible for them. this opens a dialog with a underlined link. if you use these links, your web browser opens a page in the error system. all necessary information is listed here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digitization: is a project supported by a community. i.e., the user and developer came to each other. if you came to a regular user mailing list by & digitization. however, you may ask questions to other users of & digitization. however, you will be able to answer questions about other users here. however, in this mailinglist is English spoken, you should therefore be powerful this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digitization page to visit the news about shared versions and other information about & digitization.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to take part in & digitised, is the registration in the developer mailing list. guidance to log in the developer's mailing list for & digitization;.</seg>
<seg id="64">If you start & digitization; for the first time start, you will be asked where to store your pictures and your database. you can choose a local, remote or remote folder, or simply click the folder icon symbol to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, data abnk is stored. this path will remain equal to all folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later, you can add as many folders as you wish. & digitised, you will additionally use as an Albenign library. settings digiputam.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder, the pictures contains, as a base folder. & digicode; considers any subfolder as an album. no picture will be changed. during the passage of the folder you will get a progress show like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digitor came; durse recurt the librarian in all its depth. you cannot finish any subfolder, unless it list in hidden folder. this can be done by an extraordinary folder and checking out one point in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you'll notice that the albums in My Albends do not take photos as symbols. you can change the copies of the album and put it on the folder symbol. this will then be used as an album icon. further details can be found in the albums icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you configure the base folder, you can set in & digitised, your digital camera. afterwards, you should learn how to use My albums and my keywords list to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">RohdateiSupport: if you use the raw mode of your camera, you may also use it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the context of Crucid support.</seg>
<seg id="72">How you set up this and work with shell files is described in the sections of Roh-Decoderm and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera records will be made available to you so that you can connect to your digital camera and download their photos directly in & digitised. more than 1000 digital cameras will be supported by means of library services. of course, each medium and every card lesbian is supported by your operating system, with & digitised, working together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. the camera then appears as a disk drive. the camera can also be realized through the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digitization: use ProPhoto 2 to communicate with digital cameras, which has an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras. photo2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely spread protocol created by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to machines and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with calculator. since photos in general are large files and transmissions on the serial port, this connection has been deprecated. & digitised, supports these cameras and conducts the transmission of images with photo2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgmental 2 must have been created with libexchange support. EXIF support is not required by some libgmental 2 camera types in order to read the thumbnails. if the EXIF support is not available in libgine 2, you will be able to admit precedents or the production could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things about & digitization is how easy it can extend its functionality by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image plug-ins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common modular structure for & digitization. to develop KPhotoCD, Showimg and Gwenview. the objective is to provide the modules for all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as it can also be a user. your advantage is that it's much simpler, & digitization; by writing a small modul to add a function when the changes came into & digitised, even to perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either switch the sides with & LMB; remove or switch to full-screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Moving and drop off images works everywhere: you can take a picture in another part of the tree build, about the horizontal separation line or another application window. the only constraint is that a picture can't be in keywords, date list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file selection allows you to lift the wigs to you: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, movies and audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the toolbar. thus, the filament works on the filename only when this ind is displayed symbolic view as well. what fields will be displayed can you configure in the dialog's settings.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view on your photosets. these albums can be sorted by the folders, where they were stored on the hard disk, according to the name of their collection in the allocalized properties or after the date, on which the album was first created, sorted. the date can be modified in the properties of the album.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can scan the photo directly into an album. you can also scan the photograph directly to an album. choose the album importer of the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="87">To move or move a picture from one album to another one, you can move the photo with your mouse on the target album and drop it down. you can also move the image by moving or copying them. simply select all photos and move it to the target album.</seg>

<seg id="89">Albuquer- Collections: are a method to highlight your albums, so you can select your photos by selecting from the toolbar or view albums. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can make this in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons, average, neuester: this set the date on that of the oldest, the latest image or the average of the album. first, first tries to calculate the average of the pictures from its EXIF data. if this fails, instead the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">If you first opened an album in & digitised, the first image will be selected as a icon for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; My Albenlistequot; This is to help you remember the photos of the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>

<seg id="145">What is a digital analysis - away from the process? digital drawing is considered every part of the process that was taken up to the final issue and the permanent storage. each of the photos takes, scanned or digital photos, introduces a form of digital inventory. however, most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool to secure a plan and practical advice on how to secure your pictures, protect, protect and use photos. we consider downloading, re-designate, remove, regrouping, backup, backup, streamlining, optimize, waiting, waiting, and export of image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; digal inventory is placed on, indexed, categorized, minimized, designs, transformed, ready-assembled, and exports material that have a monastic or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is provided in accordance with your definition data that will provide information about or using any information provided by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you don't even need more than 1000 photos on your machine, then you don't even know how many photos you have, then you definitely don't use & digitization.. the approach to store metadata in a database as well as in image files guarantees very quick search and a secure archiving to access you with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you do and need to know before you're getting around into your system is building information structure unlike your computer. you must decide whether other access to your photos have to be saved or on a network drive, etc. please note that you eventually have to switch to a larger drive.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you'll be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly through your storage place. if you have enough photos on the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg. 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; use. then export a folder for images that you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements like versioning the photos, archiving, working practices, constants of pictures on different topics and a large number of all. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% of work files will have and you will not want to re-organise your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">Which types of files fit together? the separation of data types makes the stacking process easier. separate new old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplify a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you're looking for an original or a derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the option metadata to be saved in the file page of metadata in & digis. it ensures that Exif- and IPTC data can be written into the file. if you forget this, then you can save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the relevant item on the menu album.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what if you want to change? to add a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes, these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now begin the real work, as you should now select any photo keywords, marking and evaluation. of course, you can select all the images that require the same attribute and then set the value. you start best with the rating or the ranking. this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos while further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now let us communicate with keywords, keywords or categories as you continue with other programs or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then, & digitised, automatically insert the tree for you. converting the hierarchy inside the tree is no problem and can simply be done by pulling a subtree on another. the changed keywords will be checked by & digitised, and while the sub-trees are persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata transforms itself. this is a very rough representation as each block of metadata in truth consists of many sections. filenames and calender dates are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough the keywords - the next section refers to marking or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to see most nobody to see your photos just, you want to share it with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are certainly interested in how your photos will arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you consider it closer you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say you this the Landeplatz of Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing is. wow! you begin to dream of associations, memories, the historic period of time is again present, you might even hear the silence. the caption has changed your perception of this panoramas.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who consider your photos the title is perhaps more important than the picture itself to produce an interest. if you show pictures, you should transfer a story. remember, the key is to transfer to Him through the motif you are moving has to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine when a picture is not perfect, if it has the strength only to work with a lettering for himself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digitization; you can use as much text as possible, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as lettering. you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time. KDE, you can even tell your images in the lettering and / or the title of the web-system system. so you have to tell the story so for the opening of the web-system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find in another city without navigation system? was it not a tedious Planet in front of Googleam? good, because with pictures the train of spatial presentation now starts with speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities that exploit the geoloalization are already innumerable and will continue in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can open your travels with Google Earth. you can then also download photos at reception. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc., with the googlemaps.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a vocabulary with copyright and describes the practice to use copyright laws to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, thus also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the furnishings of & digitization came; as information deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creators and writers): this field should include your name, or the name of the person who has created the photo, e.g. to protect the photographer's identity, then the name of a company or organisation may be used. after which this value has been saved, it should not be changed. this field does not support commas or semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Authortitle (synonym for editor): associated with the author. examples of this field contains the photographer, photographer, freelance photographer or Independent photographer. since this is a note to the author's field, this field has to be completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for provider): use the provider for identifying who the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photograph is listed here for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then those organizations can be listed here. if the image is a bearing photo, then the group / agency provides the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It's very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although this can not provide protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computer can delete, delete or change the solution to this problem are digital watermarks. for individuals, this protection is only very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is extremely important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermarks is unique per image. & digitization; in the near future there will be such a module for stackable processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Themes: plate, plate, turnaround, lapses, ECC, transmission errors, aging of the storage media, restoration, redundancy, desasteraction, age, size, spread superstitions, spread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we do not talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire. these types of losses are the same which can also happen in traditional paper snapshots or negatives. this section deals with problems with the mentioned new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data collection in the world, has some interesting statistics which reasons a data loss has.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, those cautious but you cannot buy CDs and DVDs in archival quality. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archives. there are offers above gold coated DVDs, and dollar; 2 the piece which claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself. whether you believe it is in your surveying room.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you can use good discs and good shooting devices and take them in the right way. the best DVD capsized equipment are not significantly more expensive than the cheapest but you can write much more reliable. therefore, it is therefore getting the right choose.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to mistakes, even if you have just been written. therefore, use a control mechanism to protect yourself. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control. despite this massive protection they age through chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs there is a favourable program called IsoBuster which seems to do wonders amongst CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but there are also similar applications to read the defective data from damaged floppies, harddisks, flashes, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs appear to save the formant war against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disk can save 50 GB and therefore nearly sixty volumes the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that is said to CDs and DVDs was obviously also applied to the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good reception desk on high-quality media in a not propriate format. simply read the media with a description, date & author features and after that in a clean, dark yellow and before animals protected place. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can be read through the media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Discos keep your statistics for yourself. your manufacturer's-may include a new disk, but not the data. Google has a large field study on the error mechanisms of HDDs available on this topic: disfault</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief, Disks keep the longest when you operate in the temperate area of 35 ° C up to 45 ° C. at low Temperature, the most common error-item, SMART may not notice this error. some of the SMART failures announce the immediate immediate emergency. these are particularly lesbikers and abandonment periods. the expected life time amounts between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is the overall loss of losses due to overvoltage. of course, you can also have data loss due to an electricity failure before you backup the files, but these losses normally can be made without big problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical equipment does not account much, this can decrease in devices with computer chips and high speed processors. these can cause heavy damage. at your computer these anomalies have blocked keyboard, complete data loss, hardware replacement, destroyed motherboards and other defects. therefore, protect yourself from the unavoidable results in a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against rapestips is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbed a part of the energy-heat and the rest is det. it is usually available in the form of a steel bar. remember, however, that not every stateckerbar also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should pay attention to it that he offers the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also be careful to protect the protection against lightening and thus protects the properly attached devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">As an overvoltage each cable may use to your computer, you should note that also all peripherals which are connected to your system. this also applies to phone pipelines and cable modems since also included a phone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity options for the coaxial cable of cable-modems and TV menu.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are designed specifically for notebooks and therefore contain very small and you also contain the protection for the modem. so you're ideal for travel.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection your system protects against smaller fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete breakdown. even an exit from a few seconds can cause the loss of irreplaceable data. therefore, it can be useful to invest in a fragile power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">Besides the protection from overvoltage, these devices may automatically transfer cordless energy. this gives you the possibility to store your data and run the system ordered again. if you buy a USV then you should be sure that they comply with the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the attached software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Concern you the potential risk that your billing system is exposed and compare its security at blackout with the cost of avoiding this. a high quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 40 get. this is only a small price difference when you remember how well your machine is protected by it. at the end you should always remember all the cable before you go to the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service. with the right configuration you can integrate it as drive under & Linux; Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup target for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are, however, very expensive compared to the hard drives, but very expensive - 40 GB of dollars, 75 per year and 400 GB costs. 500. in addition, you have to send the data about the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general secure solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo-community 23hq.com provide online store services that are limited to photos. your free memory is not available in full resolution online. the professional variant will provide you more available, in case of Flickr you will get unlimited memory, which should be checked in reality first.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the perspective of data security, the Web-solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies is available in the offering to secure and a shared memory. thus, they are desasterproof.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine. all transmissions are susceptible to transmission errors. the filesystem and btrfs make at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive safely.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one says when a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all of these disturbances remain undetected until you have no protection for it. nobody seems to have no protection for it. nobody seems to have thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a significantly safer data path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power parts are another source of transmission loss as they create interactions within the data streams. on normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not currently affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors each year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle records on low levels and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL licensed license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is soon also available for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with its sub-resolution file system. it is still in the Alpha status. it uses the same protection mechanisms that are used and is also available for & Linux; it is not yet part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Underestimate this not! these two factors are for 86% of the data loss in the notebook and 46% responsible for the workload systems. at Notebooks, the proportion of thefts is already 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most of the seas. it results in a lower damage, such as theft or replacements. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; has been no longer seen for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal, better than ext3, routing, JFS and XFS, to call the comets file systems. a very good English articles can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and loss of data: wrong, just the speed of the investigation process in a sudden break during an operation is higher and a indefinable status will be avoided. if a file was not completely saved before the problem came up, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: wrong, theft, and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings of fundamental physical limits. it is that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and drugs characterize for all types of light-sensors are not far away from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go into the direction of 10 megapixel and the end result would be worse for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras did your limit at 10-12 Megapixel. for higher resolution you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or bigger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">So do you get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so do not make anyone else responsible for data loss. thus, 6% of all PCs are often affected by any loss of data. so you can easily back up your data according to a plan and test this backup before you do something more dangerous than the reinstallation of your operating system, the exchange of plates or the sizes of harddisks.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups on an external USB drive every day. if, then one day, a flash suggests you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster is falling locally and destroys a lot. forget aircraft unhappiness: fire, water, electricity, children and thefts are dangerous enough for your data. they usually concern a whole room or the complete house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore disaster-prevention always means a not local storage. bring your backups the stairs, to the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as stated above, a common reason for a loss of data despite securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files that are to be secured. it is a snapshot of a history, and represents a complete copy of one point in time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential security: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup has been made. creates a complete snapshot of the two time points: one of the total-to-end backup and that of the last differentiations.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since last backup has been made. you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup was made. this backup comes the next one with the exception that it only cured and is not constant.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool you can easily set up on your machines. in contrast to script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer-script copied rsync only the difference of files that were really changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase security on ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important pictures directly after you have stored them on your computer to a DVD or other visual medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure leaves you enough time to discover losses and restore it. at the same time you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. in the end, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot of for at least a month and a snapshot of each month. every additional thinner should be done manually after you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, stored in the image file stored IPTC information, association XMP files, original, memory, scalability, media, re-find pictures and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual devices,..., use of Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable images can survive the next 40 year that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood and youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable from your nature, you need to consider everything today. unfortunately, there is no other option as a certain alertness to leave. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system are backwards. the less variants you have used in the past, the more easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or switching to open standards which are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is nowadays for everyone. so if you have an old system that is important to reading your pictures, then preserve it and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: each time you change your computer architecture, your memory and safety technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the ability to change a system in its size. this means actually getting bigger.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you plan the scalability with you and want to enlarge the area that you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition. with * nix systems such as & Linux, you can copy this area and shift it to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command that your new record was detected by the system, but do not hang them up.</seg>
<seg id="235">/ dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source; parted resize / dev / sdc & dollar; size of the record in MBO; # operates with ext2.3, fat16, 32 and tanfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of retanfs if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software can read, then you can create them yourself. this task will be made from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">Gif is a proprietary, patented format that is slowly disappears from the market. therefore, it should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was developed as an open source standard designed to replace GIF. it can save a lot more. it is losers, supports XMP, extruder and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG may need gamers and chromatical data for improved color information, but not as many as TIFF required and a slow maturity. this format will we recommend you to save your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as picture format. TIFF may be stored into uncompressed form or in a container with a loss-free compression rate (deflate). it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. with some cameras, you can store your pictures in this format. therefore, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digitale Negative file format is developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed by Adobe Systems. DNG is already available on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using metadata. DNG is already available for DNG already and we hope that the competitors of Canon and Nikon will use it sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. the file information is enabled with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; saved the for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive a original of your shot, mostly in the raw-format, to archived. XMP, however, because the metadata changes separately from the image file. therefore, you should consider if you use DNG as container and put everything there together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to compatible online metadata standards that involve a large area of use and modelling, discussion and collaborative work in DCMI communities and the DCMI tasks, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a far-reaching acceptance of metadata and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the ticket lesbian or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera to use, you can use it as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a finely editing process, you can use external programs. if you edit the pictures again with & digitised, then you should add the metadata again. these have some circumstances cut off from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for the copyright with a digital watermarks. simply export it to Webgalas, bode in MPEG, use in contact sheet, print & etc.</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digitised. in the section adding a photo to an album you can add a description, as you have photos which you already have on your hard drive, but you can add many advanced settings to importing images to your allocate database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digitization; to use, connect these with the machine, turn the camera on the ad mode, and turn it on. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect it with your camera. for some cameras, this may take a while. if the connection is made, a skill indicator appears at the bottom and thumbnails will be available. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol for file data is displayed for each file, photos, movies, music etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you might need the camera information about each entry. with the page features and metadata from the camera interface you can see the characteristics of one item or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file characteristics and the photo information stored internally by the camera. an icon shows that the image is not downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras did not make all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider Metadata shows the internal metadata such as EXIF, manufacturer notice, GPS etc., the same as the metadata bar on the main window of & digitization. please note that metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is click on the button to download and then download the selection from all. this invites all photos from her camera to a single album in & digitised. in downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the photos were downloaded safely to an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can only select the desired ones with the default options of & kde; once you have selected the photos, use the button download and then download the selected button. the button chosen will download as long as you selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New download is available. these pictures have not been downloaded by & digitization. in this case, the new images are marked with a star in the preview of it. if you choose this option, of course, only the new images are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you use the buttons All or downloaded the buttons, appears a dialog, with which you can select the target album, displayed in which the photos are sorted. the list of existing albums is shown, as regular folders. select the finish album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have selected the home album, press OK, and & digicame; invites the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once, by delete the button delete. if you only want to delete some, you must first select it and delete it afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there is no possibility to recover from the camera, restore it. so, the photos are not removed in the dustbin of & kde; so they should check carefully before you delete them from the camera. if you want to completely delete them from the camera. if you want to completely delete the camera system, then you should do so much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filenames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names. the filenames are usually again recycled, after the photographs have been deleted from the camera. therefore, it can be useful, the date and time when the picture was taken to integrate into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirror-based subcategories. if you use this latter option, a folder per day will be automatically created.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer opens three further options that are performed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two are related to the data about the author standard Autoridentity. if you choose this, the corresponding entries are copied from the EXIF data into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct the date & time available for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want another disk-format as the standard format, you can e.g. in the processing field the prefix photo -% Y-%% H:% M:% S. turn it on the option date & time. for further modifications you should read the help Command Proftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera filename, you have the option to change the filename in lowercase letters, or case letters, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digicame; for a photo, is displayed below the name that displays the camera in the preview. your settings for rename are saved and automatically used when you open the next time the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digitization; can provide any information about the orientation of the camera to the point of recording, to carry out a automatic spin during downloading. not all cameras will provide this information. in the sidebar metadata section, you can read more details about the information that your camera is embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually turned on, and if your camera doesn't generate this information, the photo is in original orientation. if you want to switch off the automatic spin turn, use the button Advanced and select the automatic turn on the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera records information about the date, which the photo has been made available, can use & digitization. these subjects are based on the image data. all pictures with the same date are downloaded in the same subalbum. not all cameras will display this information. in the sidebar meta data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally off, and in this case, & digicame; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to switch this option and select the option data-based subdirectories at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the button download. select then upload. the file optional dialog & kde; appears in which you can select the files uploaded, which is to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the Standard & kde; methods select.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the selection is done, asks & digitised, you where the images are to be loaded up. a folder-selection dialog appeared for the camera. select the folder you want to download and press OK to load the upload. the images won't be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general concept in this document. thus, a position is meant to be displayed in longitude and latitude. identifying the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to scrub an area through automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planner, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten later on where exactly the photo was made, you can send a postcard to another & digicode. if you want to send a postcard to another & digicode readers, who would like to locate the location of the photos, or just save this aspect, it's good to get the position of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data arrive in the image? first, you should know that exiv2 are many GPS data fields such as direction, sepulelites and cardholder's referenced. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via a COIPI module for geographic assignment (manual) and last over the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there are currently no camera, which has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few that work with GPS receptors. either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: coyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR rioh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or psbabel. you need to save these data in gpx format as this is the only format supported by the module to geographic assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are several programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract data from images and from GPS and correlate it. on the following page you can get the same under & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsphoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, then you can use this script that works with the ExifTool of Phil Harvey. it uses the signs that are created by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European road cards. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all the navigation details for Europe.</seg>

<seg id="284">Action can be selected based on an embeet preview or picture editing. you are laying down the standard behaviour of & digitised, notes if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the Standardized and copyright data. this data is automatically selected in the appropriate IPTC data fields, if the option is selected by downloading the camera system. also with a database synchronization, these data are written in the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Authortitle is a synonym for fibre-footer: this field should be the professional photographer of photographer. these can be designations like e.g. Anchained photographer, freelance photographer or more independent, commercial photographer. since this is a detailed description of the author, this also has to be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the photo program like e.g. Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be registered here as this is the image of the other & quot; anbietenquot;. if the image is a bearing photo, the group or agency that the picture should be available here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data into the appropriate IPTC Felber. it is achieved that metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of & digitised. these metadata also have other programs and can be imported and imported into & digitised.</seg>
<seg id="289">Images can be saved as an embedbug (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments that you embedded in the pictures. this can also be read by other imagery in the pictures. caution: when images, which are already included, these texts will be oversubscribed.</seg>
<seg id="290">The page Settings contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse cursor in the main window above a file rests. depending on the model chosen, this information will be displayed or not.</seg>

Albuquerner who has none of these extensions, ignored by & digitised; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Refresh right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The configuration of the luminaire of & digitization; can then be set on this page. each time you can then open the luminaire. however, some images do have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. the option & quot; In the full size ladenquot; you should only use on fast machines. if you have one, then you can obtain a better view results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the image editing a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can select the toolbar if you use the toolbar in full-screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or light colour in the picture. these colors will be fixed here. in the image processing this image can be used with F10 and F11 and be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma-Subsampling, it means that images are coded in a higher resolution of luminance than in color formations. please read this article in Wikipedia about the closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the setting PNG compressing you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation is not reduced the image quality since PNG used a loss-free algorithm. if you have a quick machine, you can set this value to high compression. thereby, 1: a low and 9 high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option TIFF files compressed, you can turn the deflate -compression laser for TIFF images. this reduces the size of TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality, as the deflate algorithm calculates hard-free.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the attitude towards loss of loss JPEG-2000 files you can be lossfree. even if you have been the lossy setting, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG. when this paragraph has been written, metadata had not yet been supported, but it was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the previous versions of & digitised, image processing was just a picture for photos. currently it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulation of your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard sampling is that all green pixels are equal. if the low-line green pixels of the CCD sensor is responding to sensitive collisions in output. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimum loss of details. this option draws the picture a little soft, eliminates the 2x2 gene pattern using the VNG- or the AHD video method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white axis is used immediately by the camera. otherwise, the automatic colour balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the whiteboard is not set. standard is it a solid colour balance, that was photographed on a white map that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that inferior images in four steps more details in the spotlight. for other cameras, this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the miracter, so the parts of your images are burned down, because of the inability of your camera to capture the Spitlichés. use the setting colours generates some unusual results, as it shows the pointed-light in various rosatches. finally, you can try some parts of the missing information from the mirrers to reconstruct.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast satiated as green and red. & digidie therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red shares of the not saturated blue pixel. obviously, this is a question how much color or whites you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">When you select the option reconstruct, you get the possibility to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and / should therefore be adapted individually for each picture individually.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the luminance value according to your taste. you probably need to put it slightly higher than standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of the & digitization. to keep the time for the DemosaBicing, you should proceed more conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demosaBicing-algorithm is a digital image process to get a complete picture from the sub-filtered image sensor which has many cameras and is known from a matrix colorfully pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA Interpolation or Farbreconstruction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digipack came; and Dcraw make you three alternatives available: Bilinear, VNG Interpolation and AHD Interpolation (Variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. VNG Interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color-initiation of your lenses you can put the red and blue-proofreaders here. this is certainly the best method for a color configuration, as you are performed while the shell is implemented.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to get there again. there are also LCMS and digitization. information like the color informations of a farms in the other are possible to translate the colors as accurately as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">The behavior questions, if an image is opened in image processing, will start the 'color' module with shell files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Colour profile folder: here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where all of your profiles have been saved. & digicode; investigates this folder during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to deposit. everything can be changed in the opening of the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The view view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures and do not manage the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be used to the camera buyer and model that you are using. not all profiles are included in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not have any color TV or gamers. currently, the craw Gamma does not have to perform for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means you must carry out the color binary yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are more options like the Soft Proof profile to emulate what your image would be given back from one device. this is very useful before you print images because your printer can operate a smaller color area as your camera and some colors therefore very saturated. this could you fix manually, instead of relying on the flashes's algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious which color-profile is intended for them for what is. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. therefore, here are a table of cameras and profiles which fit together. of course this answer is unofficially:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension makes the style for the goal: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portraits and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image Plugin interface. it is an interface that can be supported by a number of & kg; image concerned and image editing. many modules support that were written to work with each program, which supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you'll see a list of available modules. select the one you want to use, and these will then be loaded by & digitised. these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and additionally you will find some also in the context menu of the foreskin.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short-commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under settings short-warranted.</seg>
<seg id="324">For further information (in English) about KIPI-modules you can get via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals for the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slides should be simple to understand. the upper limit regulates the time between the image outings, usually 4-5 seconds well. the other cross-fields turn the metadata one or which ends at the bottom of the images displayed during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera properties displayed on the left of a list of all the currently supported cameras. on the right hand there is a button Automatic recognition, which is working on the computer. if you want to use this, make sure that the camera is properly connected, switched on and in image mode. beneath these are the port settings. currently, serial ports, USB- and USB / FireWire mass storage devices are supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path for USB- and FireWire- (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) -mass storage-canned camera from the camera screen. you have to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / retooling, where you adjust your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digitization; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, install it in the ad mode, and turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check if & digitised you see; the camera will automatically recognize it. if not, you can set camera models and port manually. after you set up your camera, your camera will appear in the menu camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera, and it's displayed in the menu cameras of the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can insert it here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option of verifying dialog for the moving from &gt; images in the dustbin, you can set the conversation of & digitised, deleting a photo in an album. in the sections deletion of a photo and deleting a album you find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right side bar can be used in silent by & digitization; if you use the option to apply changes in the right sidebar without residual questions, otherwise you need to apply changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also set up the welcome screen of & digitization. these will accelerates the start-up process of & digitization.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting can be searched for new photos & digitised, the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos; this prolongs the start time of & digitised. if something from the base folder has been deleted, asks & digitised, you whether to delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different shades are in & digitised; they are used to adjust the main window to suit your tastes. these settings can select you under settings design from the toolbar. a preview of available designs will be considered below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for publication, you will find more information about it in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digitization; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use these to view your photos and to improve and improve. image editing can be started by one click with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the item View / Edit menu.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures. some of them are available as modules in & digitization. therefore, they may not be part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules you can set up in the picture editing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the file name, current date number, enlarging factor, and the current size picture shows.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar on the top edge, including the toolbar for quick access to the most common functions required.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of picture editing changes your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before saving file saving or saving the button save from the toolbar. note that you cannot restore your original photo once you saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should possibly create a copy of your image before you change it. you can save it with File save.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the filesystem path or re-establish the button. you then lose any change that you have done on the photo since the last time.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any action of picture editing can be reversed or restored. the last action you can undo by selecting machining and recreated by selecting machining from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you often use this, you should make the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to the refine and Ctrl; -umold-Z to reproduces.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you select the & LMB, using the back-back or Restore button in the toolbar you can press a right-click menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all the actions in between are reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you start editing picture, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigational features in toolbar, image high, picture down or the entries in the menu file. if you have made changes to the current photo, you are asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo in and out of zooming in which you use Ctrl; Mauser or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the menu-menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can select this button in the toolbar: enlarge factor automatically.</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode. you come to the normal view where you use the Esc button. usually, the toolbar is displayed. if you do not want this, you can call it in the dialog dialog of & digitization. you can view this section for editing content.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select the image in the File menu and get the Standard & kde; press dialog. you can adjust here the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or whole sentences. all image boards can be printed from your choice. you only need to select the images using the standard method and select from the menu album exporting printing material. if you follow the assistant you just need to hit your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digientered; main window has a side bar on the right edge, which provides important information and promotions available for the selected images. the same page bar is available without the navigational figs, also available in image processing. it is displayed when one of the five horsemen is clicked on:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multifaches clicking on the same rider can be appearing on the sidebar or disappear again into the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the marking view you can type or insert marking with unlimited size. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captures are copied into the EXIFT and IPTC- fields to allow you to be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut after 2000 characters and special characters are reversed. if you want to use the IPTC appeal box in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on you either use the button or simply switch to the next picture, the confuses will then be stored.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the use-button, there is a button. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata to the files. however, this will always be done if you have selected a metadata set that is always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review indicates a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in seeking and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars on the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select it and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC field. coding follows the diagram in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keywords will display a search box to the filtering the keywords, the keywords and a drop box with the before in this & digicode; -session set the keywords.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword is dynamically adapted to the search word. you can restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is a further relief in entering keywords at a picture series. if you have entered different keywords, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by markers of the appropriate cross areas in the tree. all the keywords of an image are stored into the IPTC field Keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">When multiple images are selected in the main view and choose a keyword in the keywords, this only applied to the highlighted picture and not applied to the entire selection, if you wish to provide a selection with a keyword, please refer to the keywords filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The page timeline filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window. usually, the left sidebar with their album, file, keyword and viewpoints are used. if in addition one or more keyword filter is used from the right, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and discard. suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view. if the keyword does exist, you can simply drag it out of the right side bar and put on the selection. thereupon, a dialogue window you ask if you want to place the buzzword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the top example shows the main window showing the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword is no keywords, which is reduced the amount of three images. they were pulled with Ctrl + a, and after that a keyword is drawn from the right bank-tree to the choice and put it there. a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be switched from different settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule and have created and notice that it should be one or its needs, you can easily change it with double-clicking on the text and on the rule section.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry to be searched for in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, picture, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string, set already in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set up a Advanced search for all the elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need the cross-box at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. see the options as follows:</seg>

<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly made it up & digitised, s specified implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow, the colors that vary from your camera or scanner is a predictable deviation from the actually photographed and scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can reach that the colors displayed on your monitor of your camera or scanner and the colours you print or publish in the Web out of your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the topic comes out on colour management, everyone wants to know what buttons it wishes to press. unfortunately, the meaning of this tutorial is made available to you on every point of the image processing workflow. the meaning of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about colour management. in addition, you should make links with more deep information to make your own informed decisions and thus obtain the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">When your workflow offers all the criteria listed above, you do not have to worry about colour management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You will work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB farwers. (further information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other picture expenditure is by email or the Web where sRGB of de-facto standard is.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if SRGB works so well and makes life for everyone so simple, why should you use another color space and thus have thoughts about colour management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the Limitation of sRGB compared with the colors that we really can see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the horseshoe region, and the colors in the sRGB farms, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-Dimensional Representation of sRGB with some larger colour spaces, then visit Bruce Lindbloom excellente site and click on info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Must I kallify my monitor when I decided to work only in the sRGB Farel?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you're working in sRGB-brewers or not, you must cut your monitor callibritish, since sRGB works out of your monitor. so when you work in the RGB of sRGB, you must either use your monitor on the sRGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool presents five automatic corrections available, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before you try a further manual work.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, lowering, automation and contrast expand the menu of correcting automatic corrective correction automatically from your colors the best to make. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalized: this method holds the luminance control over the entire image so that the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shading. this function is often a magnet correction for images that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">The same: this method jusherded the lightness factor of the colors of the selected image, allowing the histogram of intention to increase the same number of pixels. sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contraction of a picture, sometimes it produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that can either causes wonders in one image or destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic reckless: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue-channel. it detects the dark and bright boundary tones and jushed the red, green- and blue-channels on the complete histogram.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast expand: this method improves the contrast and light of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest value in the widest possible area and a retinting of all values in between. this is only visible in washed pictures and can be a good correction for poor photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white-comparison of & digicame; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the tinting straight out of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-axis-correction is slightly limited because of a color-lift with 8-bit per color. so, if you can perform too far from the original image, areas with overload mode can occur. if you can perform the white axis in the raw mode, which in 16-bit mode works, so your ways to correction is better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a tinal cutover of copyright protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it via the menu-application colors white abidentically to the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The showcase can be adjusted in size. on the left you can see both the original image as well as the preview of the target image. the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original screen immediately, it's enough to click the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right above, a histogram appears that dynamically modified as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful because, even in well illuminated images, most pixels with very small Luminescence. with a button you can decide whether any of the three colours or your sum is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your outcome depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or dimming you too.</seg>
<seg id="401">The stat has to play with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press on this button and afterwards somewhere to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the whiteboard. in this way the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">Additionally you can set the whiteboard with the list of presets. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The translusion indicator increases the colors, if more than a color channel of the pixels is overexposed. you will see the combined result in the white axis. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons Save as and shop makes exactly this. each attitude of the white balance you have set allows you to save in a text file and load later again.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button presets puts all the filter values again on their default values and the associated image blade. please note that another photo will be displayed as your original. if you save these neutral settings, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust here the codes of the beprocessed image. 8-bit coding is the widespread JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better for high-quality images. this coding requires also more disk space, calculating time and is onlyonlyonfor the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialogue as the processing of color pictures. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color tone can be performed by the subwindow for the luminaires. a detailed instructions for the use of color profiles can draw the chapter Color Management Rate.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the menu at colors Ton. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time. this is useful when your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and therefore always need the same correction. in the manual for key lasty you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you will find under colours gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The digitization; tool colour effects provides you four colour effects, a solar effect effect, a neon filter, a neon effect and a cutter filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, solar degeneration, also called Sabatier, a effect was created when one completed a partly developed pressure a short flash light and then inverted the image of the picture. the result was a partial negatively of the picture. this tool allows you to finalize this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity control the solar system. at about 50% intensity, the image shows what chemically possible. another raise is finally generated a negative image, that such as not to produce photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of solar effect. the original image is the (1) and the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation effect that it makes a stronger contrasting effect that makes the colours brilliant and glowing. try it simple, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for one of daylight-converted paint movie which is produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors during daylight and high contrasts. however, Velvias strongly saturated color but also some photographs, especially those which are barely reconditioned, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilter simulates Neonlicht against the contradiction. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slipping reps the strength of the neonlight. in large images the filter can spelled the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to correct the color contrasting and the luminosity of the photos. you can for experimenting with the different color leaflets of your photos in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the results you use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can get a photo in bad light conditions, you can get the opposite problem: one too big saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / satiation will be a good choice for satiety instead of increasing it. if you can perform the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool of gravity and the simple leuchforce / contrast / Gamma is the tool Tonefcorrect to improve the exposure. even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated, you need for the use of the Schlate. concrete the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of the intensity values, an histogram, the active edge or the selected area. under the graphs are three slider into it and that can be shifted to change the intensification of the picture. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright side areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to handle is to move the regulator and take care of how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand, the original and preview of the picture can be viewed. the preview is dynamic, with the settings of the image, updated. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be set whether the histogram is shown with a linear or logarithmic Y-axis. for pictures of a digital camera is often the linear display of a constant color. in pictures the large areas of a constant color is dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controllers: the top one for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for medium tones, often called gamers.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colorings can be used in the preview of the original image, in order to automatically detect the input, middle and bright notes. moreover, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Executing: the executing provide the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to modify the outlining as well as in the input data. for example, the compression of the output can be used to create a hidden picture as a background, while something else is in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save and load: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and re-loaded it later. this will be used to Gimp some format.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three colours boxes, the input buttons is automatically regrouped for all shadows, resources and solar panel. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the serial application for red, green-, blue and luminaires.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Surrender indikator option controls all color channels to view over-coated pixels and display you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, that is, you only get the effect in the preview and it's no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of the adjusting of the serial insert applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and Alpha channel, as well as the executable are unchanged. the original image is marked (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand side is displayed half of the original and the target image. the preview is dynamically updated according to your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifying channel: this selection box allows the channel to specify the channel that is changed by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, there are two symbols to switch between a linear and logarithmic view. for pictures that were included with a digital camera, linear mode is the most useable mode. for pictures with large areas of a constant color, linear mode generates a wide couch. in this case the logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you move for example a teventeil to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright sounds are corresponding with darker spears and the image of image is darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red marker. if you want to change this marker in the area you want to change, an appropriate line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is jushed to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve that can be created can be saved in the filesystem and can be loaded later. the file format is the Gimp cam format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three colours buttons, you automatically create the checkpoints of the curve for all channels of the shadow, middle and sunny. enable the color pipette that you want to use and click the original image to set the checkpoints for the red, green-, blue and luminaire curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overlooking Inspeculator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overloaded pixels, you get the combined effect. on this occasion, it is an indicator, that is, you only get the effect in the preview and it's no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo that was corrected in the Luminanzcanal. shadow and sunflower was applied with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected. (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel-mixer of the digitization came; image editing is a tool in order to improve the color channels or change the shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of the pictures. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the canalopbox you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channel by viewing the relative distribution and swing. the left area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be seen as compared to its own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position this in the picture, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are on the right bottom: regulator for red, green and construction allow you to mix these canals. if you can also activate the corresponding color components, since the channel blender then DAS tools for generating great black-white conversions of your photos. try the green canal for black-and-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially if you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color will appear to be a visible smoker that doesn't appear on the same spot in the color canal and their smoking pattern in each channel otherwise looks different. if that's the case, you can improve your monochme conversion in which you reduce the brewers first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Saving buttons and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any mixer settings can be saved for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Surrender indikator option controls all color channels to view over-coated pixels and display you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, that is, you only get the effect in the preview and it's no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue Canal is reprinted. the Luminator option is to be activated. the original image is under (1) and the painted image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white-photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a working step where color pictures can easily be converted to the computer. also with a set of film-rollers.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford TP2 Super, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film-load with a green lomfilter. this looks good at all the scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky. thus, similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filter: simulated a black / white film load with a unique ruler filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air snaps. therefore, similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange opter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotfilters: simulates a black / white film-load with a red lime-filter. this creates dramatic follow-effects and can simulate the moon-effects of the day time. therefore, similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film load, with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural shade correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiphaton: creates warm bright and medium tones, while having added a little cold in the womb. this is very similar to the process of getting a printing and re-development in an epiblast. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the digitization; tool texture can apply to decorative textures on one image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, no matter whether it is a colorfull or not, you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop kind portrait shot from enlarged points or how a mural on a wall. the menu image editing image paste can be used for it.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right increases the semblance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied in the photo below. the original image is (1) and the altered under (2). the parameters Relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">For digitization; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of an observer in the limits of a photo is no easy task. an opportunity to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier to the contend eye. under picture frame can be started the module can be started from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, you make the desired type of cream for your image. thoroughly fenced with a thin line and a wide framework (ideal for black-white images), abbreviated it with a nice three-dimensional frame of the ideal is for a push-feather and decorative add a ornamental frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the value area for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This will be larger when the frame painting is bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for the print of images, especially if you have used the tool by aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert single-formatted text into a picture of any location. this also goes to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply type the text and place it using the mouse. use text size, orientation, color from the color size and the character set. the larger the image, the larger must be the character set. at the end you simply choose a frame round the text and / or a half-sighted background. already the picture is finished.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting that you choose for your text may be changed until you hit the button 'OK'. once the picture has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the digitemplate; tool template cannot apply a template for an image.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Contemplate's menu image in image processing can be used to lay stencils on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the stencil, there are no restrictions on the size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should add with maximum compressing (9) to the reduction of file size. if you want to add your stencil template; add-mail in English to the & digipack; mailinglist digicame-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you have to put your template folder with the button base folder in dialog. select the folder in which you copied the template files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the stencils, a tree-view that reflects the folder structure of the stencil. the selection of a folder is automatically updated the thumbspout of the stencils automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview, there are three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button is enlarged the image below. it is centred around the position of the mouse. check it with the right mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrunken: this button resized the underlying image below. if you want to apply the template on the entire image, you must reduce the picture accordingly. check it with the right mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the picture below the template. take the image and place it at the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template on your image. the image will then be automatically adjusted to the thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="479">Digitization came; provides three different tools for sharpenalties. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpens is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but created especially in dark areas, grained pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Sharper mask is working at the contrast of the edges of the edges. actually, it doesn't get a bit, it works rather psycho-visual. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it is doing a really good job. the algorithm was taken out of Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is perhaps the best of the three since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most of the digitised images need a correction of sharpness. elements that are smaller than the resolution will therefore be watching a little blur. the same phenomenon can be watching when coloring points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more subsequently to act as normal cameras for private use.</seg>
<seg id="484">With JPEG images frequently a camera has been used internally. images of the raw-format, on the other hand, must always be grilled during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanner support a sharpness filter during the reading of the picture. if you disable these disable, you will get control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by using a photo with the sharpening base. you can sharpens with the checkbox in the course of the menu.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should be careful about this, as the results are not very natural: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also reinforcing the noise. in general, the most useful technique to sharply focus on one image is the tool refocus. in general, you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too cracking. the solution, the image is a little soft to draw. use the tool to draw softened with the menu entry) and experiment with settings. the thumbnail on the right side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blurred blur is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help you edit the image. the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two major parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often create good results and should initially be tried out. an increase in the radius or the amount enhance the effect. if you make the sharpness mask too strong, they will create noises and the impression of grats near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius puts a how many pixels on each side of a channel are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow greater radio. you should therefore find pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurring picture that is being added to the original. thus, the strength of the acuteness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The corpora value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference difference. one can thus define a minimal difference in order for a channel of the filter. thus, areas with a soft switch between the sounds are exempt from the blurred and therefore beauty error in faces, Himmling and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blur masculine filter. the original image is the (1) and the painted image (2). blurred image has been applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a corpora = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The digitization: tool Refocus is focused on an image by enhancing the depth of the field. it used to be used to protect the protected design of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to undo an image & quot; refocused approach; this is a better approach than just trying to sharpens the photo. refocus mostly better results than blur. refocus mostly gains better results than blur. you can start it from the menu by calling colors Refocus in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice the circular Faltung works much better than the Gauß'sche Faltung. the Gauß'sche Faltung has a very long tail, which leads that the mathematical result also depends on the source pixel, which is far from the original pixel's Faltung. in most cases, the Gauß Wiener inverse the Gauß'schen Faltung is adversely affected by the distant pixel. the resulting unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most pictures, the default value should set a good results. you can put a higher value when your image is very blurred, but then pay attention to halts.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the value close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpest effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filters: an increase in the smoker can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0,1 rarely get useful. if the smoker filter is too low, & win; 0 is the image quality very bad. a useful value is 0.03. a high value will add the picture further.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß'sche sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß 's edge. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a value inequal zero, you might also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformative atrix. an increase in the matrix size can create good results, especially if you select great values for the circular sharpening or the Gauß'schen sharpness. however, note that the module is very slow if you choose large values for that parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The storing and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocus parameters that you have set will be stored for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all the cuts, color and Intensifications on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that lots of operations changes that are not immediately visible, but leave later inconvenient artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you are reading images and compress, & eg. as JPEG, you should apply the module to uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, irregular Maskate produces better results than sharpens. this could be caused by blurred masking a larger neighbourhood rather than sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, the blurred masking has to create increasingly artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of the sharply filter. at least, the result of the FIR Vienna Filters is always as good as the sharpness mask. the FIR Vienna filter is often better in handling small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small unfocused picture:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color-screen must be corrected. this picture was taken with an analogous camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light to the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods for sharpness and correction in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator glasses dragons uses the sharpness of the area of the spoilt area, in order to create a more natural Pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The colour tinction allows a adapted color for the Pupille. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool infallible is one of the most highly developed tool to paint not desired artifacts with an unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inkialgorithm has been developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various settings as a starting points to simplify the restoration. the available settings are considered below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to set the filtering settings in a jushing, you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detailled posture [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to a uniform smoothing on the picture. whereas greater values mainly homogeneous regions glats and details are sharp. a value of 0.9 should receive details so that no sharpness is necessary. please note that the detail of detail should always be subordinated.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction Depudency Alpha [0.100]: a small value smoothes in all directions, while keeping a value close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film-body or CCD Rauschen will produce a high value of wave-like patterns. JPEG artifacts are best viewed with a value close to 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth settes [0, 500]: this sets the maximum gradient factor above all else. p then define the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value suitable to the degree of smoking in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter also affects larger structures. the higher the value is set, the more it is smoother, since it is difficult to determine the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm has been going through. usually this is enough 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Winkelgradual entry [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropy Alpha. if Alpha is chosen, it should be small as well. so take care that small angles can produce a long term. thus, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to suit your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Inclusive sstep [0,1, 10]: inclusive downgrade in pixel. you should use the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing, and never exceed 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation: the More quality that you get through the choice of this option is only low. however, it doubles its running time. therefore, we recommend it to it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save as and shop makes exactly this. every setting of image errors can be saved into a text file and re-loaded it later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors correct is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still take very long and a high CPU load gradually pull. you can therefore break the calculation with the button dismantling at any time.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how to remove pictures with little artifacts. the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analogue camera. as you see there is a peculiar black artifact in the foreground, that caused by a bad filming during the trip. the original image is under (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The digitization came; sound reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce tile noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool presents your selectable image filter to remove spots and other artifacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it may also be used to remove sensory cable from the camera or Moivorute; -effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information on sensory cameras from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot shows a typical scene which has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a liquor that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">The following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow Advanced settings can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixels and can blurred the image. the area indicated by the radius is moving over the image and the color in it is smoothes and thus cleared up smaller mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: inspect the edge of the filter at the front. this value sets the pixelabreast to the front. if it will increase the edges of the filter while you change this adjustment. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter images can no longer be obtained and noises can be found again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controlling the edge-accuracy for sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it can be too strong, not the entire noise can be removed or rough tips can occur. put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a watchful noise or JPEG artifacts without losing any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controlled the luminosity of the image. we recommend either colour or luminance to change a picture. these settings do not affect the sample process that is controlled by the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controlled the color-eye of the picture. we recommend either colour or luminance to change a picture. these settings do not affect the sample process that is controlled by the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the Gammatoleranz of the picture. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which typically be stronger, however there is also the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Absorption: controls the adjusting of the phasenjitteriness. this figure defines how fast the adaptive filtering radius is responded to variations of the luminance. if it is elevated the edges are smoother if it can occur on its minimum, smoking and phasenjitter can occur in edges. it can remove casctips and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for the noise reduction you have set, can be stored into the filesystem and will be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how smoking reductions can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected. with (2). the loid reduction was used with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is cracking for your purpose. however, the solution to drawing the picture a little soft, is fortunately much easier than an image. use this tool to draw softened with the menu item, and experiment with the glasses. the template window on the right side of the dialogue shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The digitization came; photo Restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to decrease photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of undesirable artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to show Gauck's sound, film-grain and local errors that appear in digital, original or subsequently digitised images. the smoothing happens along the image outlines and thus receives the content as it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and text composition. the translation process is done with another tool, the brightness correction, has been developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS labs in Caen / Frans and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artifacts reduce that the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas a very far away from it. as a loss of compressing compressionism he generates some compression & quot; artequot; - small standards which are shown in unzipped image. this attitude meant to correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons Save as and shop makes exactly this. each setting of photo-restoration can be saved into a text file and re-loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo-restoration is comparatively very fast at work. but it can still take very long and a high CPU load gradually pull. you can therefore abort the calculation with the button anytime.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can see how a photo with like-shaped noise will be restored.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera recorded on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 Film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the infamous film-grain on the faces. the original image is under (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures was applied to an old color photo created using a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts caused by scanning lights and the photo paper. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digitrack; tool Hotpixel permits Hotpixel of photos showing a CCD camera gem, eight were to be removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, protected by Martin Dicklop.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, puzzling or hot pixels are particularly high-quality raw mode photos an issue since many cameras with JPEG compression over a built-in repression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "this tool can be used to remove & quot;" "" "Pixelquot;" ""; and "" "" bright pixel quot; in a photo with a dark-image subtraction method. "" "" there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel. "" "</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button dark. the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the picture preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">When you have an old digital camera, it's important to record the dark picture directly in connection with new hot or bright pixels through cdrom defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the fitting dark picture to the correct image. note the automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. please note that the wizard notice the last dark image and recharge it automatically in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview help you correct the result within the picture. the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are taken up in all anticipations.</seg>
<seg id="560">Choose an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and results of the movie. then select the best filter method to cross these pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">During: it is procuced an average of the neighbor pixel. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional Interpolation this will be separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear. all pixels that have a distance from 1 to the pixelblock are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default movie method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixelblock are pulled to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1 dim) that is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cuban: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are deducted to calculate a bi-cuban surface (2-dim) or a group of Cuban curves (1 dim) that is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hotpixel correction to a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long irradiation, applied. the original image was magnified to 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The digitization came; Vignettierungslasty is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. subcommands, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Mockwise lenses, especially the middle and large photo format, can often not evenly illuminated the whole sensor area. instead & quot; vignetting quot; (shady) they reduce the corners and edges of the picture by using the light that reaches the sensor there. Telelenses show some circumstances also this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">It also has disadvantages. many Center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 in aperture filter, which makes it impossible to keep the camera with the hand. forged-angle lenses, also with Center filter, an opening of f / 16 or smaller because otherwise undue effects emerge.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the great inscription of today's film and color scanner or graars of digital cameras and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a centerfilter by transforming a equivalent transformation to a raw filter that is applied without this filter. the tool Vignetting corrective the transformation with a centerfilter on a picture. the algorithm has copyright protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controllers you can control the vignetting filter and control the image of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light output damper at the point of the largest density. the standard density is 2,0, which is an optical filter with a aperture set of 1, or randomly a luminosity of 2, escaped. increase the density by a bigger degree of vignetting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminosity, contrast and Gamma Knife: the editing of an image with the vignettierungsid reduces the luminosity of the target image with these options new jus. the controller supply you only positive values, as you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer adjusting of the aim of the target image, let the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma for zero and use the dation from the & digitization; image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction to one image. the original image (1) shows the correct image (1) the corrected image. a luminance and counterbalance was also carried out in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digitization; Linsendistortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. coloured distortions can not be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second indicator covers the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or concise form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third gradient has a similar circuit effect, flap at edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth Grades corrected the remote sites to that of the second Grades. when you combine these two, each geometric distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the distortion second grades. with negative values, tlenticular distortions can be corrected, and positive values of the hoverous distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth Grades. this value works stronger at the edges and in the middle of the picture. for most lenses the 'corners parameter has generalized the opposite sign of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scale the image size and thus leads to a correction first gradient. negative values enlarge while positive the image reduced.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighten up: this value indicates the brightness in the corners of the picture. negative values reduce the brightness of the picture in the corners, while positive values they increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialogs with a preview the version correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used when default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonal or hovershaped correction should be done before all the cuts or size changes. at best, you run this correction as all the first. if you want to re-cut a picture and then perform a tonical correction, the effect would be apparent.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool presents a vertical and horizontal relief line. move it into an important place, such as the sea side or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the tonn- / hovershaped stop using the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a hovershaped gout, the resulting image is black corners. you can remove them with the cutting-tool in the menu transformations, remove from image processing or on the zoom controller of this dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures the tonsilky correction is sufficient. the next logical step for some motives as e.g. recordings from the front, frames and paintings is it the perspective so correct the all angle in picture 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of a tonal correction is applied to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulate infrared movie the Gimpeto.org web page which is available under this URL. the filter reproduces the well known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrared movie, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can set two parameters adapting the granulation and cinematability (ISO). add the option of a movie granularity if you want to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive movie. the ISO-controller changes the quantity of film granulation and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in the transformation. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter colors to reproduce by infrared film, especially the green canal makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white-photos as the color formations are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of an infrared sound effect applied to a landscaping photo from New Zealand. the original image is placed under (1) and the edited image below (2). higher ISO values produce a type of aura in the shutter.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digitization; Filming Filmation is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film-grain images, such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, known to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers of large silver-grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film-grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to get back into the past. if you want to use this specific, gallery-like, sephotographer, granular sight specially in your monochromen photos, you must use these filters.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the controller, the ISO-sensitivity can be calibrated to the control of the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although frequent higher values are needed to be adjusted to ISO-2400. if you need even more Körner, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of film construction effect on a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and I used the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digiage came; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses the copyright protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digiage came; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting. nature images and stills are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controllers to influence this effect. the top select the brush size between one and five out. thicker brushes are better suited for big pictures. smooth control controls the glasses or, from the other side, considers the singularity.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the edited is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smoothing 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digitor came; filter coal-drawing uses color and power gradient, the lines that define the outlines in the drawing are highlighted. pictures of their gradients are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to outline you. this would be good pictures to start with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper one chooses the foundation size and the lower jushes the contrast (glasses).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coherence filter. the original image (1) and the altered picture (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result may be improved by adaptation of the Intensity.</seg>
<seg id="606">The digicode draws; filter Gravity dominates your image in 3-D, as if it has been thrown up in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The digicode draws; filters engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures with a 3-D effect. he works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important of the content. the filter uses the differences between colour and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monary landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth permits the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filtering. the original (1) and the painted image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Shaft blocks 1: divide the image in cells and lets it look as if it is seen through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: similarly to the wave blocks, the image is distorted here in a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate high CPU load. you can abort these effects at any time with the button push.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo in an artwork by means of blurredness effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharper: wipes the image along stone-shaped lines that emanating from a center. this simulates the imsharper a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often in the sport photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radiale Ensharpness: blurred the image by rotation of the pixels around a center. this simulates the blurredness of a three-spinning camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Removal of removal: blurred the image around the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to step back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion sharpness: blurred the image through horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the blurredness of a linear motion, z: B: out of a car or train photograph, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Soft tip: blurred the image soft in the dark and strong in bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or to add a warm and subtle fiddle.</seg>
<seg id="620">Contraceptive: blurred the image by random shift of the pixels and simulates the blurred one of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent Indicency: finds the darbeet in the picture and blurred it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it, by feeding with an average pixelength, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel it at any time with the button push.</seg>
<seg id="624">The Regentropes are a nice little tool to make brackets on your picture. this gives it natural your pictures a hot look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Dripping size allows to change the size of the drop. since the droplet size does not grow automatically with the size of the picture, it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and the density of the sperm. fish change the optical effect of drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the digitization; image editing a area free from rain drops. use the choice of tools to choose the area, for example a face that shall be free to select. if you start afterwards the filter for rain drops, the area will remain free of regentropes.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the rain drops. the original image (1) shows a calm sunset and the painted image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirror or turning into the right orientation. you can find the tools in the menu transformation or transformation.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflated is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">To reduce an image is simple. the big question is how can you inflate an image and sharpness the details? how can you invent the missing information again? how can you invent the missing information or guessed? the CImg algorithm used here is a good work. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can change it to the desired size with the tool size. choose your transforming size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool to size change a linear interpolation method in order to move the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation to enlarge an image. & digitization also developed by IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab new size and are considered below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Aspect ratio: if this setting is activated, when entering the new size the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter also affects larger structures. the higher the value is set, the more it is smoother, since it is difficult to determine the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's' turbulence effect he must be taller than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons Save as and store are used exactly for this purpose. it can be saved as a text file and then re-loaded it later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflatable is very fast with what it makes, but it can still take very long and a high CPU load for itself. you can abort the calculation with the button at any time.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo shoots by adding a little color to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the thumbnails (2) is the result of linear standard enhancement to the comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">To cut a photo is not only a frequent operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to compile a picture. image processing allows you to simply cut the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and draw the cheques. you will then see this rectangle during you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">Once you start the button down, the area of the photo will be cut off. this gives you a good overview how your photo will look after the cutting area. you can change the size of the area to cut the area by clicking on the corners of the rectangular area. create a new rectangle by simply drag it up with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the clipping, use the Toolbar button in the toolbar and the photo is tailored (Ctrl; + X). use the file File save or file Save as in the File menu to save the newly-cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the thumbarea, you can change the size of the rectangular area by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio, which you have defined in dialogue remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as a high-format or cross-format. in the high-format, the larger value of height and the width is always assigned to the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool After silicate ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. that means that it is always the same, regardless of whether you use centimetres, ink or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialogue exist two buttons to switch the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in a dialogue, you can use the Max. ratio to the access to the maximum possible, depending on the chosen relation and orientation, put it.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool After page ratios saves its settings depending on the orientation (Horizontal or Vertical module). if you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are stored as default values depending on the orientation. the modified dimensions are reflected in the EXIF data, so that the EXIF data remirror the image to the image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the co-operation helps provide help, so that you can put your pictures better together. these help include:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic parts are based on the principle of similarity. as the third party rule, harmonic triangles are a possibility to share a rectangle in a similar harmonic triangle with the diagonal triangle.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a division of on various natural growth pattern as e.g. the spiral of a Nautilus pussy or the blaming leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things on which we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden partition is the irrational number 1.618033988... and it was already used with the ancient Egyptians and pyramids. artists and architects together used the Golden division in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. from where every number is equal to the sum of its two previous numbers. the appending part is 1: 1.618 the golden middle. a composition that is followed by this rule is considered visually harmoniously.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle represents liquid relief lines if you put an image assembled. these aids are enumerated below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to third party, the Golden spiral creates a liquid form that can follow the eye through the picture. this type of composition brings the spectator's view along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical sonic river on this type.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangle of the golden spiral, also called Golden rectangles. it should give something that the eye is placed in the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects. this something can be simply because without the eye, it will fulfil its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangle also derive from the above discussed golden Spiral. its vertex points are the midpoints of the pages of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, Golden triangles are not the same triangles. diagonal to place these lines can be a static object dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use Golden triangles to break your frame and create a effect of professional photo ographs dynamic Symmetry. try your photofocus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach any other way.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizon flip and flip-mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic parts.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate an image around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it happens easily that the camera is not exactly vertical or horizontal. this creates a picture in which things turned around a corner. you can repair this with the digitization; image processing and tool free rotation. select your transcription Free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slider are indicated in degrees. with the button presets you can set the slider back to 0 degree. a preview of the turn is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the module Free Rotation provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the picture preview to position the two lines. after you fix it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now, adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you turned out a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to repair is it's the function transformations to exploit from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the function Automatically tcutting. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option anti-aliasing option does the picture a bit after rotation. however please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectivical transformations are carried out around a fixation point in the so-called reference point. this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your picture. the preview is then automatically recharged. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas that originated through the transformation are into pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas that originated through the transformation are into pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle on the top: shows the current angle in degrees at the top left of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle on the top: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle on the left below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the picture becomes a little lubricated. for individual adaptation, this effect is small, but two adjustments create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective you get unhappy triangular holes in the corners. one way to clean it is the picture with transforming crop cutting from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The utility tool is used to move a part of the picture into one direction and shift the other part into the opposite. it is no spin, the picture is distorted. in other words, a rectangle becomes transformed into a parallelogram. you can start this module through transformers.</seg>
<seg id="679">Scatter your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can push horizontally and vertically. if you press preference, the angles will appear on zero. a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown right from the thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="680">For your help you'll get a vertical and horizontal line. move the mouse at an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your screen and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the utility vehicles to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you performed the shot, the picture gets caught a bit. for a single shallower this effect is mostly negligible, but two notes are twice as much siblings and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After draining the picture has unbeautiful triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with transformative listings from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digitization; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write pictures. therefore the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were computed. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of machine formats.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF below it.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digicame; shows only files in formats known to the list. if the extension is listed in the list, the file is listed in the image processing. you can change this list of extensions & digitization. in the configuration you can find more information.</seg>
<seg id="686">Nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras may even choose to select the format used in Wikipedia. for a more detailed description of this file formats, you can find in Wikipedia. & digicode; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the use of data-compression procedures to digital pictures. thereby redundant information is reduced to save the image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there are better, smoother results as JPEG at the same compression relationship. the 2000s can also be stored losses if it is specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to find out more about the raw-screen format, you can read from Wikipedia, The Luminous River and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English. you can convert raw materials pictures in JPEG or TIFF with the raw-model-charging of & digitization. in the section configuration you will find further information on the use of modules with & digitization.</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of a picture. geographical data is stored in the EXIF keyword of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization provides tools available to images geographically in spherical coordination system, which is used by GPS and Galileo. height, longitude and latitude.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographical data, you need a GPS track as an XML file on the gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localizing correlator. this interface can lead a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the pictures you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu on. the above-looking dialogue then appears. to load a possible correlation above time and localization, you need to load a trace file with GPX file. of course, this file contains the same time in the same places as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded a automatic correlation carried out the coordinates in red. GPS Spare data are recorded in GMT-time and hence the camera needs to be changed at the time period. this can be done with the time zone. put your camera timezone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera types. if the deviation is underneath, the data is amalgamated. the maximum value for that is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data of one place for pictures you can edit the gpx file manually and add to the pictures. the time difference of 2000 seconds will correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and difference in minutes can be used if you don't have the right data. if you know that in reality a location in a great time difference between camera and GPS, you can put that boundaries and then hit the button correlate to the interpolishing press.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates are manually set with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same place. because the dialog allows the coordinates of a call to the next, you only need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and placed with the displayed map and enlarge. select the region in the area and enlarge Dispe.Predrag it again and again through until you'll be selected manually. the card can be switched between card mode, satellite channels and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities to hang out the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script using the exiftool to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI Module photo is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums created as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is UTF-8, in order to allow the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted. the tab allows all albums to select to choose according to HTML. you'll need to select these albums only. the albums are not hierarchical. with the three buttons on the right you can quickly choose a large number of albums. in the area below, the thumbnail will appear and the text that appears in the HTML side will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab image defines the general look and layout for each page. this rider is largely explicable. if you then click on a picture there is a new page open in which the picture is displayed. otherwise, the image will appear directly with your standard model, & eg; Kuickshow displays.</seg>
<seg id="825">The rider's album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your related images. choose a folder on which you want to use writing. a subfolder with the name KIPIts, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF data of your original pictures are also stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depths, you can change the standard color depth. of course, the variable size also influences the file size. all other settings are explained.</seg>
<seg id="828">The rider thumbnails will allow you to see some of the settings from the album riders for thumbnails, these are small pictures indicated in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window displays the user how far the action is. press Cancel to break the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages the window will not automatically closed. you can therefore view the programs to determine whether errors are performed during the creation. the web browser will automatically end up in order to preview the preview.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI imagery is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to look at pictures.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image concerned allows the Ihmsen to view a selection of pictures and to carry out on them basic operations such as rotation, zooming or deport. the beholder can be used with short beys and mouse-gestures. it has been developed for a quick picture display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is shown by default in full-screen mode. this can be changed into a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG losstfree module is a tool to change images without any of your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows for the actions listed below to save pictures in the JPEG format without the usual losses to quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the loss-free storage is it the file size rises, as no compressing of the color formations occurs. this is also used e.g. at the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera-client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI Module digital camera system currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-Imaging @ kverde.. attention: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation please contact the mailbox @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import-function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. then select the file select dialog with which you want to select the target image, so the picture to which you want to copy the metadata. the data will be copied by clicking the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere else, but not in any target format. JPEG is supported in writing. please check out exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodifier module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide.</seg>
<seg id="843">The module MPEG Kodiver can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length, and ImageMagick. between the single images you can insert a base picture. you can also add a audio file in MP2 or WAV of the slides.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images will be scaled automatically to the correct size for the chosen video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slide. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images taken into the MPEG Diashore. then you can start using extras MPEG Diaschau to start the module.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you have selected are then enumerated under image files in the Portfolio. there you can also change sorting the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should customize the other settings. the video format can be chosen from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you're planning to select the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, Secam or NTSC. PAL is default and probably the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds the one picture is displayed. the speed of the picture is determined by it. a low value creates very sudden, a high against it is very smooth switching.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set up next. in doubt you should let them black. the name and the path of the created file you can specify under name of the MPEG file file. keep in doing so the extension mpg.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify a audio file using the name of the audio file, then it will be integrated into the movie. after you've adapted all settings to your liking, you can start with the button Koding the production of the movie. depending on the speed of your machine, you can now have a coffee and enjoy a coffee if you're back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that coding or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages to the right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer resistant allows multiple images to print a piece of paper into standard photosizes. the combined pictures can also automatically be opened with Gimp. this is e.g: useful to improve you or print a direct expression with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import and convert your images within one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line dcraw from Dave Coffin. an original choice from Him is: expect from dcraw not that it produces the same results as the software of your camera carrier. sometimes you get out with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to be converted and launch the module. the Rw-image-verter window appears in the mode for a single picture. with the button preview, you can preview the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">Now you can reuse the values to optimise the converting process. the first option is to use whether the camera settings are used for the tinting character. the key parameters such as Gamma, brightness and red / blue losures can be jushed. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so you can use the contrapshots. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the convertible results. the file name stays equally and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image format, TIFF, keeps all the information your image and uses the loss-free LZW compressing.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you are planning to process your pictures frequently or otherwise continue to use it otherwise you should not choose the JPEG format as it only permits a limited number of operations prior to the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as storage structure, the metadata that are included in the RAW file are stored in the file JPEG file stored in the EXIF data.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings you can start running the conversion button. if you want to break this process again, you can do so.</seg>
<seg id="863">The batch processing mode allows you to convert various images at once. use this mode if you are sure, for example, by test a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, you have the possibility to automatically overwrite existing file. this is helpful if this is created in a previous trial. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to recompress all images in an album. it uses convert convert from the ImageMagick package. the following picture formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used for renaming all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting score, and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can make the picture smaller or enlarge. these include four types of picture change:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1.): normal size modification in a dimension. the width or the height of the image is automatically selected, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2.): size change in two dimensions. this option remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportionate sizes in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is altered during this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pressure preparation: preparing the image for the photo pressure. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper. the target image, including backsize, size size and background colour, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images to your favorite e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images before. further pictures can be drawn from the list of images to be sent there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you started the module, the image window will display images selected by you. you can add more images to the image selected by selecting a file-optionally. for the last selected image, a preview on the right will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the picture list and discard it to you to add the list of images to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button images remove the selected images from the list of images to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all pictures you can open with the button OK the new message window of your e-mail clients. you only need to add the addresses and the subject area here. the pictures selected by you are attached.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not make sure to send too many pictures to one time. most e-mail accounts have limitations on the size of the alerting e-mails. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails when you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used everytime until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your email clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you will need to specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download this here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the selection of comments can be added to an attached file, the comments to the images put together in a text file and the mail worms.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted among the lossfree formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG under images file format and the original files in the JPEG format are, then the original exifdata are added to the ending images.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not automatically shut down so you can view the status messages, in search of errors. however, your e-mail program is automatically started in the end. with the button closing, you can switch this window? en.</seg>
<seg id="885">After launching the module Advanced Diaschau, a window with questions like you want to display your Slideshow. you can choose between the pictures selected and all images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL biases option in the presentation will have a very elegant picture overpass through OpenGL. however, you need to have an appropriate graphics card, as otherwise the diashore will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The filename option displays that the filename of images displayed in the lower left corner during presentation will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop. you can then manually interrupt it with Esc afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly selected ensures that the images are displayed in random order. so it will not be used in order of images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Under delay between images can be set the temporal distance between the individual images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your machine and the selected tip effect. so you should check this before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are over a dozen transgressions between which you can select. randomly choose a different effect during any transition between images.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide bar you can access a toolbar at the top left screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left side of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date juscation currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-Imaging @ kverde.. attention: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background is a tool to put an image as a background image for the workpiece.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module is the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as a background for your KDE-worker surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes, you can interact with & kale album; through this browses, see picture. as you can see by comparing with the picture, are now available in each group, i.e. in people, places and in group keywords entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with comments. in addition, there are entries to look to EXIF based information, look at the folder structure on your hard drive and of course watch the current thumbnail. in the following, each one is described.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse to the entry, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">When you select another person only the images appear on which both persons are shown. by this selection method, you can restrict the number of displayed pictures of a few thousand pictures on a few thousand pictures.</seg>
<seg id="902">When you have selected all the people, places and other settings, you can preview with thumbnails to see the images of your activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can save with & kale album; however, for each person you can store your own thumbnails, which of course applies to places, keywords, and other categories that you have defined by yourself. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images in addition to the name, select the button which you want to use for the current category. please note that you can view the view for each category separately. this has the advantage that you can display e.g. icons with images of people and at the same time a list of keywords (if you have no suitable pictures for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you have to decide which picture to be displayed for each individual person. to do this, you will need to view the image menu, as shown in the picture. now you can select the image for the appropriate person. in the picture window you can adjust the enlarging factor according to your wishes and selecting what part of the picture will be displayed and adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you call the entry for entry in the main window, a dialogue will show you the dialog for the fixed image properties very similar. this dialog can be seen on the picture once more.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string into the field labeling or description, the captures and descriptions of the images are searched for. if you want, you can also enter a date, for example in 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom of the window, you can browse all pictures according to certain names as you can see in the picture. here you will find pictures, on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & salty album;. if you don't like to read manuals, but prefer to try out functions, you have the following alternatives to this handbook:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kadi album; and take a look at the quick entry, the screenshot and the performance videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & ay dance album; and in the first Dialog you start the demo, in case you start & # 82album; for the first time start, or select the menu item for the menu item in the menu item. after that, some examples will be loaded and you can try the functions of & knudge; try out.</seg>

<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kest album, see the timeline. a picture of this list can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this list shows you data about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can show you multiple different time units. each box displays a different unit. you can switch between the units, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the list just 10-minutes.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used in the following ways: you can change the displayed file thumbview of the database (if you select a date, the timeline will always display the current date of the moment displayed in preview images) if you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of the timeline by holding the mouse button down, and drag the mouse over the lineal of the timeline, so the schedules are drawn. if you select a range, you will be displayed in the preview view only images of this time period. you can abort the selection by clicking on a beam of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& Traveloalbum; introduces you two options to create HTML webpages with your images. the one is integrated into & kgramophone; integrated and the other is available as a module (see). in the following part of the user guide, the integrated version is described in & kakalbum; integrated version which you can call via the HTML file...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages are created you will need to make some settings. these are divided into the three ranges of content, layout and target. in the following, each area will be more precise.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the watch and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on nounpages album, HTML-example pages see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & B & B file should be created; export file should be seen on the review page. nutritional information about export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information will be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information is displayed on the viewer. for example, that all pictures are from a party. you can not use this setting for this option to hide specific pictures from certain deeds.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are clear, which is why they are not addressed specifically.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. thus, those who watch your website and own a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no images download, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time. so he can search your pictures with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission system. if he wants to see a picture bigger he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, you place the different folder and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Select a base folder for all of your HTML files and a new subfolder for any subsequent sentence.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the root folder in which all your images are saved. this folder will be saved and automatically set up the next time. thus, you can select either a folder or a KDE supported protocol for all future pictures, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your pictures, you can check if they really are all visible to viewers. if you want to select a URL for the base folder, after the pages have been created, the URL you specify here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created you are not yet in the final target folder you need to manually copy it manually. so that the import function, see, properly works you must specify the final target of the files. this is not the subfolder of current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are.</seg>
<seg id="930">The currently described setting options are based on all three basic folders and URLs, where there is a subfolder, whose name you specify in output folders.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are looking for a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kdays. together, you might want to write your pictures with them. however, if you've already got a lot of time for it, the images, persons appearing on the pictures, receptions, etc., then you have to do with & nbsp; this work doesn't even have to do.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & nbsp; you can export a copy of your images into a .kin file. these can import others into your database. the total properties are imported using ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kin files, internal and external. they differ in it whether the images are stored on the file, or if the file is only stored in the file, that you have all images in the file and that file can pass on so independently. however, the obvious drawback is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can file a .kin file directly from the File Format... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kin file along with a HTML file, this will be an external .kin file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kin file looks for the images in two times. first, the images are not found, so the images are displayed in the folder of the .kin file. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kin file using HTML-Export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can call via the menu File Exporting.</seg>
<seg id="937">The main options of this dialogue is whether it is for internal or external .kin files, as the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">In the manual, to copy the .kin file, you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .kin file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatically in the vicinity of the .kin file, copy and kale album; the images are automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most pictures already compressed to JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it normally does not compress the files to compress. if you want this, just select the option export file compressed.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit maximum size. if you want to send your friends pictures, you may not want to send the pictures in full size, as the .kin file is otherwise very big. here you can limit the size by example to say that each picture is up to 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">When you select a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu File Imported... selecting & kale album, the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard to import consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, after which folder the import images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you are named the category persons of the imported file (if you are a Dane) while this category is asked at your base persons. therefore, you are asked in the third dialogue window what categories of imported file are to be imported and which categories they correspond to your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can see the categories of the imported file using the categories of your current database. an example for this is shown on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse images and watch: if you look at pictures, you can often look inside from different picture groups & mdash, if you look at the example pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the images on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this handbook, you will undergo the various steps of (1) celebration of information about your pictures, via (2) through searching and viewing until (3) advanced themes and adaptations.</seg>

<seg id="950">& Traveloalbum; notice the folder in which your images are saved and used these at future starts. if you want to read a different database in & kakh. if you want to check a different folder tree with images, you can launch a different folder tree with images, you can start & kiss. with the option -c. as example: knudge -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>

<seg id="952">To the left you see six different symbols that allow you to preview the preview options and options for the viewer. for each attitude a detailed assistance is available, which can be accessed by one touch to the F1 button and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">You have described how you can specify different properties for every picture, e.g. people, locations and tags. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals, or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">Click on the dialog, which is used to process already existing groups. for each existing group you can select a lettering and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">Subcategories are already mentioned. in the dialog options you can set up complete members, i.e., for example, all members of a group at one time are set in a group instead of explaining all groups of a link.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "in the list of options available to you, the list of members can be made available. with the selection list, you can select the category you want. in the left window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">& kale album; shares his modular system with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module name means KIPI and means & kde; image Plugin interface. nutritional information can be found on the home page of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the menu modules. they can not be described in this handbook, as they are not part of & the photosets; but they are sold separately. however, most modules also have a help page that you can access via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by multiple applications together with each other, it may be that the modules were tested with & nbsp; therefore, you should always test new modules first with the demo database, before you access these onto your own pictures application &gt; kale album -demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or through the menu Help. do not say, I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules on KIPI together are very different, whereby it can be that some modules with & nbsp; don't work. this is the downside if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kesdays; and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other applications supported their pictures in albums: here is an album simply a folder. even though & nbsp; this type of order is not supported, simulates it for some modules the order after albums, so that you can use the functions with & kale album.</seg>
<seg id="962">Here, simulated & kly album; the current album, which is simply the current view, so all images, which shows you the picture preview at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Besides the current album, & kdays album, the modules also pass a list of albums. here goes & kdays album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">When & nbsp; s browser shows the content of a category, for example, all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category that you specified in the dialog dialog as a category for virtual albums. therefore, if you, for example, use the category persons, will do & kday album; so do if you choose to select people and share this with the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kús are not compatible you can remove them from the list of modules. start the dialog dialog box and select in the area modules which modules should be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example for a home screen as soon as you start & kdayalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>

<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kadi album; is the possibility to see any picture with notes. these include information about the people depicted on the picture etc. you can put each image either individually or for a larger number of pictures specific comments at the same time. if, for example, pictured on all pictures, Jesper and all pictures in Copenhagen have been included.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes may be used for seeking and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these remarks if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In see three lists of a text box by choosing persons, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kdays album; because you will use them again and again if you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea lies the moving of images within the list: if you have for example a family party, and on all 50 pictures shown the same 5-10 persons, you can, therefore, the names used up are moved to the top of the ones to find and classify the people faster.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to see an alphabetically sorted list, click on the icon for sorting after date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected any remarks individually for each image, you might want to edit all selected images and add these pictures with remarks. in this case, simply click on the button below and back buttons, which are located under the preview of the picture on the right.</seg>

<seg id="992">Please remember that this picture-protection is not very safe at all. for one are all pictures on the hard disk and on the other one can freely read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection serves only to those who are with & the photosets; not very familiar to repel the look at private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you spend all your pictures with & klate album; manage and spend hours on hours with it is natural that you want to look at some time. for this reason, & kale album; about a picture _ and video viewed. you can start from the preview, as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer is able to see you in. it will of course display the image, but additional all the information you enter into the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the Infobox on the upper part of the picture you want to see, you can easily drag it with the mouse and discard it elsewhere. you can also configure what information is displayed and whether or not to be displayed at all. all of these options are available on the viewer's right click below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the infobox are underlined. if you click on the browser, see the matching entries to that display. so if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you were selected by people from the browser and then Anne Helene chosen.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images in the beholder, you can switch between them and move back by letting the buttons pictures high and picture. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and end. these features are also available from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run it as diashore. & kaky album; then invites a new picture after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Strg button and Plus and minus. start and stopped the slide by the buttons Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the viewer of & the photojournalism; it is able to switch to full-screen mode. in this mode, the observer uses a complete space on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you use the viewer, you can enter the image in the image and remove it. with the Minus button you can drop out a rectangle into the center of the picture. shows how an zoom-rectangle is marked and shows the outcome of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button you can reset your zoom, so that the picture is not displayed zoomed. with the hot-key puts the zooms, allowing each pixel on the screen a pixel of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomoperations that work with videos that are in and slipping off with the Plus- and Data key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the right-click menu, you can rotate the image. this does not work with videos. you can make notes to the current image with the menu item remarks from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">When you look at pictures it can happen that you will find an image with a person whose names you have forgotten on the picture. at the moment you can open the preview and configuration dialog of the picture to give this name. however, you might prefer to just highlight the picture and consider more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer: to see which photos you want to start the viewer with the pictures and highlight them as good or bad while you see one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above gives you the opportunity to provide images with features as you look at them. features are the letters A to Z and you can put a feature by pressing the corresponding letter. in view one image where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">As soon as you have any characteristics placed on your images, these are available in your browser. so, if you want to edit all the images you want, print or whatever selected, so you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or whatever you just want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the front view. if you can view categories in Dre preview, then you can press features to the pictures by simply press the letter for the characteristic after the image was selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case allows you & kdays album to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture is not saved with the image but in the database. on the way you can undo your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In a picture you can see an image on the painted ground. to turn the painting style from the context menu. to turn to the image from the context menu. to end the image, simply hit the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To be able to work with & kpovmodeler; you have to control the application of the program & Povray; not completely control but the documentation on & Povray; you should absolutely read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the properties tab and display the object in the wiremodel.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple items at the same time. but not the object of a already selected object, as all subjects are already chosen with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object, and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the menu item.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are multiple possible positions, the following folding menu finishes, so that you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With erasing either from the menu bar in Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button, you can remove previously selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have altered attributes, click on to apply these changes. have provided invalid values then it will correct the input error and then click on it or disguise the changes with abortion.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to & Povray; user documentation in the ordering dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL users documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already includes the user's documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or a part of a texture, you can preview a preview in Featurgy's view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press the thumbnails and a small example of the scene is called with the chosen texture. as default, the entire texture is rounded off, even if you want a subordinated item (for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map), cross it locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the checkpoints of the camera. you can drag these checkpoints with the mouse button and thus change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">Once a transformation is chosen, the checkpoints disappear and it will display a small cross in the wire model. this cross marks the centre for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift through distorting with the mouse within the whole window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a visual level as a wire model. you can indicate this value relative to the visibility of the overall object or as an absolute value. objects will only be displayed when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the level of the toolbar of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as a default setting. the object tree and view of the property properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement, or if you need a different order, you can set it in any number. you can also store several shutters and simply switch between different orders.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or under one view, drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the anfading to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then entrenched to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to view more views on one another, drag the drawing water in the middle of a different view. you can then change between the views by clicking on the top statement in the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible shutters are sulcus views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to view a view from anchoring, pull the starter on the desktop or click the small arrow to the left arrow in the editor.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the editor. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu you can find entries for any type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them in any place.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view enables you to store with view shutters... save it. a dialog appears, where you can save the window of window under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can renown it. & kpovmodeler; use & Povray; 3.1g to rendering, this program has to be properly installed. as this manual is written & Povray; 3.5 to date. this version is in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To renderate the current scene, click on the icon renders in the toolbar or select the menu item in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode matches the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of the rendering. if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of Render modes, from a quick preview to full pictures in the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the symbol The Render settings in the toolbar or in View Mode... select, the following dialogue will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, it makes sense, but a name that lets the features of the mode can be recognized.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the body card size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you only want to select a small area of the image, select the section section below and enter the image section to the rendering field.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the Combinational field Quality you can select the characteristics that use & Povray. this is from a very simple color and lighting model to a model with complex-diffuser reflections. a detailed description of the Render properties can be found in the user manual too & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">When a picture is looted with only one beam per pixel, various errors can occur. these images often have a Moirche-pattern or steepy-effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel. this effect means aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally speaking, pictures with this feature are better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn off anti-aliasing, calculated and connects & Povray; more than a ray per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because every pixel is constantly split and adaptive because each pixel climbs up again and adaptive because the recursion depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray a beam up pixel. if the difference between color values to the specified pixels, then, both pixels are calculated by the tracking of a particular additional number of pixels with super sampling. if you set the low value on 4, a guard of 4x4 extra points will be calculated, at a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the pre-defined threshold, then the pixels is divided into 4 sub-pixels that will be followed individually and be tested on further subdivisions. the maximum depth of recursion can be set with the lowering.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generating noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you turn off jittering, changed & Povray; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The final setting for the quality of the renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; which diffuse diffuse light reflection. it takes very long to let a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can set whether the Alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the associated rays have not made an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; -account output. if & Povray; unexpectedly ends, you can find the reason for it here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene can import, select the menu entry File Imported... and select a file in dialogue window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; Not yet the full instruction of & Povray;. if at importing error messages or warnings, a dialogue window shows a list of all reports.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can draw objects from the object tree in the editor to export the source code for & Povray. this adds to the source code of the object to import objects in the editor, just highlight the source code in the editor and drag it into the tree-tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and Pasting in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray; also.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler: a scene fells. usually, this is Povray or x-Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click in the self-owner view, opens & kpovmodeler: the & Povray; user documentation for the displayed object. set the path to your documentation and version. the version 3.1g and 3.5 will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example altimeter) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file occurs in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color of the wire models. the second color is used for viewing the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color will be used for viewing points. the second color is used for viewing the checkpoints.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The colour of the rectangular area for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type labels.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the sheet-catch of the points on the grid-menu in the context menu of the wire model. you can set the buttons separately for shifts, scaling and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Greater values results in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but do not require more time to rendering it. for some objects such as the ball, you can adjust the detailed press for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross the High Detailed projections for extended projections, all the wire method are further divided, if the camera is used an advanced projection. extended projections, all projections, with exceptions of perspective and the vertically projections. this property gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">If you cross a wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is displayed in a chess-board pattern of two single-stellae colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">If you cross the floor, a ground is looted below the objects. the ground is shown in a chess-board pattern from two single-stellable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you cross edge smoothes, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering the scenes. the values for depth and swelling can be set. more precise information about the parameters can be found in section Render-modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">This page allows you to change existing window regulations or create new window rules. in the window panel, you will be explained how to create and store window rules.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Combinations Standard-shutters: displays all existing shutters. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window-order at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing shutters shows all existing shutters. you can create a new arrangement with the button Add and delete a selected arrangement with the button removal.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window of window is identified by the name. the name must be clearly and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name displays all views of the selected window order. new views can create you with the button Add and select selected views with the button Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column, create a new column on the right hand side of the existing window, with unlocks, you get the window under the existing window, coupled with the previous view and webend, the view does not lock in the main window but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you would like to follow no more exact knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, including beginners very popular: a bullet at a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should notice the following warnings carefully before you complain that as a result you only receive a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should note these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set camera, no rules can be applied to the rendering, as a result you will get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert any light sources, your entire scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">To install everything from error-free, take a look at the first start of & kpovmodeler: the following set of shutters:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation so you can get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols for a lot of time, so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their applications.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler: start with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree first. highlight the scene and then select the menu item erasing. so you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wiring model shows how the camera sees the whole scene that you create. in particular, please note that in the fourth wire pattern (right down). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the renderer.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now includes a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of view properties available in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user's guide to & Povray, you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Don't change anything on the basic settings of the camera, this is subject to later instructions, but note that the camera will change the checkpoints with which you can change the point of view of the camera. just click with the left mouse button and draw it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you apply the button or push the button-button, the wire-wire views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you could, for example, insert a Quader (insert Endless body Quaders) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is an amazing method of solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler: actually offers an easier way to use. you can use an infinite level as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the button and then press the button-button. in the object tree the new name will immediately be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wiring model also shows the level, even at the moment only as a limited point. if you renders the scene, the flat is stretched to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree exactly, you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the icon + in front of the object. in this case, you will find only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of the property properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the skyline, just so you get to know some of these parameters. select a shift and set the values as below:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog, in which you can select how the object is to be inserted. please choose a subject object. the pigment is then displayed in the object tree (name = bottom-pigment), with a click on the button preview how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment only needs a matured black material, because you need to browse settings for the pigment still. do not always keep in mind that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview. also, there are many possibilities, but you now take the easiest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't have a color on the Quader and the ball in the preview, then click on the button and then call the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you select your image now with a click on the icon, you should receive the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course this is not the color that you expect. here are further settings necessary. in the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called monochrome. choose this entry twice (you can also do this more frequently, but the box list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Select in the object tree any time and change the colors in the view of the properties tab:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should be easy to perform, since you should have understood the fundamental working method of & kpovmodeler: the ball is just as easy to create as the soil:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In view of the properties tab, you can instantly change the settings. put the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget the buttons, or the button), so the ball would float above the ground, as you have moved the floor around one unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering is a strange result: as seen before, the ball-surface looks like a frog black material. in the following step, you can find a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can assign a material now. like on the ground, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select accommodation object and change the name for example in sphere of pigment. click on the pigment of the pigment, select and insert the values as below:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can gain more exciting effects if you take the time to stop some finish features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflection are already partial visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed finishes, even if metallic: not selected at all:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you & kpovmodeler: but hopefully you've already learned so much that you can create simple but nice scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is a successful method to create a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you have a scene raytracen, the renderer's hypothetical beams from the perspective of the beholder (i.e. from the camera, which mirrates the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the Render is reflected, the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects work like for example. thus the scene pixels is processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see nothing without a camera, the camera is your eye, by which you see the scene. without a light source, you also see nothing, the picture is just black. obviously need any scene that should be enacted, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog, you can select a file that you have previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Always when you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted in this submenu and replace the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it is stored under the same name. it is a new file, you must enter a name and disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Displays the scene in the last recorded version. all changes since the last storage are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">You can only select this menu item when you still don't have stored modifications in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeatedly the last undated command. this menu item can only select if you have used editing routine.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Save the current window order and opens a dialog, where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or write an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the shortcut and the standard behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can change or add new commands to this option for & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbar. you can add and remove toolbar for & kpovmodeler or models.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A dump map is a way to present rough surfaces without having to model any bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file for both a pump-map and for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometric shapes you can use as components: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body. these models will then be revised to give them a realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object on pixel base, by applying a image file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a Comfortable image browser and browser. the application features a file browser in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the picture or in full-screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very easy. the file browser lists files you can click with clicking the & LMBT; or the Return / key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether every image should be displayed in a separate window, or if all images always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you're looking for a specific file, simply tap the first character of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the lower right corner. if a password file is highlighted, the file will be highlighted. you can exit the input field by pushing Return or & Escape.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the dialog request - & kuickshow; there are five body cards. in three of them, General and editing and slideshow, you can set the working method of & kuickshow; set in the two other, short-command for the display cabinet and short-command for the browser, the keyboard shortcut can be specified for the respective window.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, then the images are opened in full screen mode. if the image is not big enough to fill the screen, the rest of the ad surface with the background color is filled with the background color that you can set on down. default is not a full-screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Is this point activated, invites & kuickshow; already the next picture in the folder, while you still look at the current image. this reduces the delay whenever you choose the next image and is particularly suitable for slide show.</seg>
<seg id="1137">With this option stores & kuickshow; when finishing the name of the last opened order. the next start opens & kuickshow; this folder in the browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click on the colored beams in order to select a background color. this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode. if in window mode, window appears larger than the image, here the background is filled with the selected color.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can set & kuickshow; so set up that only some of the data types will be displayed, which can also be represented by the program.</seg>
<seg id="1140">This option allows for large images to be displayed on the full screen. this option is switched as default.</seg>
<seg id="1141">Lay out if the slideshow is to begin with the first image in a folder or with the selected image.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP-Interface of Amarok has many general functions which are mostly also found in other KDE programs. this section is made up of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP-functions of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlists browsers and scripts. an example call for the DCOP-function pause could be & eg. look like:</seg>
<seg id="1184">AmaroK supports the command-lines of Qt and & kde;. in addition, Amaroah has some own command-lines options.</seg>

<seg id="1187">In the folder of scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use it as the basis for your own scripts, or simply extend it to the functions required. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can be exchanged with Amarook and Amarov. the simplest way is to use the command dcop; which should be enclosed in any KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow the exiting of external programs and commands. in addition, the function exec () is usually used. this way dcop &gt; relatively easy to be called. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarook; sends messages to all ongoing scripts. for this reason, scripts should be monitored on the standard typing the script. for this reason, scripts, scripts, script should also ignore the events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weis the script to view the setup dialog. to save the storing and loading of the ordering data, any script needs to take care of. when a script starts, Amarook put the work folder in the folder, where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signaled that a new piece is allotted. the script might ask now & eg; with DCOP-functions to further information about the new piece (for example the metadata or the dimensions).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume-Change newVolume signal a change in volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Customar Clicked: submenu grants to the selected files of the playlist, when a custom menu item can be identified. to add the menu to your own entry, you can remove the DCOP-function dcop AmaroScript ™ Customize MenuItem (submenu PhoalItem). to remove an entry to remove dcop Amaroire removeCustomMenuItem (submenu of each).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarook; exterminated, or if the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed in order to do e.g. retooling, for example, to store data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar-Archive (.tar) which can be optional also with bzip2 (.bz2), which can be optional also with bzip2 (.bz2), so that the user can recognize the archive clearly as a Amaroire script.</seg>

<seg id="1344">The context browser displays various information regarding the one's current piece. its appearance can be adjusted with the help of context browser design. the context browser includes three subwindows: music, text and interprets. these three sub-windows are presented later into detail. they represent information about the ongoing piece on each of these different aspects.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you already have earlier versions of & Amarook; you might be aware that the sub-window has been cut off. the information presented there can now be distributed in other parts of & Amarah; in addition, the information in the statistics window is collected.</seg>
<seg id="1346">The subwindow music shows information about the currently running piece, as well as the interpreter and the album.</seg>

<seg id="1349">To view cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the context browser will also show cover images that were downloaded either with cover management or set in ID3v2 tags.</seg>

<seg id="1454">EMovix: this is a very small Linux distribution. it contains the necessary software to start playing from CD and automatically convert all videos to the base folder.</seg>
<seg id="1455">This is a convenient method, recently opened projects recharge. the related submenu contains a list of these projects. one click on one entry opens the project.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Saves the current project. if the project has already been saved, the previously created file will be overwritten, otherwise it will be asked for a new date.</seg>
<seg id="1457">Save the current project under a new file name. KDE's Dialogue Save Target As appears with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file.</seg>
<seg id="1458">Saves all opened projects. this is the same as if you would be able to Save for each individual project file.</seg>
<seg id="1459">Includes the current project. if a project has changed and not yet stored, asks & K3b; by what is to happen. you can then choose between saving and modifications. besides, you can also abort and keep the project open.</seg>

<seg id="1463">Opening the dialog "Burn" to the current project. this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialogue of the project. the only difference is the additional button of burning, the & K3b; to the burning of the medium. the burning dialogue can only be opened when the project already contains data.</seg>
<seg id="1464">Opens the Properties dialog for the current project. here you can make many project-related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of which are described above the What is this? help described (accessible via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry appears only on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. he anchor & K3b; files from a previous session to import the current project. this is useful when you are not used for a multi-session CD. the data of the previous session will always be included, even if this feature is not used. it is intended for you to see that on the medium already existing files and folders.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or Video DVD project. this function arranges & K3b; to remove imported files from the current project. this feature does not remove files from the medium, it blinded only the previously imported files.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Opens the CD-copying dialogue. this allows even without a project file to create a CD to another medium. alternatively, you can also only want to burn an image from a CD which you then eventually burn later on. you should also prefer cloning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Opens the DVD copying dialogue. this allows even without a project file to create a DVD to another medium. alternatively, you can also only convert an image of a DVD using copying dialogue. in addition, there is also the possibility of buying a DVD using copying dialogue is not yet supported, so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire (video) data of the source medium in the original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Opens the dialog to delete a CD-RW. this allows you to delete the whole content or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Opens the dialog to formatting a DVD. this dialog allows you to format a DVD ± R (W), whereby the content is completely deleted. & K3b; lets you choose between the writing model and incrementally.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Burns a previously encountered CD-screen. the dialog requests you after a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file is currently not supported by pressing the burning button. (neros * .nrg files are currently not supported, therefore you have to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">Burn a previously inherited DVD-screen. the dialog asks you after a * .iso file as a data source, which can then be burned down by pressing the burning button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">A previously exubered DVD video can be converted. this dialogue window typically released after reading a DVD in the table view, but can also be allfully used. it contains information about the rolment video, coding preferences and even options for changing the size and to cut black edges.</seg>

<seg id="1475">Shows a list of tooling of & K3b; if an entry is crossed, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">When this is crossed, a small box at the bottom of the window is displayed. it contains information about the status of & K3b; and its activities. if this is not crossed, the status bar has been hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">Switch off the folder view or out. the folder view contains an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives. if the table view is enabled, its content is displayed in the table view. CD / DVD drives have also a context menu with features such as media info, locking and locking of the run or extinction of the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">Divides the table view or out. the content view allows to choose and pulling files into the projview. the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs, provided a drive selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Switches the head-list in the project view, or out. the head-list is a narrower area which is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the head view has no real function, it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialogue window to change the keycode for & K3b; but after you choose one of the commands available in the upper part, you can adjust the keynote order below.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the K3b; setup assistant. this allows you to enter the proper permissions to the burning of CDs and DVDs. for this, system management rights are needed, so you need to enter the password for the system manager (root) when starting the assistant.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & K3b;. here general images can be done. almost all functions of & K3b; should work towards Anhight. this dialog is intended to personalize and adjust the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& K3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also, with a & D tube. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality could be controlled by using a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; to use functions, you can either use the command line dcop, or the somewhat more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in functionality, therefore more your taste and type of your task is crucial to what the included programs you give.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we take note that you use the command line dcop. to use the & DCOP; to use functions, you must first make sure that & K3b; start a bit like the following at the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & D's functions, all & kin; -program in common, supports & K3b; mainly two other parts that are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP-interface between & K3b; provides functions like copyCD, format DVD and further functions for generating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPf createVideo DProject () DCOPf createVideo DProject () DCOPf createVideo DProject () void of COPf createVideo Dvd () void format Dvd () void format Dvd () void or Dvd () void burnCdImage (KURL url) void burndvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXIII Project method, one gets a DCOP-reference to the newly created project: DCOPf (K3b, K3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project received by # dcop K3b K3b K3b Interface currentProject This reference is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above yellow K3bProjectinterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which is only applicable on data-projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (Qstring name) void createFolder (Qstring name, Qstring Parent) void o Url (KURL url, Qstring Parent) void removeItem (Qstring junction) void removeItem (Qstring path, Qstring newname) void setvolumeID (Qstring id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders and then adds files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT @ icop K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b Kcop createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createfoldable / foo dcop _ home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>

<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the interface provided by cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on the hard disk) and by many coders who have to be default for MP3, oggenc for OGGs and FLAC (lossfree compression). other codes can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD are stored and stored in WAV files on the machine (losstproof and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these WAV files (usually one per title) compressed to the MP3- or OGG format, or in other formats like the loss-free FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, it must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggpre (for OGG) or other coding already exist. all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distribution. however, only the coding packages are installed to be used. if for example FLAC is not used, the installation is also not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which code format should be used? the chapter Welding Kodiers gives a small introduction to exter, audio quality and compressing factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word on copying from protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia to pick out the audio data from the & CD. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device does not handle the protection, it is not possible to avoid protected audio CD; simply do not use the mechanisms of the copying tools. simply avoid buying copies of copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only once has to be done (the setup dialog can be called up to a suitable configuration), it will be explained before the daily handling of a & CD. this leads to the hard drive for the slim neck of the user interface, about which you often stumble at the beginning.</seg>

<seg id="1511">Opens the main dialog dialog of & kaudiocreator; with various mapping cards (like encoder, for setting up the Encoders). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter provides sound quality, coding and compression rates, and helps you to choose the right Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information should be lost, a loss-free audio format is needed. besides FLAC there are also other like 'shorten' or 'monkey' that may be available for this distribution. the downsides are the low compression rates and hardly any commercial devices that can reproduce these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, the information generated by data compress according to their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG can have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower Bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate, the differences are less important since both Kodiers produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is still delivered with most distributions free of charge but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high until very high pickup quality (with high Bitrates), but compared to OGG, slightly deeper quality compared with lower Bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system, and / or if one of the few existing OGG does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special Auto-stereo systems. today - at first 2009 - support these devices only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A brief list of parameters for the audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for other parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium' = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard' = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces and has already quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 Kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 Kbps CBR, compression rate approximately 5.5. needs always 256 Kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a tiel. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate is about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good Genug for music of young people, portable devices and autographs systems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without consideration to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & cd; information that is manually entered or fetched by the program automatically from the freeDB database, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can be passed / used with & kaudiocreator; and the coding programme to create the folder name and file name as well as the features of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program statements for the coding and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, add the & CD: title to the keywords (English: day), when MP3s are coded with lame, the switches must be traced by lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audiocreator; parameters that can be used (= Knopfbedesignation in assistants):</seg>
<seg id="1530">That's what the freeDB is: a free database, able to read / enter the audio CD, so that all others can download this information instead of yourself into the calculator. it is to note that here only the text is spoken: & CD; title, artist, name of pieces & etc., not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (Ande. of the Ueberator: that's the author meant) I am not lawyer. so, nobody can prevent you from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music enterprise can be inflicated wrong. all information can be done neither to the artist nor the music company. all information can be received in any case by a Bummel through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active to choose a cross-section (sending a address). for the use of freeDB can be used with another (counterfeit) address specified in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears, the email address will not be used by the server (This may only be the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; if the use of freeDB is set up, that geographically should be used on the next mirror's mirror. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org brings a current list of spowders for the online call of & cd; information during reading a & CD. alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (generally created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to store pieces from the & CD in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that will be used cdparanoia; who wants to know more accurately, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD. s. please note that the cdparanoia package should be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For saving the loaded WAV files the coding format can be chosen. by opening the file format for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a loss-free compressing for audio data) on the tab. other coders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodifier package must be installed by the particular Linux distribution before the coding can be used. this is also required for the predefined code of coding. for more information on Kodiers are located in the chapter of Kodiers.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a code, you can get more information about his switches, through the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a consolitary window (eg; console), which must be replaced by the name of the installed code.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the installation of the device drawing of the & CD; / DVD drives, which are typing and read and whether both cdparanoia as well as the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;) installed. try both programs with a command line in a terminal screen. that could give an indication of what's wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy-protected audio CD. please check the sleeve of the CD. this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with one step by step. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, everything understood, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example and you will get enough information to set up those areas that will make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time to set up everything and use our first & CD. we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with an VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 Kbps for average and ID3v1 keyword (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">It must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as precompiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example with a search engine because it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can do of course always.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is made and that you MUST own it (eg; by trying to copy something in with the parapor).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with basic setup of & audiocreator; something that probably is done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read a & CD, which has to be repeated for any CD-CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the compression coding for the compression of music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting audio quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 Kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program containing the freeDB database to download the & cd; data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely not be able to read it in any selection of a & CD, once the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device-drawing is passed to the reading programme, so that it can read the & cd; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently / dev / CDROM is a symbolic link to the actual sound name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD. / DVD drive is available, it also helps a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existent records of the equipment for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The body card general settings. here you don't have much to do. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything will be released / typed as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information will be selected, so you will be informed if information is missing from the keyword (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The flashcard CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and allow the & CD to automatically download the internet from a freeDB computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: it has to be connected to the Internet during the reading of the & CD, so that he can access the freeDB server to the freeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is simpler, becomes a & cd; entry immediately starts reading the & CD. this is changed with low risk, if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the directory names / filendars, modify them easily and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Aside from this example is to keep in mind: if you want to manually enter it manually, then you disable the selection fields and freeDB will not use. however, this excess of 620 MB is big, consider this twice if this is worthwhile to use. to freeDB in the Offline feature, the two choices must be selected at least the first one. the mode is set up on the following map.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freeDB. these are settings for data request, for retrieving the CD database; information from the freeDB server about the Internet. how does the system know which data is to be obtained from the freeDB database? read the section about freeDB. put everything as illustrated in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "CDDB-Server:" "" "please go to the page" "" "freedb.org" "" "page and look forward to a mirror server in your vicinity. however, this approach will work between the hosts. however, this attitude will work as a first attempt." ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function equivalent to the server, as though many firewalls have the protocol 8880 standard, maybe more happiness with the protocol 80, because the & HTTP; protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want a & CD to transmit data to the freeDB server. the first deposit box should turn off.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the file / tmp is on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of converse pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time are just an existing drive? parallel reading and code? the author doesn't know it so easy to try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">"" "CD. after reading the final piece, then tick this to the" "" "CD" "" "to the end of the process." ""</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you cross this one, then / must be specified the path / folder in which the WAV files are stored. if the box does not exist, the files in the private folder are created. don't forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All you enter as it is on the screenshot. the command is somewhat long, under circumstances you need to be browsed slightly to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned earlier, this is a setting for very good audio stereo systems sufficient. the resulting bitrate is on average approximately 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and storage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id 3v1-only' for the limitation of tags at version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3' Day for & kde; in case of a later change of the tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and output file (including the full path).</seg>

<seg id="1572">At the same time, number of WAV files at the same time: when a Dualcore or Quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to code more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is what we have just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as default for each reading of a & CD. if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section is described how the process of reading the & CD. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk. first, a connection to the Internet is structured as we are comfortable and the & cd; data from the freeDB database is to be picked up. the process of which is described in this section is to be repeated for any release & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet included in freeDB, the screen photos see a little different from the data forested for a & CD. therefore, you will learn the & cd; data manually insert them instead of removing them from the internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & cd; this example is a 'special' issue of the author of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet to happen, then the & CD now has to be defined, into the drive that has been defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as in the screenshot. this only when the & CD; as an audio CD, can be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen, then you look for questions and answers following the help or go back to the previous section on the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Note: if the & CD have been picked up successfully by the freeDB, all of the songs are already filled out already and the name of the artist and album are shown.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; there is a window bundling, and you can select a database item that suits your opinion best to your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have the cross-box for automatic conversion of freeDB (on page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but the data from the internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E-step 02: the CD-editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD. according to the pattern on the next screen shot, you'll see the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current', the remainder of the data in the input field 'record'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must no longer be entered in the input field 'Currenfeld', unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments inidivell per piece, the comment box of the album is used for comments that are valid for all the pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: following the successful call of data from the freeDB database, the CD editor is not empty, but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor. however, it is always a good idea to start the content of the CD editor (e.g. if all the words with uppercase letters start or not...) but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we use ID3v1-tags. this limited the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece, and only 28 characters for the commentary area. if you set ID3v2 tags, at least on what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed. this option is set on the tabs tab; take a look at the section 'base settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of generated files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. take a look at the workerer in order to find more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that is obviously linked to the style of the inese CD. in this example, this is not important since we do not forward the & cd; for more information go to the web site of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or rap for example are found under rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After the choice of 'OK' you come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data, which we have seized for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. simply enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the titles of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Note: this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freeDB database. it is already sorted into one of these categories in the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are shown above the score list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Keep in mind that there's a check-in before each line of a piece. only the titles that are marked so are read. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece, or pressing the button all pieces select at the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Was started by clicking the button select from the reading process, so this window appears for confirmation. click OK and then we'll take a look at the window with the orders and trace what happened.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab orders for switching on the order window. it is in the upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control orders. the first piece is read just onto the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message you can see if you're trying to work with a coding which you have not installed yet. pieces that have not been successfully coded using a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the tmp-file and the target folder are not what we have entered here for example. did you check if you have writing access to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is coding of piece 1 into the format MP3. thus, reading and code simultaneously. note the status message in the bottom of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has found no configuration configuration to suppress this behavior. the only thing that can be configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code. with high-performance machines, the result is unclear. the computer used with a AMD64 appears to have no problem in simultaneous terms and code (from however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is coded and a third order appears in the queue of the body. after the last piece is coded, a small window will end up with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator; you need & k. 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the coding of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1609">This section is aimed at individuals who compile from source files and are not intended for users who are using a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs if it is running, the following is for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">One program retrieves many different other programs has many variations of settings. best read the step by step for example to get to know the options and settings. it shows screen photos of different mapping cards and also includes comments for options that may not be used for example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, always read on? even if only the help menu after the first time the program was clicked, without any clue as it should go on from that somehow empty screen (especially, when there is no audio CD in the drive), or from unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is all about? who reads this, probably already started the program. it should look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no e-mail. the author can not maintain this manual. it is considered the first version for a manual to add & kaudiocreator; who also always do something useful or change it, may it do. at least only after contacting the author. and if you read this, he did not leave this section and is therefore in agreement with this proposal.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange, if you have succeeded in getting the source file from & kde; then do not need these informations, but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& Cmid, is the MIDI- and Caravokers of & kde;. besides others it has with real-time graphics and karaoke and karaoke echoing of texts also some properties, the other & UNIX; -MIDI-players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid, runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS and & kde; support also supports the & Linux; ultrasound project driver, which is needed for the CIS. Alsa is included as soon as it supports a sequence.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& Cmid; displays the song text on the screen with changing color, making it easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI-channel through highlighting the pressing keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & Drop so that you're in & kde; any MIDI file from one & conqueror; window on cap can be drawn.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files (songwriting or text events). Kmid will automatically select the process used individually.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Seat support. when you finish & kde; during the playback of a song, Kmid will start again with the same song again next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, awe, FM and CIS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select... from the menu File. it appears the usual file dialog, with which you can select the required song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & conqueror; window into the & kmid set. -window drop. this also works with several songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and studded the button play in the toolbar, select the entry-play from the menu item, or pressing the Spacbutton.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; one piece automatically starts when you draw it on the & mid-window. (on several pieces, they are added to a collection and then replayed out.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid, play a piece, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the controller.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is too fast or too slow down, you can click the arrows on the left and to the right of the tempo and thus change the playback speed. to get back to the original speed, double click the tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The Spacebar has two tasks: when a play is played, a pressure on the space is causing a pressure on the button break or selecting the menu entry in the menu item, thus interrupts the playback. pressing the space-button during no play will start, launches & kmid; reproduction.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music. some pieces use text events, others use lyrics and again others both. some pieces have no text at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can set what events are to be displayed and even better: the erignisttype is automatically used to activate a song, so you don't have to set anything manually in the menu settings, but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to specify a type of erignit type, select from the menu settings the file pointer and issus. the same function also have keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which you summarize. these are lining up in the row. in this section stands how you can use collections effectively.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, open first the collection manager. to find this in the menu Collection under the point Organise.... Click here on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will be included in the beginning the same songs as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can adjust the desired volume.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection you will reach all the songs that you want to not add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application this collection is not stored. concern you that when you add lots of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there, you can add a song with the button to add a song. it again appears the file dialog, with whose help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the attitude of automatic execution to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic packs to the collection is enabled, a piece of opening (using file opening or drag & drop) automatically added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">When Automatically is not enabled for the collection, by opening a piece of the temporary collection, the temporary collection will be activated and signalized. this collection will then be added the further opened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click on Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played out. if you select the row from the submenu flashing of the menu collections, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or choose to choose random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song, select the button next song, the entry next song from the menu item, or press the button arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the button previous piece, the entry previous piece from the menu item, or press the button arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection manager, choose the collection and click the button Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this plays no role as it is not stored when leaving & cmid; not saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers who are not general-MIDI-capable. in this case the MIDI-map general-MIDI events are translated into events that synthesizers the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI-map, which converts all events of the change Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the change Change patch to Trumpet, and thus always carries a trumpet, if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you do not need MIDI-map because all sound cards are GM -compatible (incl awe - and CIS cards, FM-devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps, so you need to edit the corresponding file from hand (using your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-map is a text file, which stores all necessary realizations for the playing of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear as often as desired. but a prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text id (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "name of the Keymap"... END Define KEYMAP "A further Keymap"... END Define CHANNELMAP... END Options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for Options) and END that the end of a paragraph is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail, so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not general-MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section the patches of General MIDI are shown on your specific keyboard. general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign will be ignored. it is assumed that GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and also have no line for any of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional UKeysTo M is needed to put all notes that this instrument requires to put on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard, for example, can take a hurricane (e.g. with clay 60), which is similar to a gun. therefore, you enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 (rifle), it takes a patch 100 (the drums on your keyboard) and sets the sound 60, irrespective of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here is a patch on the patch with the term "drum patch (drum, tank, Maracas & etc;) and not the one where the sound means the sound-height of the always same drum (as some keyboards have).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to specify how sounds are shown on a particular channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the order of the lines is very important, as well as its presence. so you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keyboard maps for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly needed to set off tones on the perk channel. look at the keymaps for example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to scrolling some channels to others. if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel, you can easily do it in CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However these settings are useful for keyboards that have percussion on a certain channel (general MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices require 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel shown on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap will naturally need to be defined in the file! if you are using the Forcepatch option, all events are ignored, which try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, then becoming more patch x used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch can be useful for example to always use the perky patch on the site-on channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for Pitch Benderogo will be multiplied, in which relationship Pitch-bender events multiplied by the value n, this will be applied with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only then transmitted. the value 4096 is used, so that the Map file is not a decimal number.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM is needed that a keyboard that is intended to play a pitch using 4096, a sound higher. unfortunately, try some keyboards to play two notes up to an octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you must try a bit 'grip.' rode '.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-map, just open the dialog MIDI settings. this can be found in the menu below settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The canalview is a window with a whole bunch of claviatures (one for each MIDI channel). on these pivials you see which sounds are just playing.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the canalview to change the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel there is a list of options where you can choose an instrument, lights the button no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The canalview has (up to now) two different views to view the played notes. the view select from the menu settings below the point canview: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed-LCD displays the speed with which a song is playing. the higher the number, the higher the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. so if you find, for example, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that has to be played on how a musicpiece has to be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc.. this can lead the same MIDI file to two different devices to very different results, just as two different musicians play the same banknotes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can compel anyone, & Cmid; to use. but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you get a similar sound quality. at a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a frills (rpm, deb) from & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without awe support was compiled. to remove the problem you need to download and install an immediate distribution (for example from kmid; 's home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection but I do not want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Do so, endorse & kmid, drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & Konqueror;, choose all the files and drag them to the & mid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Select first necessarily the setting of automatic add to the collection. otherwise, the files are added to a temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can click the arrow-button on the left of the tempo- LCD device to slow down the playback. to restore the standard tempo you can double click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; -working space a & conqueror; -window with my MIDI file and & kmid; on this desktop (if I want to play a karaoke file) or I'd like to play a file, only in the & Konqueror; window change and the desired file into the window by & kmid; pull.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you only want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection, turn off the automatic add to the collection, and the new one file is added to a temporary collection. opening files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's suppose you have the MIDI files Amid, B.mid and C.A.D. First you only want to play the first file, so make the setting of automatic packs to the collection and open A.D. your temporary collection contains exactly this a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid, and to create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, they animates me, to program & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Laga (Spain). I do not have much free time for my hobbies, but I try to take a bit of time. as Hobbies I have programming, MIDI files, making music and prove things.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you would like to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files if you want to have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; have, or even if you want to make me simply happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arraver.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really want to send me a huge pleasure to send me a postcard from your place or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file (if you want this). before you want to send me a MIDI file, but you should contact me, as I might have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I've written & kmid; fully written in my spare time and threw it by anybody for this. I want to stress that I just get more programming, because / if I get feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>

<seg id="1701">And of course, my thanks also to all those outstanding musicians in the net, which give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition, & kmid - can be found on his homepage, which is located under http: / / www.arraver.es / ~ Rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, information look and pictures look. you will also find links to pages with other karaoke songs, & etc.</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, because sound quality depends much on your sound card. it's not the same if you use a FM device or a awe card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have sound card, you must compile & kmid; compile the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had a sound card, except that you can't hear any music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; mailing lists or send a fault-informed directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& kmplayer; is a simple interface for Mplayer, phono and FFMpeg. the program is used for playback video files of the Mplayer or Phonon formats, as well as to play DVD s, VCD's or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; has not yet been finished than & kin; on this computer was installed.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the KDE website to new versions, or send the question to The & kde; user mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so called andockable windows. there is always the window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that is only displayed when information is displayed in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the favorite links below the bookmark menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries, which are played by each other, you should use the category of permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to find an extra hierarchy. if you make an entry, his group and all his subgroups are copied to the current category and playback begins with the printed entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and permanent playlist can also be changed by directing editing of the XML configuration files. of course, one can only do that when & kmplayer / / share / apps / kmplayer /, can also be changed by an editor, but also by applying the menu view. by clicking a subgroup, only the XML content of this section will appear.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to choose from the menu the same with playlist, and either chosen mode selected, or chosen another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the mode of employment is left or another group is selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & kmplayer, some features can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing of ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc and change from [General Options] No Intro = 0 'option on' 1 '. if the option is not present, it can be simply inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & kmplayer; will note the files ~ / .k/ / share / apps / kmplayer / introver.k/ / share / apps / kmplayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation at the starting hand does not need to be short, it is automatically cancelled due to opening another source. however, this would end with the end-animation, however, the user can end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the ads of a favourite photos: & lt; smilts; & / / / / / / / src = "file: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif; / smilts; in the source package of & kmplayer; are in the directory testing / some examples of SMIL that are supported by & kmplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider to configure the Mplayer in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer. here, the path of the Mplayer and the intermediate storage size of the datacroms can be set out of the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for debugging is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here is the output of mplayer intentional.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this rendition in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer; everything must be configured using manual editing of ~ / .k/ / share / config / kmplayerc, as the setting up of the backend by mimeype. here is an example of a 'flash' with the module swfdec-mozilla:</seg>
<seg id="1723">"Flash" can be played inside & kmplayer; it can even be inserted in the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">So that the & kmplayer; 'flash' in HTML pages may be able to reproduce the & kmplayer; module as service provider for the MIME-type (/ x-Shockwave-flash in the interior dialog file to KDE).</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & kmplayer; is to be started in a consoles application and search for error messages related to loading your browser's library. the stolen process is crpplayer. if there are no mistakes, the backend edition is inside & kmplayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu to check).</seg>

<seg id="1742">Latex;: a professional writing application. under Unix-like systems is likely to have resorted to the package & text live; or & tetex; (for older systems).</seg>
<seg id="1743">Most of these components can be included in the software used & Linux. for installation, the documentation of the distribution or installation CD / DVD should be used.</seg>
<seg id="1744">The & kile; -project contains some already compiled packages of & kile; for different distributions allow easy installation without further compile and included on the kile; website.</seg>
<seg id="1745">This manual is for everyone - independent of the experiences with & latex;, & kde;, & kile; or & Linux;.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Advanced users must hardly read this manual. however, the support for this project or its documentation is required, the contact about the kile; the website should be made.</seg>
<seg id="1747">If questions come to or with the compile from & kile; or if extensions are desired, this should be addressed on the mailing list of kile-devel @ lists.sourceforge.net.</seg>

<seg id="1751">Finally here only a good news alert to & latex; given, it is not the ultimate book for this. um & latex; correctly to master, good lead, e.g. H. Kopka / P. W. DALY, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999 dafÃ ¼ r.</seg>
<seg id="1752">Just like other markers, includes & latex; an introduction to be specified with the general characteristics as paper format, side numbers, and text numbers, as well as a cissuance with the text. the introduction includes at least the command\\ 'class, the number begins with the command\\' {document} and must be closed with the command\\ '{document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The fast-ascent assistant of & kile; is an extra function for the quick creation of a document in & kile; the selection of the assistant (menu) provides some possibilities for the preparation of the document. you can also add some documents related to the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document type: this will be the type of document used to be desired: articles (article), book [letter], article [writing], article (DIN) [scrreprt], book (DIN) [scramer], foils [reamer], foils [promeners], or custom.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Code: it is hereby set the strings of the system. modern systems increasingly use UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best, UTF-8x should be used (for correct processing of & latex; -documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list provides the most commonly used add-on packages for & latex;. for involving them only in the cross-box they are dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), book (DIN), Articles (DIN), letter (DIN): the Documentation in Koma-Script (in compliance with German DIN). they should always be used when creating German texts.</seg>

<seg id="1759">& kile; - as well as other source code editors - the highlighting of the used commands, settings and elements (as well as the inappropriate). by & kile; a simple problem search is not closed. you should not notice it through the modest appearance of output file. however, you will save it through the modest appearance of output file. however, it will be saving you time and sensation.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With automatic relinquishment of environments, when entering a new command (e.g.\\, {Command}) of & kile; automatically a blank page (for input the text) and the corresponding line to the left of the command (e.g.\\, {Command}). this function can be disabled in the menu; set up... LaTeX commands are deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the most interesting and subtle item):</seg>
<seg id="1762">When we view the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a single mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful in creating your own & latex; once a DVI; -file] was created & kile; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI; observer for corresponding line in the & latex; -source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contained a description of the format document and other information such as the font type of & tex; or & latex;. there are lots of tools for viewing, conversion and printing of DVI; files for different systems and items.</seg>
<seg id="1765">If you use the RÃ ¶ rtsheets the elements of the DVI; file has been shortened to an element in the DVI file. -source code is the exact opposite of it. once on a section in the & latex; -source code has been clicked, becomes the corresponding position in the DVI; observer notes.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used in working with multiple files. with a master document, work is simplified with other .tex files. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set to project goals.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Fast: the & latex; -source code is compiled and the result automatically displays (if there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File watchmaking: in this mode, the DVI; -file on large inhibited â aesâ aesâ aes- and there is no appeal by & eyepiece; after the quick-building.</seg>
<seg id="1769">In case of viewing the editing tool, the three large selection fields are conceived. the selection fields were designed for the quick receding of common elements into the document. the first selection box is for the fast breakdown of the document in parts, sections, sections,... The subfolder & latex; commands given for the subdivision:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The drop-field Further is for the addition of articles such as tags, fox or references. the available possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command a name for a section, an image or other element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Cover: is used for a reference to a specified name (selection relating to a selection).</seg>
<seg id="1773">During the quote of quote, a selection list with literary influx is shown. for & bibtex; files are corresponding editors. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kb;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-field with the name GrÃ ¶ le is used for defining the font, for the main text, the fox-notes etc., there are the following writers:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile; two choices are available: 1. the assistant to create a new document by selecting the document type and laying down settings. 2. the document may be written from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ 'class contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] lays down the font. the font is not set at the beginning, this may also happen in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code is typed, the & latex must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is the use of the metal building or of a butcher's expressive.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored prior to the compile. & kile; for storage the storage is automatically expired.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Permits the compiling of the document, should be searched in the recording after the faults. when using quick-installation, & eyepiece should be started. this is not the case, it should also be considered by logging.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (English) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font 12 are created and only a few hours. the command\ 'begin using environment},\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE and\\ HUGE</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are only in the surroundings (\\ 'begin using environment} to\\ (environment}). there is no resolution (number) for the settlement in an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities for obtaining the readability and user-friendliness of the document. there can, for example, certain type of fonts, grease, couplings, submissions, etc., are added either with the command\\\ or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ {begin}: this command is for the course of course and is closed until it is closed with a\\\ '{'} or another environment. a single word in a sentence can be presented with\\ 'per word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote begins with\\ begin {quote} and ends with\\ by {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to the writing of the source with the & latex; excerpts were presented now follows a step-by-step instructions for creating a document in & kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once the assistant got some text to be entered, a few adjustments for better readability of the document should be performed. therefore, a quote, a few places in the fat and cursive pressure and a poem to apply to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, an editor or trl E can be returned to the editor (in the internal viewer). with an external viewer, the window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI file has been created, the document may be printed or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try and Spades.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a crucial file format (engl. D e V ice i nutes). these files are produced by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi-output such as printer, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screen.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI; file is the same steps as for the creation of the document (see). when clicking on DVI, the document may be printed by a file printing (in the observer) (provided the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar provides the conversion of the DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; file was created from the latex; -source code, the conversion can begin to log in to other formats using the button bar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The preview of a direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; offers a corresponding setting for all & latex; -binary files. here only Modern is to be set up under settings kile... tools used.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To look for the forestry, the mouse-cursor must be positioned in a line of the source text and fell asleep on previews. the jump to the corresponding location in the DVI. -viewer takes place.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the appropriate & latex; document of & kile; in & eyeple; in & eyepiece; as text editor you have to set (settings Oularline... editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If by using rapid delivery of the & DVI; -viewer: if there is an error, it should be a mistake, it will display in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file declares the error source in the source code. in the editor you can always click on the error that the error occured. in order to view the error message. to view the error message, must be clicked on the error in the log file and & kile; jump to faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once the appropriate button in the toolbar is clicked, a window will appear to choose the template used for the document. the template features are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting single document, a document can be written from scratch or used for the quick creation of a new document. further information is included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Seven users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for nearly all documents. templates are able in & kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file is opened or a new file is created. & kile; a new template can create a new template using a document and a selection of file templates.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a file by a file, some string of strings may be replaced by other data (e.g. name or string coding). these variables can be set up in settings Kile... settings generals.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is used to enter the document class. typically, it will be used as a document type:\\ by Class [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the assistant and thus for the commands given by the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps have been completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your custom template instead of the standard may be consumed.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any number of latex; files are created an easy way to create a template, search for one on the web and the steps described below are required.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & Kate; as an internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor of many different types of textbooks (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for example & Kate; can be made in the menu tools directly from & kile;).</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & Kate; and his lust to experience the manual for Kate dread. users of & kile; were able to start working directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of & Kate;</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; offers a very practical and latex; -command reference, which can be called for the help of LaTeX reference. it gives an optional description of virtually all commands, which can be found in & latex; use can be used as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">A double-click with paved Ctrl button to specify the tex; word meaning. this means that in this way by clicking\\ par\ '\ by\\ par\\ par.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When writing the text with penetrated left mouse button, the text is automatically copied to the clipboard automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow buttons with penetrating Shift key, parts of the source codes can be washed out in the editing window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; has the opportunity to browse all kinds of source texts and to emphasise them. for example, the & latex; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulae are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can pick up an extra sprite. this is a separate type of bookmarks within the text. the menu item allows the jump to the next or final jump. also this springmark is highlighted, so that during the first input of a sign are automatically extracted.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Machining is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as & kile; but despite Kate; important functions were added to writing a & latex; important functions for writing a & latex; special commands given their choice. in editing, the following commands may include the text selection:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Wakes a complete paragraph (group of lines that appear on both sides an empty line). with a paragraph is not meant to have a text with a single line (as in other text editor). these advanced meanings also slept with tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of source text. the only preventative thing in & kile; is thus that the demolition are separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Is the word given under the current cursorposition. this choice also has an advanced meaning as this command also latex; -commands with a wide range (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">For example, by a part of the document it can be washed out of this first and by wiring the key unf. & Kate; offers the keypole Ctrl; K with which the whole line is removed. & kile; offers its own commands to include faster motility. among machining are the following commands included in the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & kile; is contained in the description of editing volumes.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been demonstrated that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & kile; for additional commands, include editing, easy work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jumped into the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to the foot of the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command will jumped into the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the left end of the surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is before or within the command\\ begin {environment} is at the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many indebted environments, this command can quickly get lost. this command simply slept in the surrounding area, so that the intermingled ambient structure is not cracked.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups that are determined by braces {...}. taking the TeX-group are a few important commands that correspond to those from machining environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command is jumped into the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the straight clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command will sprumped towards the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed just behind the curved clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is before or behind the curved clamp of a & tex; -group #, the other end of the group is jumped (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many disguised groups-clasps, groups brackets can be lost soon. this command fell upon the last set, so that the weathered structure of the & tex; groups will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple instructions are used as a tool for use. for the purpose of suitable implementation will be used in & kile; the sign 'used for two simple application marks. & kile; he knows this case and for two asleep listings for further & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic inserting of the double room for the plate can be set up under settings kile... LaTeX - and will be left out.</seg>
<seg id="1833">There are also number-specific settings (such as ngerman or French) and thus German or frank speakers can be used. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">In the case of Shift; input taste, & kile; a smart line-break. if the current position is located within a lists of lists (such as enumerates or itemize), not only a line-break but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a tables surrounding we slept & kile; the current line with\\\\ with an attached newline break down.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & kile; is intelligent enough to support preset & latex; - or custom environments to be supported. these can be asked under settings kile; set up... LaTeX to be added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables (amp;) and all the Et characters (amp;) to each other. & kile; try to increase this. by the drama of Shift; old; amp; searches for & kile; after the nest tulator in the current line, for the columns of the current Tabulators.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & Kate; already having a good source code completion, these two modes (mostly for & latex;) is still expanded. there are three different modes as needed, and the other two are available for automatic adjustment. all of these modes can be set up for different working conditions under settings Kile... complete.</seg>
<seg id="1839">At start a new environment using the command\\ begin {environment} & kile; automatically add the command\\\ environment} after an empty line (for the text) added.</seg>
<seg id="1840">With the last character of the RÃ ¼ ders, the last letter is removed and seems to be confused by the abandonment list. on the other hand, the list can also reduce the list by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a brief description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions can be taken up by & kile; alternatively, jumping mat may also be considered, so that a simply jump to these positions can be viewed by machin jumping mat's skyline and the aforementioned parameters can be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under settings kile; set up... kile; promises number of options can be made on these lists. there can be different types of wine lists for & tex; - und & latex; -commands and wasps of the general language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is for completion of environments. there are always a few letters with\ 'begin typed and the call of the completion mode will have been used a large list with ambient adjustment. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & kile; a special mode for completion of environments to improve.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the full-tone storage space, the command adapts to the surrounding area, or the keyboards of the environment is automatically frozen and it appears\\ begin {. after this, the environment will continue completed and by the type of input will be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once it is accomplished, the environment will automatically be closed again. once & kile; realize that it is a lists environment, is even being considered a first\\ item command.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under settings kile; set up... kile; promises; default options may be made on these lists. this mode uses the possibility of locking-in mode for & tex; - und & latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& kile; supports user-defined lists of departures, which can immediately set up via sound strings... Kile Versions. as an example of a listing list, the file example.cwl, in which for example the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, the letter L is entered and the word complementary passes over the menu operating sprayer + Alt spaces, the letter L is replaced by the string\\ LaTeX string.</seg>

<seg id="1852">The dialog's graphics are designed to form graphics as simple as possible. to view the basics of graphic formats, the sections should be considered and heeded.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as well known as PDF files, but they offer an excellent foundation for all changes and rearrangement of pages. the PDF output can be repaired, so you can restart the pages with a few & PostScript; press tools and then convert into a PDF file with ps2pdf file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To be able to watch the results of the work, the source code must be compiled. all components are grouped in the menu of creating compact, Creating converting and generating views.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For the compile of the source tool for spectator such as & eyepiece; or the additional conversion can be used to keyboards by means of old; 3, by old; 4 of the DVI; file is converted to a PS file and by means of old; 5 the PS file may be viewed.</seg>

<seg id="1930">To install a plugin or a Kitty, we begin with the menu Plugins Edit. this means that the following dialogue is opened:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows to manage all the plugins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. adding plug-ins without a storage location was used & quantaplus; this path to find the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Many people often work on a project in a kind of hierarchical relationship to each other. & quantaplus, supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 project Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. Nickname is the user's nickname and serves to clear identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member may have multiple roles in the project, such as both teamleader and subproject leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can select itself from the list of members of the team member who he is. this happens by translating the team member from the list and the Button has expressed as expressed. the currently selected member (their identity) will be fett after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nickname and attitudes of one's own identity are important with regard to messages and notes. see for more information about notes.</seg>
<seg id="1938">Besides giving an overview of their team, there is a further benefit by collecting members of the team: it can be an event created for information to the teamleader if something particular occurs. see for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something particular happens in the project. an example would be the drawing of opening and closing of the project, so that later someone can be seen or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that file a file in CVS, once they are added to the project & etc.</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the page event configuration of the Shift; F7 project project settings for dialogue can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>

<seg id="1942">Notes are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">How to give comments is easy. it can either choose the editor entry from the editor-right-menu or the @ annotation keywords used in a commentary volume followed by a feature text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Remarks can be sent to a identifiable member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (roll), taking nickname of the inserted nickname subproject manager After the tyre and subproject leaders should be given the corresponding tyre or subproject names, as described in the following examples below.</seg>

<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up by means of settings Quanta. this dialog extends over some pages that are treated in succession.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behaviour of & quantaplus; concerning tags, including car communication, can thus be changed. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / small-case of tags: large / axing of automatically bearing tags. normal Groß / Kleinwort means the tags are as inserted as they are described in the tag XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / small-case of attributes: large / towercase of automatically infied attributes. normal Groß / Kleinwort means, the attributes are described as described in the tag XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically include: if requested, is optional for tags for which the final day is optional, this immediately after the bed; added.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Do not include optional tags: as above for all other tags except for simple tags.</seg>

<seg id="1955">Automatic transmissions of accent signs: controls the automatic conversion of accentuated characters into the appropriate coding during wrapping.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: Mimeypes for detection of different types of files. using the standard standard can be restored the default pastes can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard Dia encoding: coding of newly created or in other way than with file opening files (where the coding of the file may be passed). however, this setting will be released from the same in the project lists, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD was not recognized. however, this setting will be released from the same in the project lists, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & Quantaplus; created regular backup copies, so that with a blackout or crash at the next start of the program the document can be restored from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file. also for not stored documents will be a backup regularly, according to the time provided.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed in the editing area or in one's view (or the documentation in a tab), which makes it possible to look at the documentation, the preview and the source code at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structural tree, which represents the illustration of the parser-nodes in the document, can be set in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the click of the struct-click on the structural tree, the following action makes it possible to change the dissolved action by clicking the structural tree with the mouse-slip action.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the structural-tree settings, the visibility of nodes in the tree can be automatically opened when editing and how deep during a change of the structural tree will be automatically opened, blank lines are the empty areas in the text, while empty groups are such, where there is no element in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area to create shortcuts (a type of templates) which are unfolded in editing to extensive text. abbreviations are valid for groups, each one may be valid for several & DTEP; this means it can give a valid group for PHP in which the ifusacronym means something different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here, the plug-ins can be managed. plugins are part of third-applications from third page, which can be re-used by any wedge-capable application, most known & conqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following are to be stated:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plug-in if it is not located at a standarplace like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plug-in at the start, so it can open the current file, the right folder (path of the current file) or the folder folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Component in the "Only-Lese" mode: check if the plug-in is denied the store. only-Lese KPlusParts does not typically refuse the store when this option is not chosen.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: is this activated, then test & quantaplus, whether the checked information is correct. choose the entry also, if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & Quantaplus; from version 3.3, the debugger was made completely new. the support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger was set, as well as support for the dbg debugger. instead of this, a debugger plug-in concept has been implemented, which enables various implementations about plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently, only one plugin is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquants.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable debugger plug-in in the project settings. with the button options next to the Debugger-plugin selection box, the specific settings may be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & Quantaplus; interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of monitoring variables is shown. appears normally in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all holding points are listed, with line numbers and conditions listed. normally, appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the debugger (as shown in HTML) of the debugger is usually displayed in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">This action makes the connection to the debugger, if necessary, or it shares the plug-in with a debugger. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened, which needs a debugger, so that normally does not need to be respected.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart of debugging session Started the session. closes the connection to the debugger or ends the lump to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server for a debug requirement. this is equivalent to the use of a browser to look at the current document. the issue of this requirement will be displayed in the debugger issue.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Indicates the debugger, with the execution of the script and to send information on the monitoring variables as well as the current line-to-date. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution continues. happens before a debit request was started, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Indicates the debugger, with the execution of the script to start when a script is stopped, the execution continues. happens before a debit request was given, the execution starts as soon as a request is put.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger is conducting the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or any includes.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger performs the next instruction in the script, whereby if possible in functions and includes faulty.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Indicates the debugger to move the instruction and go to the next one, as if there would be the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog, in which a variable or an expression can be entered, which is to be monitored. the oversaw value appears in the variation view.</seg>

<seg id="2026">An action can be set with settings actions... created. click New Action leads to the same dialogue:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This action has been assigned a shortcut. by clicking the button user, a keyboard shortcut can be assigned to; With Kone the current shortcut is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered a text in the detailed settings, and in the execution of the action, this text will be inserted in the document on the current Cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful shareholder structure. with the help of this action, external applications can be started (usually scripting, but on it it is not limited), which will change the document or give as input (or parts of the document); even the quick start-in dialogue or the various See in... promotions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First of all, the name of the script and interpreters can be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scripting variable in the command line: $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / scripts / apps / quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable which can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will serve with the PID of the current & quantaplus; if there is of & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text will give unique to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; from the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the listed methods, a script entry of & Quantaplus; to the standard input can be determined, what is to be sent to standard input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected range of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually useful only with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input data, the output of the completed application can be diverted. there are two types of output, written on the standard copy; error messages, indicated on the standard error. it can be specified what to happen with the text written on the default output by putting the value the drop-down output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups. it is necessary for each group to create their own toolbar. in case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add actions and configure. select Settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are rather self-explanatory. pressing the New Action Knopfes at the bottom of the window will start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Simply complete all the necessary fields and add it to the right toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, in case the day attributes have and you plan to use their use, enable you to edit a dialogue of day when available, so that you can enter the action possible when using this action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that an ugly symbol. who should notice the action in conjunction with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action represents better, we will use & kiconedit; use the & KMenu;, graphic other programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses standard 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select the size of others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day start, I have decided to create a knob as a symbol. by using green (green is usually interpreted as los, rigidly, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user signaled, that attaching this symbol a & lt; startled, tag in the current document is to be added.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it must be associated with the action. this happens via the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. in addition to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the use button and continue using other tags, so there are, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quetaplus; features to the toolbar or it should be divided into a better overview by some separators in multiple groups. set the toolbar to set about settings tool. make sure the toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I would like to select the Trento (only left above) for my toolbar. after the selection of the module, which is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow-button to the right. this adds the toolbar to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want a quick way to get access to the parapor preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how Trento support grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar, could believe that the & queror; -button is the opposite of the start knob.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested using all icons to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the correct folder. after resteXML does not exist, it will be saved in the right folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust their & descriptionrc; so that their toolbar (s) will be loaded (s) when a file is opened by the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable enlargement of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language that you like most. therefore, describing this chapter as I have a & PHP; document tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you might be in & quantaplus; repository repository, if someone has done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you need to search a existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc. language. then you need to create the docrc file. the first part we will leave you, the second we deal here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration File [Tree] Doc dir 1 = Section1.html Section 2 = # Section1.html Section 2 = # Section1.html = Securehtml Sec2.2 = Sec.html 1 = dedicated 2.html 1 = ordinary 2.html 1 = tag2.html 3 = tag2.html 3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation file. for example, you can see the documentation in PHP & PHP. documentation such as:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Content, # Testing Started = Tention.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. that shows that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there's no known border for the chess loop (except through reason) mdash, but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You notice that the contents are referenced directly to a file (and consequential at the top end of the tree review & mdash; folder will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing, but watch out &... signs. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The contents section is the range of the docrc file which is to be shown to the design of the context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script creates the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. by flagging the function name and pressures of Ctrl; H for context help the documentation would be shown directly. there are only two types of entries here: the Context list (Context list) and the file lists.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separated context elements that are to be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc simply save on $HOME / .k/ / share / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or / apps / quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as stated in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc, and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are well and worth it to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. what documentation we were using to the & Quantaplus; -repository for the use by the & quantaplus; -community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the shremovable resources (DTEP packages, tool-tools, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or anyone else. at different places there is an email to send menu-mail, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all the others will be able to download it. the contributions are checked and only available when our team need it as accurate and used for publication. to obtain a useful contribution, we recommend the resources to signing that there is a GPG / PGP key. thus, the source of the resources is ensured, both for our team and for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for their private GPG keys (the Passphrase is not stored), or in the event you have multiple key, you can choose one out. in the dialog new resource, the input fields must be filled out (URL preview can stay empty) and click OK the upload button.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can upload from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), tool-bar, and in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree will begin.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, nor prior to installation, examines & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by testing the integrity and signature. in case of problems, it may then be canceled. please notice the warning messages carefully. if the integrity is given and the resource correctly signed, a message appears with the specification of the originator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML-languages that is currently not supported by & Quantaplus; it can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be necessary in tagXML format. there is the easiest way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD shop and Convert DTD menu. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that should be used. after that, the following dialogue appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory: the newly introduced & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE definition line: the string that appear in the DOCTYPE day, like HTML Public - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 transitional / / EN http / / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Tuning the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantaplus; following the transformation of the & descriptionrc; -Editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. to understand this and draw full benefit from & quantaplus; this chapter is trying to give them exactly these concepts, without their understanding & quantaplus; little benefit. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three ranges: global, local and projectrelated. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, who is & quantaplus, available. from tooling about actions it is all that is selected as globally in the joint folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure tools, actions and patterns in the global tree, which will then be available to everyone in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and tooling. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; pattern up to tooling with special actions taken specifically for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most limited size. all elements are discarded in the folder tree of the project, making the sharing of special tools and patterns by all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & Quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some major areas: the editing window, the edits, the cries with information and the toolchain. please suggest, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the driver's rider with the right mouse button, to get a right-click menu with the current document chosen entries, such as close the current, other, or all the unpart riders, newly loading, delete or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the editing area lead to another context menu regarding the edited document contents (cut / paste / paste), processing of the tags, using the mouse on the mouse, or opening the file, when the string is referred to a file under the mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the Editors there are the tooling of the editor. currently, & Quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 transitional as standard, for which a set of machine tools is demonstrated. in the course of further training of & quantaplus, the toolbar will be adapted to the new features and associated users needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tooling is really easy. if they want to insert in a simple day, then click on the icon that represents the day. now, you can insert the data for this just tag. should you want to insert the multiple attributes (like anchor), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The buildings (QIT;) allow to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; to navigate, to open and wander. in the presentation with carapots are available for files, project, model templates, scripts, scripts and documentation prints.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool to make & quantaplus; this view displays all the files in the project and allows the administrator of files in the project using the right mouse click. promotions such as adding, removal, uploading or deleting the files from storage media can then be carried out with the right-click menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. nearly everything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole website & etc. there are all possibilities open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on how they are used. the category depends on & quantaplus; the global templates are always available, local templates are only usable for the corresponding users and templates. more to templates is available in templates.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information on the available scripts. the concept of mergers in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can call the available information on a script. on the right mouse button, additional features are available, such as the script to start or send with email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">In this view one shows the internal structure of the active document. through links-clicking of a module, the cursor in the document is set to the position of the element. through the right-click of a module, a list of commands opens with regard to navigation and refresher the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other sub-views. with it can change quickly attributes and namespaces. that on the content exclusive use system allows the change of all available attributes with just a few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation for the web technology for your development. there can be pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'document site can create, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited, edited and considered.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & Quantaplus; two caro-riders at the bottom of the window, about the beneficial information can be obtained: the news window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This driver pad provides information on each in the Quanta Flash script. thus, for example, the DTD on the current document and any changes used to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This driver pad provides all errors in the current document. & Quantaplus; -scripts that will be executed, give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; tool-contractors are comprehensively extended and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the chocolate table of the toolbar is the ability to make their own commands as symbols in & quantaplus; to define.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar via e-mail. & quantaplus, sends the toolbar as a computed Tar archive across & kmail; if you receive a toolbar in an email, they can give them in & quantaplus, as any other secure and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It's reasonable if you want to adjust the location of the & quantaplus; instead, autoconf file has a number of options to get to the configure script. / configure --help one. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems when starting from & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 am a folder. also, you should ensure that no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH before your bin folder. same applies to & Qt.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& Quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; was optimized for a rapid web development and combined a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to create the best & HTML; -Editor, the developers started at & quantaplus; what would be if & quantaplus; an independent, extensible Markup languages would be? well, this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer confined to pure & HTML, is & quantaplus, now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarize: if you can define it in & XML; then you should be & quantaplus, to be the appropriate & IDE.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim has to be held that & Quantaplus; follows in good application of free software, the idea of why someone else has developed? thanks to the & knot; -Scst is not only all possible but allows users and developers, & quantaplus, to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& Quantaplus; allows web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can increase productivity almost every task. by means of comitted actions, scripts and tool systems, automation will increase almost every task. by doing so, they can increase & quantaplus, without any need to notice any scripts of scripting tax. (more about them can be found in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quanta; plus; is a web development environment designed for HTML and related languages. it was designed for a fast web development and quickly expanded to a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quanta; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in detail documentation is compatible with help: / quanta (either this URL in & Konqueror; enter or khelpcenter help: / quanta carry out).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& quanta; is currently developed and supervised by Eric Laffinch sequel @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you opened. this list changes everytime when you open a file which is not in it, being the oldest entry.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use. should you try in the section above templates. should they try to save the selected file / Text outside of the local / project folder, only a mistake will be reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts in insertion from the clipboard there are special signs to & HTML, so that they may be correctly indicated and not misunderstood by the browser as a form assignment.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard in & URL: type, which is the correct way to inserting special characters and spaces in & URL; s. in the first instance to add & URL; s used in the anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the blockages on or out. this allows you to choose text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Goes directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; -script error messages are out!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Seek a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a type grep or sed with GUI and predefined outpress to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you see the ad of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Initial and switching of the problem comes at the lower edge of the & quantaplus; main reporter is activated once you switch to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the toolbar left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with one click.</seg>

<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other featured documents will be grouped in the menu according to the filename of other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens a existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; -projects are stored with the file revers.webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog to include files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied into the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searched for the project directory according to new files they could be there. that allows e.g. to copy graphics files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Load the files in your project on the server high. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slave).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus; the project is managed. in the chapter & Quantaplus, you will find the details of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Download a project toolbar. these are stored in Project-toolbar and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to store your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this creates only the name. actions must be stored by means of setting actions... You will be stored via toolbar or you will be asked when you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Remove a toolbar from the lens. it does not delete it from hard disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar, you are asked if you want to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to das & quantaplus; -Team, in order to make the toolbar in the next publication). the menu item opens a new email message using the toolbar as attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows to upload tool to the main server, where anyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; that you or anyone else did, and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Loading / refresh the ends of the & DTD; it makes sense when the entities of the & DTEP are to be refreshed without the whole & DTEP; if this is global and a typeer in the global KDE folder does not exist, fails to load.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags available in the current toolbar code. if the standard (HTML,) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu standard in the tags menu, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day setup dialog, if there is one. this entry is always available in the menu tags, followed by & DTD; -specific submenues.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activated or deactivates the intelligent inserting of tags. currently this does only work with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent inserting means that & quantaplus; the insertion by toolbar denied if this day is contradicted to the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plug-ins are listed under the above-mentioned menu list. click on them. click on a activated plug-in deactivated.</seg>

<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the document on the basis of selected & DTD, using the external application of the tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Instant switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, the switching sometimes need time or unnice graphics. recommended is the body card mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which matches the representation in & quantaplus, 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open subwindow. by selecting a single command, the corresponding subwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Splits the status of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main fishers at or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog is influenced by any application using the KHTML Part, including the & Konqueror; -Webbrowser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">See the behavior of the Editors Day. in the documentation of & Kate; you can find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears, in which you delete entries from the toolbox, or which can add or change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the environment of the mouse cursor, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& Quantaplus; is a high-quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with every open source project developers can always use help. if they wish to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled in top from top to bottom, e.g. after filling the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can be completed later with Shift; F7 project Project properties are set.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to give, for example foo. in the input of name it is automatically filled out.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension of webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can find the server address of the machine to which you want to access, unless you edit local data. either a name (hostname.Ex.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">Lets this field empty, the default settings of the chosen protocol may be used. depending on the placement of the remote host, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the toolbar can be stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbar. when a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows files to insert files from the local file system into the project. multiple files or whole folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great when you have static content which one wants to download and change. if serverted scripts (e.g. & PHP, Python, & etc.) you have to do differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Institching, if files, that are located somewhere in the root folder of the project, are to be included. if a project is already started again, not anhaken.</seg>
<seg id="2165">This option will display all files and folders within the main folder and you can make a precise choice of vouchers.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the root folder. you can select the desired files by anhakken or, by removing the hooks, spamming out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project assistants contains three settings that simplify your work. you can upload these settings in the menu with project features in the menu profile or modified with the shortcut Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistants and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (wildcard possible) to be ignored in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additionally option to top, also files that are listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when opening the project. in can read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">Thus, the desired debugger may be selected. currently, only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the debugger plugin can be set with the button options. in this, the debugger may be described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the subwindow profiles, upload profiles can be set (see in), as well as the display of a tree-view for the content of the server for each profile, showing an own construction view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list, see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the subwindow configuration, you can turn event action and add these actions, change or delete these actions. event actions are executed when a previously specific event occurs, such as the Sights of a file. see into the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & Quantaplus; the last project, which was opened. this behavior could not currently affect.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, select a project to open project... from the menu project or the icon project opening out of the toolbar. the dialog project will be displayed and allows selection of a project.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & Quantaplus; closed, the project file will be saved automatically. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, when & quantaplus, changed files. same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">Project construction gives free access to files in the project. there the files in the current project can be managed.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folder behave equally, but missing the file opening and opening with... in with the right mouse button-click context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here, various profiles can be selected. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removal of current profile. if only more a profile is available, the button will be cancelled to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will keep in the core memory and be forgotten at programing. this possibility is useful when most common uploading files is needed and the rather insecure password can be stored on the record -option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">That will stop transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high lavendeprofiles have been created and thus the project (or parts of the project) will be uploaded on different servers. editing or creating a profile will be shown in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server on which the files are to be copied. either a fully qualified domainname or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed Kio Slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP, file (local) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. usually this does not have to be changed unless the network administrator operates a service not on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety wave, this is either a time-saving function or a risk. use them at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk so it can not be read easily, but everyone with programming experience can easily be seen in the plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and tooling. it can give a lot of views in a project, i.e. by simple exchange views, various files and tools can be loaded and replace current files and tooling.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored or deleted in the File or Project toolbar, accessible or deleted from settings tool-toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This section describes the parts of & Quantaplus, with which one has to do most. this helps not only improve productivity, but also allows the adjustment of & quantaplus, to our own working method.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, Toolbars are in & quantaplus; best to make the tool toolbar. use and adding will be different in the section "Add of tooling."</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the symbols can be set either using the right-click menu (right click the toolbar), in which with New Action, remove a new toolbar, remove other actions like toolbar, which can be stated in dialogue where actions on this or other toolbar can be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, additional entries will be removed and action dealt with, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tool... and set settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are supplied in essential documents, code snip and files for shortcuts. we can copy, move or link each at the system existing directory in the template-tree. templates have been in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you imagine for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; included conditions for their use. please read the conditions set out at the beginning of each template used exactly.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binar is all what is not pure text. it can be any file except text, so images, & PDF; s, flash files & etc. binary templates are usually inserted in documents using shortcuts (such as pictures with IMG src = / src / url). some examples are available in the template tree under global templates. further information on the templates tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created from any text document. based on these templates, new documents can be created. normally, a simple rumors for the purpose and organising the work in appropriate ways to be efficient. some examples can be found in the pre-tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template, but the same text field has to be inserted over again into the documents. you can find everything from a comment on a finnote down to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl. some examples are in the template-tree under global templates. read in for more information on the templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates are used for whole sites as templates. they are a collection of different documents organized in a folder structure, and there is currently no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure to Belieben (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select file as a template storage as a local template.</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once that has happened, you notice that (even if it was saved as a project position) the template is not visible in the project tree. look in the preliminary tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As a template. alternatively, you can simply save the selection as a local / project folder. alternatively, the selection can be deducted simply by pulling and descendant on the commands.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a repository folder. all file management functions can be used for it, such as pulling and drafting or inserting the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">In file tree, you can click on a folder on the right and select Site template, submit a name for the template and secure it. by default, the project folder is backed up, but of course, it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very target-oriented pre-way procedure. you can make headlines and footers or dynamically with PHP; shape, add files or connect with them. in addition, you can keep some of the things while using templates in projects very profound.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template-structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files presented in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / templates and $HOME / .k/ / share / apps / quanta / templates. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of vessels as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behavior of a folder, in the pre-view view, click on the folder and select the context menu features. the following dialogue appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A drop-down with the three types earlier; files, text or templates. this selection is disbanded as soon as elterous attributes have been damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default, and fit for everything except the trunk. if a root folder it would be disabling, unless they would appear explicitly. in the case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text-Baustein. if nothing appears, one is probably in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Permitted or set text for templates in this folder. this could be general header and footers for all templates for a specific project and allows copying of contents into a folder with special headers / footers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate header-lines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a right-click menu (pointing the right mouse button) for a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and paste from templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& Quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & source text editor that are accessible via the View menu. the first mode will replace the editing window in two parts: the code Editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it invites a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor. then you can edit and switch if required to source code editor, in which the changes performed in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; -Editor on a document that incorporates & PHP; -source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. to edit & PHP; it is still necessary to modify the source code editor. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that simultaneously changing the changes both in the source code and in VPL; editor activated. with pressures of F9 this mode is already active, the key pressure from a window to another, where the position in the document is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The sync position between the VPL; editor and the source code Editor is adjustable using settings Quanta allow you to choose between synchronisation after one click or automatically. in the selection, you can automatically set the time period. basically, the recommendation is valid for fast machine and a large margin for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website so tool document properties can choose. thus, the editing of invisible tags at work with the VPL; editor is also called once a new document with the VPL; editor created. this will serve the suspension of the filthy code. this allows you to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. swords for Internet search engines. meta items can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons located below or removed. one click into the list allows modification of content, e.g. keywords in column name and keyword keywords keyword on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS-rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS-rules with the buttons on the list. a change over the list is possible as with the Meta elements. editing of CSS-rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to insert an external CSS-style, by pressing on the file-open button and select the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursors is possible like in a word processing, through loading with the arrows, possible. in rare circumstances the marker acts as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleting with or deleting or deletion.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is made in the same way via tooling, as in the source code Editor, it is to note that inserting tags previously available already existing identical tags, e.g. when a anchor-day, surrounded by text, everyone must be removed from the same anchor drops.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some tool-tools such as the tables assistant or the lists-assistant are disabled. you will later in & VPL; work in this release will need to make the tables or lists toolbox.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for checking stills. in contrast to other programs for stills, the search for certain elements is possible and the performance of the style can be tracked.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparisons. so why & nbsp;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merger was very complicated, because one of the contributors had made many changes and simultaneously had been corrected in many places the reciration had been corrected. another programmer had altered lots of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me only showed me the changed rows, but I could not see what exactly was changed inside these lines. and there were no indications of the places where perhaps the reciration had changed. that brought about this change was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">So this was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could be differences within one line and changes to white signs. later, a lot of other useful features were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you want to compare, for example, simply copy it into the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparative windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function which did a lot of work, was the comparing and merge of folders. this function changed & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way together will be fully supported. this is useful when two persons are working independently from each other on a piece of code, and make changes. the co-operation editor under the differences. in this editor you can even editing the result. in this editor you can even edit the outcome directly. the screenshot shows three Quell files together:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you also in the same and merge complete folder. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in a folder-containing:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and serve them according to the possibilities of today's colour monitors. if you frequently need to review Kode, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tablers are shown visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white signs, one can see that on a look at the summary in the column at the left side. (no trouble anymore when someone changes the file recovery.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file differently is different. red color indicates that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all the files have the same name, but in different folders, you can easily make tipparture by writing only the filenames of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 Ordner2 folder-folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The Open-Dialog allows to type file type, select a file via the file server (file...) or selecting a last updated file from the list. open dialog notice your choice and display them next time. you do not have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files will be executed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you choose a folder, the same or merge version is introduced. if for A file is selected, for B and C, however, a folder, then used & codiff3; the filenames from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merges is enabled, the input field becomes active and can be processed. however, it is not necessarily required to set a output file. you can also finish this step later on.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set-up button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before starting with the same / match.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & # diff3; allows you to drag text pieces from the clipboard into the active comparative window. the comparison then begins immediately. in Open-dialog you do not have to select any files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and cast off: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which idea is behind it? sometimes a file contains such similar functions. if you want to find out how similar to these functions are, this would be a relatively big effort. you would only have to create two corresponding files, they in & codiff3; now you can copy the relevant sections simply copy, insert and then compare.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can choose nothing of & glue; only the pitfalls of text in a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors will interpret the pulling and dragging of text into another program as exiting and inserting (instead of copying and inserting). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window there is the info-line. the info-line of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Each info-line has a different color. (when the path to a file is too long, you leave the mouse a while above the line. then a small help window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source columns are the letters A, B and C characters. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed over the settings menu).</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is recognized, one sees in the color which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files. that's the next section (merge) to see good.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Links next to the text is the summarize column. when differences were found, the column shows the corresponding color. in some programming languages, the color shows on. in some programming languages, where white characters are not as important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + + e.g., white characters are relevant only in strings and comments, for the processor and in a few, rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that separates the summarizing column of the text is interrupted by the points, where the respective source file has no lines. if the line is activated, the line will be displayed on the broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison windows) also has an info line with the journal output:, the filename and [...] if you've processed the result. usually, it includes automatic combined text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, the storing is disabled!!! (use the buttons jump to next sight / unsolved conflict in order to find remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference simultaneously is a conflict that must be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the first line of the group in all windows is marked and the first line of the group is shown. (this will also be a jump of the position in the windows that the start of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group becomes the current group. it is highlighted with the color wallpaint for current area and each on the left appears a black beams.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes the automatic pack leaves or has no other line left in the group; then it is only a space for the case that you change your mind and maybe choose another source. this text does not appear in the final stored file, nor in a marker which you might copy and insert elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; signing-in; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if you are choosing the sources, ignore options or ignore ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigating, navigating mainly with the image of the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the window, you can use the arrow buttons on the right, bottom, end, Strg-beginning and Strg end, Siw as you can also use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the course window, you can also use the other buttons on editing. with the inserting button you can switch between insertion and overwriting mode. (default is the plug-in mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries columns will synchronize the view of all windows to the start of each group (as already in the section) and the editable display window was explained.</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Picture Away) or the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Picture Away) or to the next / previous conflict (see below). therefore, between resolved and unsolved conflicts will be differentiated.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marker into the clipboard, you need to press the Copy -button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-insertion). if this option is activated, whatever you mark, automatically recopy to the clipboard and manual the manual slot. be careful with this option, as you could rewrite the content of the clipboard accidentally.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Postage will be saved according to the underlying operating system. Unix-versions use a line-up characters\, and Win32-based systems use car backwards + newline\\ r\. Kdiff3 keeps the display of the source files not, therefore you should use & codiff3; also not using binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the last used files will be automatically saved when editing, and restored when the next start. (menu installation - &gt; Kdiff3 set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog provides writings with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">When you activate this option, differences are displayed in recursive script. if the chosen scripture does not support this representation does not happen at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colour, some colors could not be available in its pure form, but would be astered. on these systems the button settings automatically displays an unjust color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If enabled, it is inserted by pressing the Tabulator button the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise, a tabulator is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you input or return, the file returns will be automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When enabled, each range is automatically copied to the clipboard. you just copy the manual into the clipboard then.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which type of line type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used selection on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files are tried & kdiff3; first, all identical lines will be found in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step, white characters are not ignored. also, white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a jack-string '\' at the end of a line, others usually save a sign-sign '\'. if enabled, files are visible with different sizes in the side-side comparison, though they are different. if this option is enabled, the car mark may be treated. however, this option must be deactivated. if this option is deactivated, this option is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is deactivated. in the first part of the analysis, figures and related characters ('0' - '9', ',' - ') ignored. in the result, the differences are still indicated, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is deactivated. changes in comments are treated like changes in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive after even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly with very big files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In Automatic ressing mode, this attitude determines how long the outcome of the selection is displayed before the next unresolved conflict is ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Solder automatic all conflicts in white characters can be less important by selecting the chosen file as a source. if you need this only from time to time, then better use the functions UNle A / B / C for all unsolved white conflicts in numbers or comments, if the options ignore numbers or ignore ignore C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter on scanning and carrying out a compilation. look for details under documentation for the directory comparison and interaction.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, then the original version is attached to the Suffix .orig. if already such a backend file with the Suffix .orig exist, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapting the language of the interface. changing this option does not affect the current running program. you must finish and restart the change, so that the change is active. (this option is set in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language there is over the Control Centre).</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following codes can be adjusted separately for each entry. if this option is activated, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">The selection fields for coding appears a short hint of what the local coding is. (this can not be modified here and has an informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreting. as the coding for each file can be individually adjusted, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can choose which coding should be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-fabrication command, you might not be able to function 16-bit Unicode. (for example, your files could be 16-bit Unicode) but the pre-editor command can only be associated with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option it is possible to specify the coding of the issuing of prefabrication instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Disable this to suppress slices of changes in white characters in the text or review column. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments, if the options are to ignore or ignore (ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when you compare three files. in normal mode all differences are displayed in a colorfull swing column. but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files. depending on the choice of A & b; C, A & B; C, C or B & b; C is indicated beside the normal nor a second oversee column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you'd like to use the space available on the screen for long lines. simply finish the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Select the same window by side or cross each other. this can also be useful for viewing long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you regard the differences and then decide to bring the files together. the current file merge in the merge menu also works if you only compare two files. a simple click starts the assemblance and use the filename of the last source file as default file. (if this function is used to restart it, then the name of the last used file will be maintained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will be handed over to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that suits your claims. you can use this function for example cut disruptive parts or to correct the file recharge.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it is specified first by this external order (see above), then the output of command is the input of this pre-processing command. you can write your own preprocessor that is exactly your requirements. each entry line needs to have an associated edition line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The thought behind this is to allow the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program requires, and most users want to program that not self. however, the good news is that, in most cases, sed or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-editor command to convert the input to upper case letters: sed 's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 /'. * is a ergulary expression based on each string.\\ 1 in the subset string refers to the found text in the first round of string.\\ U converts the found text in upper case letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems do some keywords create automatically generated strings (info: / CVS / Keyword substitution). *\\\\\ _ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\\\\ (\)\\ _ BAR _ Date\\)\\ _\\\ _ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\\ (\)\\ _ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\\\ BAR _\\\\ BAR _ Date\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you might start to understand it and perhaps like this regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually a built-in function in Kdiff3. but it is well suited for example for another pre-machine command for pop. sed it / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each characters between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hand is replaced with nothing, so quasi erased.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform multiple compositions on one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something different such as perl. perl -p -p -p / REGEXP / replacement / switches' However, for perl some details are different. where sed\\ (and\\) needs, perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor are maintained to display and keep it up. further operations only change the data that is viewed in line-up algorythm.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal pre-processor, the version number is the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The procprocessor command commands are very useful, but as with any function, the text changes or differences hidden, you can't notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folder recursively and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal from the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate this and shows the simulated changes without having to really carry out,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... results selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is similar to the converse and merge individual files very similar. you only need to open a folder on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three files are merged, then folder 1 will be used as a base. if no target folder has been specified, uses & codiff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts. to restart it, you have to select the appropriate menu entry or push the F7 key. (further details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">During reading the folder, you will find a small news window about the current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folder, only the files are listed, which were compared to that.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is complete, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and each folder has been found during the scan, is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded up. you can double-click a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object or using the arrow buttons for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions All subdirectories and all subdirectories, with which you can open all the folders and folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you click on a file, the file will start straight and it appears a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in column name reflects the file type in the first folder (a). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details window to the selected object. in such a case the plug-in action cannot be automatically elected. if this will be put together, you will be informed about the problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the above picture, the colors A / B / C are the colors red, green, yellow and black used.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical insertion, the color is also identical, even though the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical when their entire content is identical. then you have a folder the same color. for folders, the age is insignificant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea to this color scheme is based on marine diff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaflet, which is only green, then yellow becomes red and later, if it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same type of file (e.g. if a folder and B is a file): error: contradictory file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, it cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B does not have the same type of file (such as a folder and B a file is): error: contradictory file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, it cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode to sync is active if only two folder and no explicit target folder were specified and if the option directories are active. then, & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that both folders are identical. if for a entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but are not identical: merge and the result is stored into both folders. (the user sees as visible filenames for the output file only B; directly after the output is copied & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are put together and select the option new file instead of intersecting (unsafe), then examine & kdiff3; the exact date appears, but the exact date appears, then the exact date appears, but the date is identical.. While such mistakes are not removed, this can't be started the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During this, one file will be processed after another. you status column displays Finish one, if that's complied successfully, and according to other reports, when something unexpected came up. if that collapsed, you should make a final review and check if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If chosen the file method of executing the file method, Kdiff3 more columns will display. these contain the number of unsolved, soldered, not whiter and White conflicts. (the column for dissolved conflicts will only be displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can merge either the currently selected entry (file or Odner) or all entries at once. if you have selected all the plug-in actions (even in all subfolders), you can merge this together.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you haven't specified any target folder, then in the three-folder mode C is used as the target, in the two folder-folder, B is chosen as the target and is used as a target and is used as a target for sync, A and / or B serves as a target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you selected a target folder, please check if all entries should be in the target folder, even in the folder structure. there are some options caused by certain entries to be skipped. check these options to avoid unloving surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To run all entries: select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the shortcut). to only run the current entry: select action of the current item, or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If due to the conflicting types there are still invalid actions, a message appears that indicates the faulty elements. you can then select a valid promotion for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you bring all entries together, a dialogue window will appear with the options running, simulate and aborting.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulation when you want to see what would happen without the real changes done. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is needed (merge a single file), then a merge window will pop up (keep the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you finish with a file, select again directory / continue or press F7. if you haven't saved, a corresponding dialogue will appear. then leads & kdiff3; his work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; to make a mistake, appears a message and detailed status information. at the end of the list you'll see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem (F7 key), lets you choose to choose another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before you continue with the problem.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were individually combined, notes & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and leads them later together. even if this has been merged or not stored, these entries are considered to be done. only when you change the merge action, these entries will again be merged.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The settings menu of & kdiff3; (Menu Settings - &gt; Kdiff3 set up...) now has a section called Directory bond with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that fit on the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. you can separate the patterns with a semicolon;. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. (eg * .cpp; * .h). the default setting is *. folders must not correspond to this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that correspond to these patterns will not appear in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '? default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that correspond to these patterns will not appear in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '? default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that are also ignored by CVS. many self-written files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this folder can be submitted to an .cvsignore file. (take a look at info: / CVS / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystems files have a default attribute. in other filesystems you have a previous score. this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When links to files: if the option is off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is switched on, the files are compared to which the links show. this is downlighted in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">With left to folder: if the option is switched on, the links will be treated as normal folder and recursively optically. (note that & kdiff3; not on possible recurrenditions check out. a link to a folder that would contain a link on your self would result in an Endless grinding and & kdiff3;) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Introduces a complete analysis of each file and shows the statistics columns. (the number of dissolved, unsolved, non-white and white conflict) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and considerably slower when applied to files that contain no text. (enter an appropriate anti-pattern).</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare a large folder over a slow network, it's possibly faster to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speeds will cost you a certain level of safety. please be using caution. this option is reduced in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">It doesn't take any real comparison. the files are considered as identical when they are equal to each other. this may be useful when copying the changer Date. please be used with caution. this option is reduced in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activate the sync mode if two folders are compared and no target folder has been specified. in this mode, the proposals to merge will be identical. also the results from the merge files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead, instead, the copying of the newer file is proposed as action. (this is considered unclear because the other file is not also changed. you should check this in any case.) This option is off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or directory is replaced by another or deleted, then the original version gets renamed and gets the extension .original .If an old backup file has already exists. this also affects the normal merge individual files, not only that merge whole folder. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder-merge view remains visible to the merge individual files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want, you can switch the option list & text window to switch to the window menu and switch between directory & text windows between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double-clicking here. however, you can add a single file directly from the tape menu. once you save the result, the status will be done automatically and the file will not be combined again if you start the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">"" "however, this status will be lost when you re-read the directory again: list of the directory:" ""</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparent with the aid of KIO slave. Kdiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folder to open, which are based on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file to a FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a single archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. you should note a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively and. or.. included. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be mascot. (# - &gt;% 23, blank spaces &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file has the name / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a short list of restrictions:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it can not be differed if a link indicates a file or a folder. then always a file is accepted as a link object. (FTP:, SFTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility of editing permissions or modification of change. therefore, the permissions or modification of change from the original. (note the option confidential to the size) (This is possible only with local files).</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently as a difference viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop starts first always the built-in differences of spectator. to start Kdiff3, press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select in Kdiff3Part view from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally, & kdiff3; two full input files. if it is applied as a part, takes & kdiff3; the names of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then, & kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - Kdiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. besides, this is unreliable, if the original files have changed since generating the patch file.</seg>

<seg id="2433">The editor notes for any difference in the files where he starts and where he ends. however, this important information is lost when the result is simply saved as a text file and it's too much effort to design extra its own file format which might store this information.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& ky mousetool; emulates a mouse click, once the mouse-cursor had a while on the same spot. it is meant to help people suffering from repetitive streets (RSI) Syndrome and which each mouse-click pains. in addition, it may emulate the pulling with the mouse. however, this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain that arises on the clicks. unfortunately, however, by the simple fault of your computer are caused. unfortunately, you may also suffer from pain that interact with the use of your computer, you should check a doctor if this is not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To clarify it again: even if & kmousetool; pain avoid that caused by clicking with the mouse, it is against pain that are caused by means of the mouse, useless. and as with all the ergonomic means, the result may be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & moumousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements, and introduces a mouse-click away as soon as you break the movement shortly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If enabled, the smart move is activated, makes & kmousetool; move now the mouse, wait until the end of the movement, before letting the sloping of the mouse are executing. in this way, you can execute the pulling in the mouse button. thus, the intelligent moving needs a little practice, but you get used quickly to it.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This delay has to be hidden after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool; one click-click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If intelligent moving is enabled, the rotary number is moving (1 / 10 s) active. here the time is hired, the & kmousetool; after shutdown the mouse button wait for the mouse to release again if there is no loading of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; is now enabled by clicking on the right and back, followed by a break, a click with the right mouse button. a slow loading point to the left and back leads a double mouseclick. these movements are started in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kshasetool; the first time is started, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can shorten the reaction time. go to sound & Multimedia, choose sound system and here the rider General. there is a slider Sound buffer to attach you to a lower value to shorten the answer time.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is marked, a & kmousetool; start with each start of & kde; it is currently only available at & k. at GNOME or other window environments, you can select the relevant documentation to find out how to start a program there.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Put all settings back on the values that were set when opening the dialogue. have you already pushed the button, the settings will be reset to the status after the last turnback of the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Finally, use & kmousetool; first, in particular with the presets. in particular, the intelligent moving you should start off first. if you then hit the automatic mouse click, you can later push the smart moving.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce the responses of & kde; to reduce lengths.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of which places a mouse-click without effect remains: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not represent a link, does not lead to inexperienced reactions. you can therefore park the mouse in such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse ruckelt, you should purify your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is that you will not only clean the mouse-ball, but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you need to take out the mouse-ball. as this happens, from mouse to mouse is different. however, it should be fast when you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">When you removed the ball, you'd have to see the roles. these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. dirt and dirt can easily compete with a flat blade or the fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the execution of & moumousetool; if you just have a difference. if in this case you use the smart moving tool, that means that & mouldsetool; no longer can end the operation by letting the mouse stop.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is that you can perform a click of mouse. thereby the status of & moumousetool; reset, and you can continue to work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and puts the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor where you want it. so, if you want to make your mouse on a neutral area of the working surface, if you're looking for a keyboard memory. safe zones for mouse-cursor are creating & win; the gray areas for the mouse-cursor and menus and the title-lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intellect, but I don't manage to edit it with it.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent moving is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very arguably possible to copy it in the clipboard and to paste again or move any other promotion, where you want to move your mouse at the right mouse button. but there will probably be some advice to them:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Use the intelligent moving, if you just start using & kmousetool; mark it at the end of the text-area a click-click and keep the switching key pressed while you move the mouse cursor to the other end of the text and enter the button-down button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. hence, each mouse is pressing a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the intelligent moving moves the different time. later, you can use the smart moving even without the audible mouse click. but this requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; to use, the Xtest extension for & X Window has to be installed. that should be the case on most system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker, and these are properly furnished.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of & ktts; they are not required for normal work with & ts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filtres, text is edited, before being sent to the program speech Dispatcher. they are useful for improving the pronunciation to replace false words or abbreviations, to select a suitable language and speaker or to circumvent certain defects of voice synthesis and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the working method of filters, it is important to know how the program "speech dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; sets four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of Screen Reaways has the highest priority. it is presented to all other orders and keeps these orders. when the output of the Screen reader is pre-read, the returned orders will continue again.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Alerts have the next priority. this level is important news as & eg. processor is reserved to hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and regular text. these orders will continue after the issue of warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News do the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application, the news used. while you & eg; a long text on a site template, you can enter & kmouth; someone who enter the room exactly. & kde; notifications are also news. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text entries. each order that you initiate from the Carpart orders is a text contract. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text entries. text entries are intended for the issue prolonged texts which have no special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four modes of order are processed in queue, with the exception of the output of screen readers. if an application reads the output of a screen ruler, while & ktts; just such an reads, this issue will be stopped and terminates.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text messages as well as on & kins; -News.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter will edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. at present there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are executed as modules. in the future, there are still further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Palette ketteners replace parts of a text by other text. the inserting parts can be delivered either as words or regular expressions. & object; the set of chat-ticons such as: -) through text or for the formatting of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understanding possible.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; reformer use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from a format to another format. in delivery of & ktts; include some XSLT files to translate & XHTML; in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speaker-optionally you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program, which sent the text to & ktts; if you have set for example on the body card for a female voice, you can read text of KDE messages about it. Siehe can read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules according to which he is applied to a voice output. if the filter represents that its rules do not apply, it gives the text unchanged at the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, warning or a & kor; alert notification; sent, it is processed by all the activated filters on the page described below. the processing by the filter takes place in the order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the furnished standard filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter, and you will see the next installdialogues displayed below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For the installation of strings, you must type a list of words or regular expressions as a comparative pattern. these patterns are found in the text, then the text is exchanged against the associated replacement text. large and spelling is not observed in comparison.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filters. you can choose this name as you like, and you just have to distinguish yourself from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column and will replace it in accordance with the string of string. the list is processed in the sequence from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the marked word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>

<seg id="2646">The breakdown filter will only be applied to the text when all conditions with an entry in a box can apply if they agree. are all input fields blank, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When compared with words the string qukettener filter contain regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. the words must therefore be limited by dividing space (spaces).</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will find no manual for writing regular expressions. but if you have installed the & # 160; expressions & # 160; expressions, click the & # 160; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regulations & # 160; expressions can be found in the bundle.</seg>

<seg id="2677">The program "speech-Dispatcher" uses a adaptable module architecture for voice synthesizers. if you want to expand & ktts; for use of another synthesizer, you get in touch with the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The program xsltproc is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; bypass filter is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc with the command apt-get install xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile & ktts; you need a current development environment of KDE (Version 3.4 or newer) including packages colb and the developer files for the program "speech Dispatcher."</seg>

<seg id="2798">This handbook explains the installation and use of & knetworkstation;, a module for the & controlcenter; which allows the administration of the network interfaces, routine and DNA settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated interface. the & controlcenter; can be accessed through choice of K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkstation; -package was designed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way, as other settings from the & controlcenter; allow for users to create a simple surface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation a new module network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; display the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting-controlcenter; Internet & network network settings in the & KMenu; start.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf could not install network hardware. physical equipment and its drivers have already to be fully installed and configured so that & knetworkconf; the device itself shows and the adjustment of the network features allows.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed at installing & Linux; installed and set up. network devices later added, the drivers need to be loaded via adaptation of the following files, corresponding to the core version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The module network settings is loaded when the option network settings in the & controlcenter; -index is selected. when starting the module network settings, this module will automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform can not be recognized, the filthy selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and release will be best hit. by flagging the setting up to-again, the definition can be made permanently. when starting the network settings, this selection will be automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is possible only in the system management mode. before, all options are displayed gray, meaning, the settings can be considered only, the change is not possible. in the system management mode, you can access by clicking the button management mode at the bottom of the module. it is the input of the password required.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the total functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three horsemen:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The rider network interfaces is used to manage network devices of the system. all available network devices will be displayed. from the rider network interfaces, the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">You can set up the settings on the network interfaces through selection of the desired device in the list and click the button "button." in the dialog device, you can set up.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the button "button" and it shows the dialogue with further possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the selection Automatically, the TCP / IP settings are fetched by a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, TCP / IP settings are required at the same time with the start of the system services. the DHCP- or BOOTP server sends all required TCP / IP-information at every system start, therefore no further adjustment can be required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the choice of manual, without DHCP or BOOTP can be made TCP / IP configuration. in the input field IP address, the desired TCP / IP address should be specified. in the input field netmask is set to define the subnetmask.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is marked, the system initializes the network interface when loading. if the initialisation is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values specified in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would result in TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & console; you may notice whether the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the Administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched on if required. switching on an inactivated network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on interface...</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched on if required. switch off a activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on interface...</seg>
<seg id="2818">Sets up the IP address of the machine in the local subnet, which conveys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnetworks.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface needs to be selected from the network in which the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers may only be able to understand IP addresses. if the machine http / / / www.emedomain.org lists, DNS triggers these names in an IP address such as 123,45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The namespace section of the rider's namessolution allows easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed, or modified by selecting a single, up or demotion in the list with the buttons, or possessions are ranked in the priority.</seg>

<seg id="2825">The list of specifically known calculators describes billing-to-IP address for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used when using any DNS server. in small, closed networks can replace the DNS server.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually, the list contains a well-known calculator some entries that support & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses, which still will be used in the test version of IP in the future version 4.</seg>

<seg id="2830">It can be done one of the following tasks, then by clicking OK the list of static hosts is updated.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings done in the module settings are not immediately available in the system. to enable the changes, needs to be set in a & console; the following command must be reset.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf: is http: / / knetworksconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source text.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (mostly rpm packages), it ranges, if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with a graphical interface as a package or an installation tool using your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & knot is sufficient, but also the development packages with libraries and other applications will be needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This only is recommended by experienced users. however, it is not difficult, & knetworkconf; to compile them. the following commands should do so.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on fundamental network technology will be given, in the second one will discuss all of & knetworkconf; changing configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information on the integration of the PC is conveyed in a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found great circulation. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future. this description is therefore currently focusing on the popular IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is to assign the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, on & eg; workplace is the administrator, the contact point, which may be used a valid IP address, or, if available, DHCP can not be chosen redundantly!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up an own small (home) network, the IP address should be chosen from a specially for this purpose in order to avoid IP address information with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded in the Internet, therefore their use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by hiring a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses are usually used in the area of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all computers are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.00; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = the own machine). the default route is required for the IP instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The power-address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP intercourse in the local own machine. usually the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to its own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part there are the configuration files that have been affected by & knetworkconf; and where they are placed in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is dynamically modified at DSL connections, so it is not surprised if in case of active DSL connections another content is found to be established there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE, is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Suad config. another stand as expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Alternatively, you can press Ctrl; changes or additions to tasks or variables are only then active.</seg>
<seg id="2889">It appears the standard kde; -pressure dialog. if you choose out, you'll see that there are two additional & ccron; -specific options in the printing dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Prints the crontab of all users on the system. this option is only accessible to users who have extended authorisation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">Cron, for example viz-cron. & kcron; uses the command crontab to alter the schedules of the user.</seg>
<seg id="2892">An POSIX compliant & UNIX, for example with glibc. & kcron; uses standard commands from & UNIX, to experience time and date.</seg>
<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for member drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on one volume. the first goal was to provide a surface for tar, which also provided the ability of dds2tar to quickly, selective excerpts. the second goal was to answer a question that my wife did: how much longer it takes when you secure it?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it needs to be integrated by & kdat; this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; take the band back and read the prelock of the tape. realize & kdat; the preview of the band does not, you are asked if the band is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Realize & kdat; the preview, looks for the suitable index on your plate. can this not be found, you will be asked if the Bandindex will be regenerated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Everything goes smoothly, it changes the symbol for the belt drive to indicate that the band was incorporated. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the content of the tape can now be searched out by folding the item for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Prior to the termination of the bananas, first of all, the integration must be solved. there are three methods to achieve this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; provides an amendment of the symbol for the band to recognize that the involvement of the band has been solved and displays a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be ejected without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a volume of & kdat; it may be used to form it from & kdat; formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A bandage must be formatted before you can be used to store data. this process does not correspond to the formatting at & kdat;. sets out your belt drive, must be formatted before you use the belt of & kdat files. Floppy-drives usually insert a formatting of the belt, DAT drives, however, not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the bandname and the capacity goes & kdat; with the formatting of the belt. all the data on the tape are lost thereby! after the completion of the format the band is automatically integrated and is ready-up.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you bump the backup process, you need to select the files that are dealt with. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it is backed up to this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only those files are stored in the profile.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Highlight files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select from the...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup was introduced, the dialog settings for backup will open. in this dialog, you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "" "" "when you confirm the setting, the dialog appears secure. the dialogue shows the progress of the process, including the data rate and the remaining time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">Highlight a file or folder in one of the archives files in an entry for the drive. it is only checked for the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Highlight the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick. it will only be selected the marked files and / or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click on one of the archives and select the menu item in check....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the audit process has been started, the dialogue will appear for verifying. in this dialog, you can check once again your selection and change the folder-folder for verification.</seg>
<seg id="2914">When you confirm the settings for the review, the dialogue will be examined. this dialog indicates the progress of the verification process, as well as the transmission of data and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can restore the restore, the files that are to be recovered. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives files belonging to the bandwagon. it will be restored only the selected file or subfolders.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Highlight the desired files from one of the archives with a tick. it will be restored only the selected files and / or subfolders.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right click on a file or folder in one of the archives, and select from the menu to restore....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been started, the dialog provides settings for recovery. in this dialog, you can even check your selection and change the folder-folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">When you confirm the settings for recovery, the dialog appeared. this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the transmission of data and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to rebuild the bandindexfile using the belt content. this procedure destroys all existing index files for this volume. you can create the index on two types from the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This will create a backup profile with the currently selected files and default settings. you can use the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current folder-folder in which the backup should take place. according to the grouping files, the list of files is automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all the files listed under backup files, only the files are stored in the file system, such as the folder. folder, which lie on other filesystems, you can enter separately among backup files. each entry is considered apart from tar.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that is used to establish changes since the last incremental security.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before the call for tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons are added; and lt; files was not yet completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings via the CDat menu... in the Settings menu, you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the belt drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-retoolbar version of the bandtool.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Is this attitude active, transmitted & kdat; before the band is dashed the instruction to drive. in some drives this is necessary before reading or writing approaches can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; invoke a throw from the bandpass. maybe this attitude does not work with all band drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, it is dissolving the integration of & kdat; automatically discarded the belt. use this option not at Floppy-Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option switched on, try & kdat; the hardcore blockage for the belt drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you must communicate & kdat; in any case the block size for your belt drive will communicate.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a band formatted, it writes a file at the beginning of the tape. this file should only cover one memory block on the tape. the content of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band-ID. the format of this string is hostname: seconds, whereby calculator the full name of the system is formatted on which the tape is formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that has been formatted since the epoch where the tape is formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band-ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives, which manage directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work, as long as it is not about incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the content of a backup editor. this symbol is only active when a tape is integrated.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksecosystem; is a & kde; the viewer is suitable for inexperienced users who don't know where to get information about your system or where the system leaves different protocol files. in addition, & kscarlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems which occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& kscarlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. is an simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system leaves the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & kscarlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that appear on their server. & kscarlog; therefore tries to provide some extended features, which can be filtered and evaluated for certain programs using the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.4.1 & ksecosystem; a number of useful features include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included, and are explained in the next chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screen shot, & ksecosystem; functions are available, with whose help the individual protocol lines of a protocol-file easy to filter and sort. the individual ways to sorting and filtern are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start of the start, we tried to open the system's system - the system protocol. will not open it, and it opens, instead of which a small news window, so you have & kscarlog; very likely not with system management right. the protocol files are usually found in the folder / var / log, for the normal user usually no justification to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter a string into the filter bar, so that only log files will be displayed in the filter bar. in default, the drop-off section contains the entry box next to the filter. then a protocol version will only display if in one of the columns contain the string of the filter's pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2949">At this point you can also select another entry. the strings of the filter terms will then be assigned only with the entries in the column selected column, and wear it in the filter bar the name of a process, so shows you & kscarlog; all protocol lines which were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in default setting and helps you detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of the level error are displayed with a spicuous color as protocol-lines of the level note. the color-color representation of protocol-lines can be switched off dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show just certain process (e.g. in the system protocol or in cron protocol), you can select the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can, for example, be useful when you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the samba server.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can jump to new lines, jump in the context menu of the main window, in order to view all the new log-lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows the display of several protocol files in separate sub-windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu to open up additional subwindow and to manage it. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol on display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has a private website at http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.ag you will find further up-to-date information on the supply sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you will also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion Archiving: ksystemlog; in the & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following as named) as & ksysv;. this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init system develops rapidly into the standard for controlling the program starts while driving the system in the & Linux world. and therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful, and at the same time flexible is the traditional BSD -Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go on historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is below / sbin and not below / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to put a machine on System V Init without putting a re-install and re-format. therefore, you need to make sure the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that contains the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinite and the following more stewards:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d includes a lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service that you want to start when driving the system or changing to another round-level. system services include such things like network, NFS, & sendmail;, httpd & etc. system services do not involve such things as setters, which will only once start. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be on the one hand under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems do not have a lot of use for it. you can also do a rc.so in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something when driving out, which has to do with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for different places after the program init and starts the first one he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard-level-level is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see in the initial area a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look at the second column and probably realize that the default running level 3 is. if you would like to change it, then you can perform / etc / inittab from hand and change the 3. if you have done a little alternated, then you get repaired by reboot the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the correct scripts? if you enter -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder there are no real files. instead, each entry is a shortcut to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stop init actually system services? very simple: each of the scripts is written that it is an argument as start and stop. you can actually start this scripts from hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it includes a K, the script will stop with the argument stop. if it includes a S, the script will start with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish to build a simple way of setting machines for many purposes. I could win & win; a server running-level, which leaves only httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc., too, I could also have a user-level, the & win; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another character device is simple to not trivial: just drag an entry to one of the six Running Control services to one of the six Runes to start him on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. thereby, the entry is removed from its original runner-level (or its position). this will only happen if they draw an entry in the field of disposable syringing services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved when you move them to a new zone. to simply select them from the Edit menu, or select from the context menu and insert them into the target area -- even then, if the same entry has already existed in the target area of action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an item can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries, before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the trash. be therefore careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tabulator key to activate the different workspaces (Available Systemservices, Runlevel 1 Start, Runtime 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another round-level, move it with cutting into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X use) and add it to the required round-level with insertion (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an order, press the input button to switch to the Properties dialog. use the tabs button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by re-pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the danger of data loss, all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they will be restored by & ksysv; restored. changes to preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard runleveln and now the machine starts continuously. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter at LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to launch in individual user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard-level for a reasonable value (3 should usually be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I've provided some system services with & ksysv; for the execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE, or Delivery (DLD) you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details of the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way such as system services can be started in these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to the configuration for the proprietary furnishings of these distributions, but unfortunately does not conform to the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you use any other distribution: please check if all configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and also whether they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply complete without message when their configuration files are not present or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of & Linux; -Runtime varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the laplevel, so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation is based on & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Once you have made changes, you have to save it. either you use the appropriate icon of the toolbar or the entry point in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window is made up of two mapping cards, user account and the user troop. do not select the requested user or the desired group with a double-click on the entry. it appears in the dialog user and group characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some caro cards are only represented when you have enabled advanced system preferences. only if you have enabled placing bets (Quota) for users, a body card will be created where you can make individual settings. further mapping cards appear, if shadow passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd like in BSD-uniform.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The Password Password administration appears, if shadow-passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd as are installed in BSD-uniform.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This map appears only if for at least one single file system (Quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable at the quota user / quota.group on the filesystem). here, for each user, parameters can be changed for each user:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected using a base system using a location file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The kitchen-card groups informs about the group's group of selected users. the standard group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the field of primary group. furthermore, the user can be member in other groups by mark them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog characteristics of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the menu user or group or click the matching button in the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or the selected group is analogue.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO System Selector to remove and modify the boot system, remove the time up to the boot operating system, remove the standard operating system, remove, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify,</seg>
