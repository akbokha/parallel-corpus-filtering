although I had visited the US since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely great .
like many of my generation I have grown up with American movies I have danced to American music , American authors read and operated his sport .
indeed , this country had such a profound impact on me that I was mainly due to an American film journalist .
as the 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as it played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The pel@@ ican &apos;s letter , a terrible re@@ porter , who presented with the aid of Julia Rober@@ ts as Jura @-@ Stu@@ dents , who were the Supreme Court with judges who were incl@@ ined to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
free to Meth@@ od Man , &quot; I was , as if this is the absolute truth , anything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only enhanced .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I had even written a very heart@@ felt love letter about his size .
then , Donald Tru@@ mp came into operation .
much was written about xen@@ ophobia and the racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me , how it deals with his bot@@ t@@ iness .
he never stops his mind behind the mountain as he says so beautiful .
he tells exactly what he thinks like a former colleague put it , and explains publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African American , and women .
nevertheless people responded to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes , which he won in the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number ever achieved by the nom@@ inate candidate .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ est person , I asked myself ?
I couldn &apos;t get Tru@@ mp and won his elec@@ torate with the people I had learned during my time in Phoenix .
for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journal program , takes people from all over the world , a deeply sincere man , with whom I could talk about Islam and its past .
the Tru@@ mp@@ s world@@ view does not coinci@@ de with the &quot; Cincinnati Inqu@@ ir@@ er &quot; of the present editors of the &quot; Cincinnati Inqu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ atia and I had met us with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours playing &quot; Phoenix &quot; at the game .
Tru@@ mp@@ s intolerance also stands in contrast to the generosity that I experienced in Sandy B@@ ahr , who fought for life for long life , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me as her son .
it still fits in with the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me with much patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of the American life .
then there was Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and those through them em@@ bodied my love to America .
while Tru@@ mp entered its way to the nomin@@ ee Republi@@ can candidate , she offered me a stop and the counter@@ part to his restricted vision of America .
but it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps precisely because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp because they shared either racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism or because they were ready to overlook these things , broke me almost the heart .
perhaps it is unfair of the Tru@@ mp voters as a rac@@ ist .
the people in order , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and respectful and indicates a in@@ ability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows the people that their concerns and fears are not taken into account of the hectic changes in their communities .
could it be that these voters , of which most are white , voted for Tru@@ mp because they would like to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comment@@ ators have commented on a man who look down on those with cont@@ emp@@ t for those who look different from him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( D. ) . : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; waking up of white against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; words from white in reference to the white and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as it called the big Van Jones , exactly killed what America has made so magnificent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world estimate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it &apos;s nonetheless a powerful idea - which faith or background one may have always , America welcomes everyone .
for that country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
but with the election of Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , there is a huge part of the white America of this promise , and says : to hell with manifold , religious freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm .
with all this I have to think about K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who is fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
at a manifestation for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would have my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a sil@@ ently &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Muslims had a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; dis@@ armament the quantity .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; I answered them .
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they called them and their votes were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; could someone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and vo@@ ci@@ fer@@ ous &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land , for which his son fell , sent him a message .
it is now Tru@@ mp@@ s country , told the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could find no place in this new America .
and it breaks my heart to me .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children do not spoil their love of music through rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Swiss Instruments &quot; from C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
that the music , which is played in both places , not only the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fills , just 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby magnificent ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen .
for several years now La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) has been playing in the community : a young and adult belief orchestra , which has found the way to overcome them with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs abuse and banking violence .
however , this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot , who started a musical project and the youth thus offered a rare time of hope .
the young band@@ members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , says the local press No@@ tici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run by the du@@ sty streets to follow their great passion .
they always come laughing and with gl@@ it@@ tering eyes and playing in the buzz you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ colo , clarinet , o@@ bo@@ e , flute , sil@@ ke , p@@ gos , and the Con@@ ga .
music from rub@@ b@@ ish
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is practically located at the top of the biggest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay capital - on instruments produced from recovered waste material :
music with prepared instruments that consist of local firm waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where using the recycling of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez began to transform parts of the waste into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate vul@@ ge , viol@@ as , c@@ elli , contr@@ ab@@ asses , gu@@ itars , fl@@ utes , sa@@ xes , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all made out of the rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles , Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article from Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez , a local ec@@ ologist and a musician &apos;s teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , reminded the early days :
first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked at the trash . children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children .
that changed as F@@ avi@@ o something was shown what he had never seen before : one out of waste came from waste .
today , there is an entire orchestra , which plays on instruments from re@@ prepared material and called The recycled Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) draws the musical performance on :
the world produces about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
those with him and of him are the poorest people - like men in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here she turns it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational spectacle from trash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra has even played his music for the Pope Francis .
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can fight against illegal fishing
photo © F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fought wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically report international , practic@@ able solutions for environmental problems .
the re@@ publication is done within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices on the common use of content .
in West Africa , then , was known that this ship already had its illegal fishing waters illegal fishing waters , before it was looking for the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries have responded accordingly and little incl@@ ined to welcome a legislative bur@@ ner of this species on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Mos@@ ambique and the Seychelles mobil@@ ised themselves swiftly against the ship . they refused to bapti@@ ze one of their ports and refused to give him an old fishing package .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ members Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading cler@@ k of the Ken@@ yan fisheries authorities . he is part of a team that was discovered and recorded the ship at the time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
ultimately , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia , for pl@@ undering of the fish stocks of the country .
the core of this initiative , the crimin@@ ality practices crossed and protecting resources , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal fishing stop ) .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries who had at that time exp@@ elled the Premier from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries who are like @-@ minded and working together . they exchange information and stand each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , Head of P@@ ew Char@@ itable trust project En@@ ding illegal F@@ ishing . this project offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is conce@@ aled because it is extremely difficult to record , so that illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing regions .
by inten@@ tional dis@@ regard to existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing ecosystems can harm that a delicate equilibrium have .
but while actions against illegal fishing were forced by bureaucratic hur@@ ts and also by the snail speed , with the information between different countries , the actions are happening in real time , with trac@@ eable on F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
here the individual countries can communicate with each other , for example lists of existing licenses , news to susp@@ ects activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a harbour .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when moving on the open sea , via satellite .
this allows the authorities to identify ships which fish in forbidden areas . also , so susp@@ ects ad routes - such as those suggest that a ship invites its captured fish on other ships .
ideally , such studies can indicate whether the involved ships have a growing licence , where they were travelling and possibly also , whether they have a criminal sister .
countries who are against illegal fishing , can refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports . what does that ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they even can even be forced to pay for pen@@ alties , such as the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worth it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , executive director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is an advisory firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to attract estimated 20 million USD to lost revenue , who will lose the eight members of the network H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i each year due to illegal fishermen who inv@@ ade in East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishing villages , which attracts the region of commercial fishermen all over the world , including those illegal fishermen .
among their practices include actions like the sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit roy@@ als , speci@@ fying of fanta@@ sies , the fish @-@ protected species and the fish in conservation areas .
&quot; they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make up the weaknesses of a incomplete control system . &quot; says Long . &quot; earlier , a ship could be illegal fishing and a country could then say &quot; You dar@@ ed my haven &apos;t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; and this leg@@ ale slip hole is trying to close the F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far the closed front works .
since its foundation , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i was involved in more than 30 studies of demon@@ izing ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks , which had put counter@@ f@@ eit lic@@ ted licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identities and it has found glimp@@ sed ships and found .
thanks to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for the fight against crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing for large distances .
&quot; some of our studies lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
he builds a system to help the F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i , susp@@ ects the ships more precise .
photo with friendly permission from F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system that is always further developed , also helps to divide the illegal ships that are happy to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . and we try to cross , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tracking , an NGO , who also deals with fishing data and F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support .
some of the ships also turn off their automatic identification systems , so that they can no longer be ordered by satellite .
Cop@@ eland helps therefore to build a system that connects various information levels with one another . it aims to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find a criminal ships with greater precision .
one model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually exert influence on the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believe that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened a platform for Global F@@ ishing Watch , together with Google and the Marine Health Organization Oc@@ e@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed globally by means of a single @-@ trac@@ eable ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; join with neighbours to get a better picture of who he does - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts has a similar project to run in which a global system allows tracking of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only serve criminals , but also sc@@ are them off .
ships having been conf@@ is@@ cated in the past without a license and hardly expected to reck@@ on with consequences , we now know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating at F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have since bought a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had been helped to trace Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tro@@ lling networks , whose use is forbidden .
photo with friendly permission from F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , there are several hundred million dollars of illegal fishing each year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , six countries have joined together , so called the West Africa Task Force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now fighting illegal fishing , after exactly the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with certainty the goal of making even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions too , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member states appeared in Somalia its first major triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under false flag while not only was the ship without a license and were used s@@ hau@@ ling networks , which meanwhile are banned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also penetr@@ ated into the bot@@ tled waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they approach against illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proving that such a special , collaborative way of working for the protection of the oceans is actually functioning in the entire world sea .

the street movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations .
they are regarded as protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the counter@@ offensive of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

the political and economic situation of the country is deterior@@ ating continuously , which is noticeable in the daily life of Venezu@@ el@@ ans by a acute lack of food and medicine .
many representatives of the opposition saw in the impe@@ achment of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro . the chance of a fundamental change ; ultimately , however , the post@@ pon@@ ement of a re@@ election was blocked by the official authorities .

on Twitter he@@ els images that tell of arguments , as well as reports of repression and abuse .
especially big waves beat the message of polished repression in the central @-@ north of Marac@@ ay .
there , the demonstrators are returning to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves from the police and armed support in the government according to their own statement .
hours later they were able to leave the cathedral for sure , but the protests were going on .
in other parts of the country some prot@@ esters tried to stop the police forces , including those women in the An@@ den@@ state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not wear ro@@ cking because you could otherwise see something that many nation@@ alists do not have !
meanwhile , the Info@@ graphic is already taking up an Info@@ graphic circle , which forms the extent to repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has sup@@ pressed the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a counter@@ part proceedings - this was now proven in the eyes of many other innumerable people on the street . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my@@ te@@ ks Media Labs :

others consider these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government who have undertaken little against the devastating economic crisis from their viewpoint :
you took us so much - but also fear !

the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of Córdoba .
in the meantime , Mr. Qui@@ j@@ ano said now in the context of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cordoba against his father .
in the process , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined , which were committed during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting at the Bür@@ de , to carry the same name as his father , to the brutal military settlements in the prison of La Per@@ la , that he observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered .
he held the secret of family for 34 years .
in the situation at that time I believed that was all right .
I felt like a wal@@ ker .
as a child with 15 years of age , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ tur@@ ers and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was Gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie@@ ved . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was in prison in 1976 by 1978 , Deputy Commander of intelligence Department 141 in prison La Per@@ la .

no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced over the years the extent of atrocities that he had experienced as a boy , and who said before a German Tribunal for his own father .

from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had attended with a young boy who made combat sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my boyfriend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have rounded yourself with one of the ERP .
pass merely that she does not lead you one day and I have to save you .
the ac@@ ron@@ ym ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Cu@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - revolutionaries &apos;s army - the military arm of the Revolution@@ ary Workers &apos; Party of Argentina .
that is why he offered me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he said to me , I would be secret .
I was 15 years old and I thought I was fine . because , my father had brought me up .
on the military base I had to destroy the papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda stamps , books , simply everything .

my father took me four times to La Per@@ la , all in 1976 .
during the first and last time he left me in the car entrance .
when he took me the second time , he commanded me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - simply everything possible - standing .
all of this was stolen .
he gave me a little in a ceiling t@@ opped bag and commanded me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great cl@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the Bar@@ ac@@ ke , where stolen objects were put down and entertained me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I se@@ wn in and saw a couch , tor@@ tured on the human being .
it looked like a field bed and metal fe@@ ather .
later I found out that they attached to the one end of a cabinet . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was ch@@ ained there .
it rarely cat@@ ches a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured him with water and hunt him a load of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the stri@@ pe there was app@@ alling ... like a dirty Win@@ del .
years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell from his room came .
I realized the smell immediately and I realized that that of the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible for a person to do so much harm to someone else ?
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &quot;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were cap@@ tivated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and bore them .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilians who also was charged in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people were lying with the face down - everyone was cap@@ tivated by hands and feet .
near the cau@@ dal people still on the mattresses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What gu@@ ck@@ est thou so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I ordered &quot; Why did you get me ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and by soldiers killed and buried .
I know that because my father told me at home .
beside La cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms that were designated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero has put together a man and killed .
( according to information of survivors , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of trial in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , the students of Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , director of La Per@@ la memorial , runs through the former Fol@@ terer chambers .
the road that you came in here is also the way in which the kidn@@ apped came here .
if you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured it for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned as a part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were cast into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be laid .
that was the lie - the eu@@ phem@@ ism - to the surge of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &quot; War be@@ ute &apos;
my father brought all the stolen things back home .
back then in old age I had no idea what the &quot; war ute &quot; - as it called it - was .
but when I was later on military with the military , I was clear in gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war was a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps a military plate , which one is opposed to an enemy that one has fought .

but if one walks into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ table , clothing , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then that is not a war of war but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is rob@@ bery .
I have always wondered how my father , the security of security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer in gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and ste@@ al all about it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a for@@ king , and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Are you , who thou sow@@ ed cars on the road ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded anger , stroke me and cried :
if you go so far , then I will find you and get you own .
therefore we need no one else !
this is my father .
I have no single good memory of him .
when I said in the process I showed a picture of that time , on which I carried a jacket and a tur@@ hole pul@@ lover of wool . both brought my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still got clothes at home .
at that time , the defense , a co @-@ conspir@@ e would have been with this crime . I wondered , no problem , they can lay down my burden for what they wanted .
I was there anyway , to guess .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the body is the last &apos; h@@ ein@@ ous act &apos;
now , where I am older , I find re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . if you first have children , you can recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and recognizes that it is incorrect to kill .
I was going to say so far :
well , you have ex@@ ul@@ ted people throughout the dictatorship . but why the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why children do it up ?
one day my father brought a girl with his mother , whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked me the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could just have put them into prison .
I reck@@ on it was just decided to kill these people , but why their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
were these people not also families whom man was able to pass on their mortal remn@@ ants ?
the disappearance of the body is the last des@@ pic@@ able act that one can do to a human being .
my father told me , when democracy was introduced , they took machines to eliminate the mortal remn@@ ants of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were healed and lost somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but anything goes without saying .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the thought to view my Father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I had an accus@@ ation for all the atrocities that I had ever had to experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not know . I have killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ wardly tru@@ sty and asked me , why the whole exaggerated patrio@@ tism and the &quot; Western &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they claimed to have actually been good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I shou@@ ted :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed crimes committed and you forced me to participate as a child .
he only disgu@@ sted me , &quot; Na then put me on . &quot;
that &apos;s what I did .
2010 , I donated the first ad .
I had finally realised that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can dict@@ ate to me that I have pre @-@ taken . I finally said to my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest still before the end of the trial .
he was indicted for 4@@ 16 crimes : among them severe , un@@ lawful imprisonment sentence in 154 cases , murder in 154 cases , torture and subsequent deaths in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of one under 10 years of age .

the jud@@ g@@ ments in the &apos; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the range of bullying in the range of judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera ended in March 1975 and December 1978 , committed crimes against 7@@ 16 victims eventually in August .
43 op@@ pres@@ sors were found guilty for crimes against humanity . the court ordered in 28 cases of lifel@@ ong imprisonment and in nine cases there were gap between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there was Fre@@ is@@ audi@@ che .
eleven of the original 54 accused died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ judgement : murder , torture and rape by ministers . # Es@@ war@@ ism
all the def@@ endants were during the dictatorship of the military , including former military personnel , former police members and civilian workers .
Piero De Monti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the welding chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by im@@ human heads .
the judgment sur@@ part is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations working for years on fairness for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the 1995 founded Argent@@ ine organization H.@@ I.@@ W.@@ O.@@ S. , which represents the children of people who were murdered during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but research lasted 39 years .
in March 2007 the Argent@@ in@@ ean government held the country on which La Per@@ la was to be built , so that a memorial has now been managed by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation defect is the elderly in Kyoto too &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fri@@ ghtful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation errors in a centre in Kyoto , in which one can prolong his driving licence .
the photo was spread in social media .
execution of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers were a newly opened centre in which one can extend his driving licence , last month witness a very particularly un@@ successful translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a shield the Japanese word has been reported &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but perhaps also with bad@@ ges &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; when &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fri@@ ghtful motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the false translation was available from 1st to 20th September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
editing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often shared in the social media .
the mistake was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a inhabitants of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also who made the local tim@@ ations to it .
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n in Kyoto wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was removed first . the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ eller motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the proper , although tr@@ acked not quite correct term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kyoto Police in Kyoto pre@@ occupied for translation errors . furthermore , it stated that the bug was already included in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for their correctness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows on the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sincerely sorry that elderly people felt offen@@ ded by the insufficient correction ( the translation ) made of our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online News@@ service J @-@ Cast News was a little more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; fri@@ ghtful &quot; older motor@@ ists in Japan , and wrote :
the word &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; was denoun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older motor@@ ists . according to the police there is the proportion of older drivers who have been engaged in accidents across the country , but certainly cause for concern .
in the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture , for instance , were caused in 2005 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 4@@ 60 accidents . this corresponds to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , Sen@@ iors 1.@@ 8@@ 03 of a total of 11.@@ 850 oun@@ ces .
therefore , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents decreased in total , the proportion of elderly caused by the elderly in the same period has increased .
the name not mentioned re@@ porter was published in the released version of article comments on the light that prejudi@@ ce some Japanese would apparently lead to older motor@@ ists :
the article on Yahoo , using the translation errors , was among others the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; So fault is the translation really not , or ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that this is a real translation defect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in Asia
translation errors are widely used in Japan and Asia .
the site En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true del@@ ve for this bizarre bugs in English .
photo by Flickr @-@ users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
for over@@ head you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the starting text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language .
the latter calls for active master@@ y of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general , the conviction that translators are in the target language - should not be in the initial language - native speakers .
thus a French speaker , for example , should translate by English into French - not from French into English .
photo by Flickr @-@ Vis@@ itors Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as their mother tongue , who may make translations into English . this may fail due to the understanding of the excess , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of English native speakers , the Japanese language .
some companies , who do not have a foreign co @-@ worker , do not leave translation internally . then the Japanese employee , whose English is considered to be the best , no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo by Flickr @-@ Vis@@ itors Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
the verb@@ ose and pu@@ zz@@ ling sentences caused by mechanical translations show that this technology can still not substitute for a long time . this applies to some languages quite special .
some of the most strange English formulation in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints , often used by T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood .

translation errors may be as acceptable or acceptable as jewellery , or at least be harmless . but by large companies or the government , which have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the City of Kyoto continues to use a serious source for their translations in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ ors take action on the Internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free Trade ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institut für Presse and Gesellschaft ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , signed Venezu@@ elan Internet users , that they could not have access to online channels of Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users signed that the internet presence of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV was no longer accessible .
also other on @-@ station channels ad@@ jour@@ ned by the protests in Caracas , who were organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups , who oppose the Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro@@ s government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the protests started in early April after the Supreme Court dis@@ band@@ ed the Parliament and had transferred the Parliament &apos;s responsibilities to the executive and the Supreme Court themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the link is s@@ app@@ alled and recommended the users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet .
# cens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that websites of Venezu@@ elan provider is again locked .
this is from the site of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been hesit@@ ant about protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission threatened by tele@@ communication with fin@@ es and lock@@ ings when they continue to report on demonstrations , as the Commission considered this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels I registered in @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
to be amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two lit@@ re le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by a block@@ age of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) but also two other online channels . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly carries its meetings .
former research @-@ research of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that the local internet provider will sometimes use DNS . this is a technique to prompt the DNS server requests of certain domains .
when a website is blocked by DNS , the server respon@@ ds or denied the request when calling on such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third blocked channel , the transfer was stopped on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ er@@ aman &apos;s Flores , who carried the protests in Caracas , captured in custody .
Flores has been disp@@ at@@ ched while he was in a police @-@ fi@@ ery .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on broadcast again .
although some channels are still accessible over YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : the Venezu@@ el@@ ans gain access to multi@@ medi@@ al reporting on current events in the country ever further complicated .
in Paraguay up many girls to go to slaves , to obtain an education
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a son of Cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today &apos;s Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collects testimonies of other criminals that are just as they have been victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report by Elec@@ tions , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the article is part of a series titled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ es Ca@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lying cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , edited and re @-@ released by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not living together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house once more and heard , as the owner &apos;s owner was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have become of something &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a has never been treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began working as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ ta , in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls , who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is very simple : a big family with little money over@@ comes their under@@ age son or her minor daughter to another , abundant family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned is that the children must do countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a treaty which one cannot lift up .
these as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practices in Paraguay is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after completing their studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for some years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls especially affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathered witnesses , researched and denoun@@ ced .
she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of Gr@@ ati@@ tude , which is vacc@@ inated against the Cri@@ adi@@ ta , guaranteed to be silent in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family , who have their daughter in faith that they can complete their education , improve their position in society and make &quot; something out of itself &quot; that other family gives .
on the other hand , the family , which takes up the girl in himself and justi@@ fies its exploitation by believing that they would give someone a chance that would otherwise not get any training , and perhaps even star@@ ving .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
if the girl is mist@@ re@@ ated , his family will experience later many years later .
sometimes they never experience them .
in January 2016 , the so far unknown phenomenon was held in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen households but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín arrived in hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú in the hospital , her body showed foot@@ steps of heavy strikes . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military , Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as an official in the residence .
Mar@@ ín lived in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometres to the east of the capital of As@@ un@@ cion .
at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ re@@ ira struck up with a stick on Mar@@ ín until it suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela were deeply ing@@ ra@@ ined in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen society of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go company for the death of the girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they signi@@ fied the Cri@@ o@@ az@@ go as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; several dozen people came together to protest and demanded that there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no more Carolina &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay are more cows than children registered , &quot; def@@ endant Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers , it is much simpler , un@@ punished the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for an extraordinary investigation into the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was her cri@@ adi@@ ta sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes before judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be indic@@ ative - if the case for the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as labor force , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , where her father was working to log in , and her father lost his work .
your brothers had to now all work and began to sell on the street or in the market of sweets to earn money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina has been sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
in doing so , they had to split the time so that you were still time to learn .
every morning she stood up against five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer .
Friday for example , clean@@ se the fridge , pl@@ ast@@ ed the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the ground .
when the school was at the end , she went home and had time to learn .
the sooner they were done with learning , the more free time she had .
but even this time was limited because she had to do dinner for her employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says , she never had to hungry , but did not get un@@ bound@@ ed food . &quot; I was allowed to pick more books from the library of the landlord as a meal from the fridge , &quot; she reminds himself .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ is@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a Liber@@ al Party , which was in power from 1954 until 1989 , to the opposition .
at some evenings of the Hou@@ er@@ r Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a to stand next to it and read editorial from Op@@ position@@ ations such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade her to give no faith to the reports of the official media on the dict@@ ator regime .
he held it for intelligent , but did not stand with her . &quot; the house@@ holder had someone who heard , while he talked about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; they did not allow me to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would like to learn &quot; bad habits . &quot; so they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the Indi@@ genous group of the Guaran@@ i , would return home its mother tongue Guaran@@ i .
their Lord feared that they had enabled the education they had made to lose , explains them .
but she was completely clear that she was getting paid for everything she got from them , with her hard work .
also in school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a discrimin@@ ates discrimin@@ ated . &quot; one thing about which nearly never been spoken , are har@@ ass@@ ment and the ra@@ ils which cri@@ es cri@@ es are exposed to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents , a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to me at home . I did not have friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in time , where friend@@ ships develop , I especially noticeable that I was not part of a group .
the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the Society Le@@ ates the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman released the following text in a Facebook group in which one can share advertisements for cleaning personnel and n@@ anny in Paraguay .
the administration of the group is PE@@ PA Cos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a town dre@@ amt in the district of As@@ unci@@ ón .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion to my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learning .
please log in .
start from Monday , if possible .
the ad received five &quot; light @-@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a miserable girl and gave her phone number .

in the course of our history we managed to make systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice in the early history of Paraguay , where the Spanish Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores ) had to be subjected to their &quot; wives , &quot; and the local conqu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores who had still un@@ willing to support , that many girls and boys go into a system of slavery in which they are slight victims of abuse and exploitation .

&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian Parliament elections have recently agreed a draft law to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regulations regarding use and utility of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he is accepted by the Parliament , women and users must register social media in Egypt at a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a job would then be arranged , which is commissioned to grant permission to give and use social media to citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within six months with adoption of the Law , beneficiaries and users on the site of the site have to register with their right names and human resources numbers to make use of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if there is failed to do this , this could be a penalty of up to six months in jail or a pur@@ se .
the bill , which consists of six par@@ ag@@ ra@@ fen and cur@@ ated in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; je@@ d@@ we@@ de , &quot; which runs through the internet and used to communicate with others through voice , vide@@ o- and text . &quot;
it is not clear how the law is enforced , as the draft does not have an indication of how Egyptian authorities can impose the user up the user . unclear is also how they are to decide those who do not register with the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Parliament &apos;s member of Parliament and sponsors of the legislation , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered user names and users received a username and a password by the fire@@ wall , using Facebook . &quot;
this could mean Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on national level around Facebook . because of those , it would be necessary for the Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not known so far that such plans exist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical regarding the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in English &quot; Performance Research @-@ Technical Experts &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I have doubts about the technical capacity and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that in the same way as they viol@@ ently run physical public and private rooms that could also be done online .
if I take them seriously then it means they will establish a strong surveillance system to filter citizens that apply a permit or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to run them to a judicial process .
this is not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the legislative and constitutional committees , before it enters the plenary session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military thought @-@ type in parliament , in which the control should be maxim@@ ised and safegu@@ ar@@ ded , that no devi@@ ation Nar@@ ration is present on the image space , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ y@@ haw@@ k proposed a legislative preparation against cy@@ ber crime in which a lifel@@ ong imprisonment for those fores@@ een to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest . &quot;

high up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the northeast of Iraq , the Tiersch@@ utz@@ lig@@ ist H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost of the Persian leop@@ ards .
a sub @-@ sub@@ species of the larger family of leop@@ ards , which went through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ ag@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . overall , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they find less and less prey .
why is this specific type of leop@@ ards so important ?
how R@@ aza is shown in the video , &quot; is the Persian leop@@ ard the only remaining car@@ ni@@ v@@ ore in the Kurdish ecosystem , &quot; and the health and the prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on that there is a great predat@@ ory .
the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ard in fact in the free hunting ground is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video makes sure that they all have a large cat in the camera all , cr@@ aza breaks in pure joy .
being educated Bi@@ olog@@ in shows R@@ aza passionate about a different side of their country , which is not only made up of war and conflict .

in early March , 2017 , documented in Japan &apos;s daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the adv@@ ancements that were achieved during the last six years to re@@ construct the lives of those who were affected by the &quot; thre@@ e@@ fold catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , ts@@ un@@ ami and an atomic accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered the disaster .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper is located in Sen@@ da@@ i , which is in the Pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the Pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was the pre@@ f@@ ect of the pre@@ fec@@ tures in Japan Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring region of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were nation@@ alized since the ts@@ un@@ ami had entire coastal cities disappear from the map .
still , the pre@@ acher Fu@@ kus@@ hima lived a nuclear accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , already on this alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the Special Report of K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows the progress made up of six years after the advancement of local residents .
the detailed report of the paper comprises statistics of the Japanese reconstruction authorities as well as survey results of the persons concerned themselves .
the housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ( over the last , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ g@@ ob@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ fec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
the biggest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures could find Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has finished 75 percent of these houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima forms the final light at Fu@@ kus@@ hima with 70 percent .
however , one still endeav@@ ours to settle for six years after the disaster , evacu@@ ated by expe@@ ditions ( over the last , cas@@ et@@ su Y@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) into final spare @-@ houses .
after the thre@@ e@@ fold catastrophe almost 80@@ ,000 people were forced to live in homes .
in December 2016 there are still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such homes .
almost 40 percent of the Fu@@ kus@@ hima living in emergency shel@@ ters still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful at this occasion . more than 75 per cent of the evacu@@ ated accommodation , were res@@ trained in final houses after the disaster .
the number here is 34 per cent for I@@ w@@ ate .
pre@@ fec@@ tures of work and everyday work in the three pre@@ f@@ ect .
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by evil , their pen@@ for@@ es up to December 2016 , which makes nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three Pre@@ fec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while nearly 100 per cent of the Fischerei@@ hä@@ fen in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i have now been in operation again , at Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of the fishing h@@ ops have reg@@ ained their farm .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident occurred in the three pre@@ f@@ ect of agr@@ arian land of agr@@ arian and fer@@ o@@ dly .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent destroyed agricultural land can be used again in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear issue , since only 6@@ 90 hectares destroyed by 5 400 hectares destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are in the &quot; nuclear @-@ free zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of tourism the tourism has recovered and recovered far away , but Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains far off here .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again at 90 per cent at the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , on the other hand , can only afford 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that since the disaster was nearly half of the coastal inhabitants , it is harder to earn their living .
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to determine a total picture , the paper led numerous surveys under the native population and among the evacu@@ ated ones . she interviewed them about the state of re@@ building and also how their feeling has changed from the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents who have taken action to be prepared for future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those surve@@ yed that have not been done enough in cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention .
as it comes to those who had to evacu@@ ate the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ matur@@ ely
in her release on the anniversary of the earthquake , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has intensified its attention to the situation of the evacu@@ ation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima had not only to experience the enormous earthqu@@ akes and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ acher Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness of the worst , catastrop@@ hic , nuclear , atom@@ ized , the Japan had ever had to experience .
of 160 000 Americans from Fu@@ kus@@ hima almost 63 000 people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 there were slightly more than 23 000 people , returned to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in long @-@ term spare @-@ houses .
after the date of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside their home pre@@ fecture .
in disaster situations , most of the evacu@@ ations are still in expe@@ ditions , older than 50 years old . they will have to return to correct expe@@ ditions because efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects will have to compete , the part of the Olympics are to be held in Tokyo .
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
if one encounters people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the similarities .
after a while , one often recognizes that one more connects than it seems at first glance .
these global connections are important since they challenge our prejudices , expand our perspective and remind us that the world is ultimately quite small .
in this sequence of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with issues that often get less attention in reporting when they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the similarities between Greek and Turkish ; Li@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa explains how love for music has cor@@ rupted its affection for Iranian culture ; Adriana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time , where she worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in an artificial coma , after it was assembled by the police in nationwide demonstrations

Rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 has delivered this week to the intensive care unit : last Friday he had struck a police officer for a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a head@@ stock against the head . nationwide , millions of prot@@ esters participated in a protest against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a sk@@ ull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors made him this Saturday and now they have put him in an artificial kom@@ a .
his condition is regarded as critical .
the local journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which quickly spread itself within a few days rapidly in Brazil .
in the pictures also the face of the police officers can recognize , who attacked with a head@@ stock . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police have been announced in the Brazilian federal state of Go@@ i@@ ás that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until completion of an examination of the incident occurring by the active service .
the pictures show the police officers , as he suggests at Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
would a police spokes@@ man test by a prot@@ esters and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be six months on TV and the whole oppression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel by Media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video adopted by Lu@@ iz da Luz , in which one sees , as Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edic ends briefly on it .
another video with the same scenes , but from a different perspective , is also filmed in social networks .
in the clip shown below , one sees the attack on Mat@@ eus the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , we have donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) in order to cover part of the costs for the medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is hospital .
&quot; be tap@@ pers , Mat@@ eus .

the drawing was divided into several social networks several times .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activ@@ ist in Go@@ i@@ ás to the memory :
Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political power : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father , only to crimin@@ alise the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we have been attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who has been attacked on the intensive ward , after he has been attacked by a poli@@ cem@@ an who threw him face with a stroke .
police transfer rates
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil that in which the police applied first Friday to brutal police attempts against demonstrators .
polic@@ emen sat at the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstrators had built a stage for speakers , rubber @-@ stories and lac@@ ri@@ mal .
the MEP Fla@@ vio J@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , the police asked the speaker to renoun@@ ce violence against demonstrators .
this also includes a report at Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country .
once again , the Brazilian media prot@@ esting str@@ apping by putting the focus on another , unexpected protagon@@ ists : a wind@@ shield .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo deliberately reported about a break glass windows to be illustr@@ ative with a photo of their front @-@ pages .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o prefer@@ ed a title story with a set @-@ in @-@ set bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic basis , more about a broken wind@@ shield as above the protests of thousands who serve the defense of a special cause .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must also recognize if one is strictly against any form of appropri@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here , the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; will also get an absurd , dis@@ proportionate effect , and the typical violence of military police are recorded by headlines with the title &quot; demonstrators on confrontation with the police . &quot;
the un@@ troubled villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba included the doors ( photo : Julio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the parish community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I , located in the western Cub@@ an Province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - well @-@ known , regardless of the fact that there are no appreci@@ able sugar harv@@ ested locally .
it is two years ago when the activities were laid in the sugar cane factories .
after the return , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost gradually and after its installations , until only the sc@@ aff@@ old left of steel and concrete remained .
approximately 2@@ 72 workers were forced to re@@ invent itself .
some may be altern@@ ated the job .
other res@@ ig@@ ni@@ ers and com@@ mu@@ te daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a Sol@@ di@@ veteran , which is charged every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar cane industry is not depri@@ ving of his sleep .
he heard that there is in the east of the sugar cane factories , which after a long in@@ active time it returned into operation , because they were obtained .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene remembered exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I would get the cane sugar factory , but the promise has not been kept .
the cane industry already contradic@@ ted the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market price , the in@@ efficiency , the poor administrative decisions and climate change .
by 2016 , the production was 1.@@ 6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced .
the news would have been a motive for alarm for the country some decades ago , but the bad harvest was not news anymore .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar cane industry switched ?
the old railway station of the church saw already a better time .
( photo : Julio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane fabri@@ cation were technically outdated , and hardly competitive they were in@@ toler@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate on the production on the most efficient factories , the annual production capacity was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories , which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives , which led to such measures were the small productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the rise in the world market .
nevertheless the sugar price rose more than a decade ago .
from 2017 until 20@@ 25 the price of un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound will be published , according to the 2016 report &quot; agricultural perspectives &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Economic and Nutrition United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.@@ 6 million tonnes ) , the gross export would be about 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day with certainty in history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
in the following years the lac@@ tation of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people got their full salary for further education .
the same happened at the sugar factory Greg@@ orio Arl@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closing of the factory , is the word he is most repeated , &quot; fraud . &quot;
almost all those questioned are the same opinion : not one of them has been informed that the factory would be shut down .
hence the place will be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first end year , the first letters started to come .
it was officially distributed documents that were only removed in relation to the parts which would be removed , the addres@@ see and the date differ@@ ed .
all were signed by Ul@@ an Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could author@@ ise any decision .
from there the responsibility was over and the letters were becoming more frequent .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the be@@ z@@ ily factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still in operation of the sugar mills . &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another facility , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved against his will in the st@@ agnation of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with every part , which he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of work .
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important job producers has been eliminated .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for working conditions and services that the systems de@@ generated in the communities in which they were created .
we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut speech of 21 October 2002 , the then President in the eyes of the present persons saw , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane
since 2004 the sugar cane has been extracted only highly through M@@ ole .
( photo : Julio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the Municipality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I , that many things change , but not always for the better , if a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane joined , or better said than they began to dis@@ credit it , they also listened to the road , these are disadvantaged also other farms .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy have had to look for other factories .
they have been divided into spare parts .
without a perspective , many young people left the region as well .
the area was created in the area , whose production serves not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma back to the ruins of the place where he began working .
almost forty @-@ four@@ fold harvest for the old soldiers of two thousand Pes@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a person @-@ carrying person , yet he gives the lies that one told him not .
they have been tor@@ ment it for ten years .
N@@ ene is staying in R@@ ente , not because it lacks a force , but because it is bitter .

first Nations young people use hip @-@ Hop to express themselves and preserve their own culture
a song by &quot; Home to Me &quot; - assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission from N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
youth of the First Nations communities in Canada are dealing with issues that are important to them . they do they using hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , Bosch has been producing mobile studios directly at schools and youth centres in 2014 to teach young audiences such as song@@ writing , recording , audi@@ o- and video production and live appearances .
the original workshops were guided by the pedago@@ gues of David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and in North @-@ Quebec with ten cre@@ e @-@ communities and then working with the Cre@@ e Hi@@ p Hop group The North@@ Stars .
the workshop is in a way that the young participants in talks such as &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self acceptance or whatever they want to come into mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youngsters are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian Province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ac@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the kite @-@ Calabri@@ an First Nation in British Columbia , for example , called the History of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered .
the cases were largely unknown .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the moti@@ f of a video player to convey to how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite influences by globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people are not always doub@@ t@@ ful in the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has been recorded , the chorus of Cre@@ e is sung .
the young people involved here received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from North@@ land Hi@@ p Hop Group , who gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in dialect of Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ side of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an is available to verses in trans@@ cription , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German here :
sometimes I feel as if none would ever be interested in me .
but I try to go on Earth for my days
this is the day when you get to know our scre@@ am
because we have lost our way in life as youth
but I believe that we will be raising one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life

in Japan one can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , are located near the entrance Ho@@ ku@@ to san@@ pur@@ u ( &apos; the &apos; plastic models of the dishes &apos; ) from every dish that is served in this restaurant .
the customers look at these plas@@ tic@@ ists , and then decide whether they enter or continue the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
in the current part of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a large number of these small businesses that produce just those three @-@ dimensional dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders started in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over twenty years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even perceive them any more . a new trend is turning it into striking mobile phone accessories and other gadgets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published series of social media links and photos , which make this unusual twist with the sho@@ ku@@ to san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new with plastic @-@ made mobile lig@@ aments , as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store .
many of these artificial foods were turned into mosquito nets , as in this case , cool@@ ed cup@@ board magnets :
here are a couple of sho@@ eing c@@ rank@@ board magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of the ess@@ ences is becoming increasingly complex .
in this case a ca@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular travel bowl with seafood ) turned into a mobile phone ring .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile phone rings .
we also made this part in Tokyo for the exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple that keeps your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a candle for the mobile , this is already a great design .
and that is just the beginning of an increasing approach to the com@@ ic .
some mobile devices and mobile @-@ designers allow you to make your own work of art . in this case i@@ kur@@ a or salmon @-@ o@@ estrogen is used , a popular t@@ opping which is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubt :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there someone who would say there : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can release my mobile phone with salmon @-@ ro@@ gens ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will probably be the only one .
this interest in plastic geri@@ atric may also assume a less appetite form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest cell phone @-@ stands has the form of mel@@ ted ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon .
you can see more sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plasma dishes at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter using the h@@ ash@@ tag # Test@@ ing over to the package .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi who is dedicated to the Bel@@ ie@@ vement of the restaurant industry . as for example , with the sho@@ ku@@ to san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
an Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the struggle against drug dealers . &quot;

in reports at home and foreign media on the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trafficking , &quot; in Mexico the Ver@@ bl@@ est and Get@@ ö@@ ckers regularly gather in statistics . however these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy which this struggle will bring .
the reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the leader of the sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ cart@@ els , thrust the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background .
a day after a violent incident hardly anybody looks to the dream or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
in doing so , behind every cor@@ pse , behind each bon@@ ding is in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories innumerable parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never heal .
that is why the Mexican real estate site Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico the@@ digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with drug trafficking &apos; lives and stories of people who are told through the struggle between law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els .
Animal pol@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organised crime not only lets us fear our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
for example , if stores are closing , because they are threatened by drug retailers and therefore need to drive whole churches so many kilometres to buy something as cre@@ eping like milk .
pain of victims
a video titled &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian por el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; ( german language : &quot; as fear lives changed &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
one main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who has kept secret tom@@ bs after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost only one day their father , their four si@@ blings , their husband and two of their ne@@ phe@@ w .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ ests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today again for the task we have placed to go to , and to graves after the people we loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is named Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 , when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in a power shop in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on 13th October he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Gu@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very hard for me because I am now alone with three children who need education . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my m@@ um that is here with me too .
at the moment it has no income .
you are taking out the insurance of my father , but that doesn &apos;t get it off because that require a ster@@ ling certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get the one ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editors of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ ac con el Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explain why the project is so important : &quot; &quot; &quot;
we don &apos;t only have to show the faces of those who are afraid of . we have to show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the government .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a les@@ bian from Animal pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post in Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered as normal , regardless of what form it appears :
I have been familiar with disease and sensation journ@@ alism for several years now .
I &apos;m coming to newspaper publishing every day and see the front pages with pictures , which actually only can come from a textbook on crimin@@ ology or from files of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only ones that am hin@@ dered or sad . it acts like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to that body .
I cannot be in@@ different here or consider it to be normal .
it continues to write :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if he is great . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the offen@@ ders &quot; when going through the streets .
for me that &apos;s how would they infl@@ ate those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happened to them .
I see our weakness if stories to mere figures become statistics in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ som@@ nia of the people is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students are justified in a neighbouring village that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; auf@@ äs@@ sig &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to talk about being spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies if they are not stir@@ red and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City was scre@@ ened the post &quot; four months black@@ mail@@ in the main city district : how a family has been lo@@ oted by threats , &quot; in it describes how armed criminal month had grown up for month money from their business until it was destroyed not only the business but also their family was torn apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the ache over it passes never , the trau@@ ma stays , the fear comes back high once you are alone .
habits have changed , telephone numbers as well .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the further we are from each other , the better .
she excluded her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will de@@ tract or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days if wines would resolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the reply is no , because I forgot how to cri@@ es . I must learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the post &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : one of the recorded generation of violence . &quot;
in the introduction he thro@@ ws questions on how : who cares about the child of an missed wife and a man who was murdered by the organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous town of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is a guard and he tells he had to teach himself how to cook a egg , potatoes s@@ own , tor@@ tillas warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk pul@@ ver@@ ages .
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy who consists of violence and had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother has disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood has been past two years earlier , when he was just a few blocks from his home , who saw the bloody trap of his father , shot by armed men out of a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez was like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of the kill@@ ings for public security and government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the pro@@ secutor of 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this equ@@ ates to 8.@@ 5 Mor@@ den per day .
these are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of thousands that organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
only a few stories live in the face of more and more recent headlines . but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; animal journ@@ alism project called Nar@@ co@@ data in existence , whose objective is to tor@@ mented the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking in which the country has tor@@ tured in the last four decades in an understandable way .
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from the Flickr user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) warning : this article and the sites to which he linked , contains images , on which violence is shown .
the fact @-@ check is important in a moment when it comes to up@@ lifting a rum@@ our or for@@ f@@ lar@@ ing a for@@ gery .
but how is the year after something the first time has appeared ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to persist .
let &apos;s take this picture of a terrible accident involving seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first release , it has been used to treat trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in terminology from Global Vo@@ ices or First D@@ raft News - does not deny the fact that there is abundant reporting about events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our longing for pictures to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 a petrol trucks ent@@ ailed the place San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ cked off and explo@@ ded . in doing so , 230 people came to life .
after the civil war Africa became a second @-@ largest country for years and thereby devast@@ ated . the roads in the region became a dangerous path@@ ways full of po@@ thol@@ es who were difficult to walk .
l@@ lo@@ gically , that the petrol station fell victim to the victim .
official representatives described a fire@@ ball , the end @-@ cleaning houses including a movie theaters in the vicinity , which was full of people who looked at the World Cup .
houses pl@@ ast@@ ed and black@@ ened cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets scattered .
many people were burned to the imm@@ ac@@ tical .
a picture with the title &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Multi@@ ere photos of the incident form the gray @-@ scale scen@@ eries of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of hollow bodies that are ranked on the ground while people watch them .
but the story here is not its end .
over the years , the same picture has been tam@@ pered with several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , and are not mistaken in connection with the trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am on the remote @-@ Nig@@ erian towns B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses caused a dr@@ astic increase of atrocities that they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and cor@@ pse were in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody stayed back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a resident to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images , the following time could be visu@@ alized .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army ai@@ ded in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict @-@ conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt at Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from the Democratic Republic of the Congo , when it was presented as proof of the fact and the potential extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris .
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this improper use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ fortun@@ es ; Africa check has documented as@@ orders for Nigeria since 2014 .
in all of these cases the picture was presented as a test@@ ament to mass kill@@ ings .
one step further brings personal comments such as the image from DR Congo , with sources of mass media in relation to arguments .
the picture from San@@ ge joined in Myanmar with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya .
according to a flash review , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee bands , rape and several deaths , some by burning .
while others reported by the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts , such as the following , who made these proposals with photos from the Democratic Republic of the Congo :
this picture comes from a sau@@ di @-@ Arab news site that said in 2012 , the President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein Sein said , monks and politicians would have participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image taken from the DR Congo to capture this information .
the original contribution , which was last used on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organisations , who called AF@@ P as their source , had also mistak@@ enly Th@@ ein Sein and this statement , but did not make the picture taken out of the DR Congo .
the global reach of false information
traces of this false coupling reach back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far more borders can be exceed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a revers@@ ed picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 images found in the said image from the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
they come from a mixture of private pages , platforms of social media and community , as well as national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek , and Portuguese .
some have passed wrong reports , many have tried to expos@@ ing counter@@ fe@@ iting .
we have indicated instances for the abuse of abuse and associated with the respective countries , based on which side they had been published . thus , we want to make the reach more clearly than by language alone .
the countries below ( which were connected with each other in some cases ) can be used several examples of improper use .
here are some cases that can now be fully resolved now ( on the map in Orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
examples of exaggerated cou@@ pl@@ ings of the picture taken from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange @-@ colored countries point to pages or servers , are still available through the examples of counter@@ fe@@ iting or fal@@ cons .
the countries in Gray are examples , which , according to the metadata and information , are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also counter@@ fe@@ iting .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( directed at Algeri@@ an and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Buddh@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this article , a blo@@ gger from Quebec City is not only the wrong message , but also discussed the abuse of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria , as well as continuing questions about the intentions of the persons and the trage@@ dies in it in the Democratic Republic of Congo and beyond .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los Cr@@ isti@@ anos &quot; ( In Nigeria they burn the Christians ) .
in this article on explo@@ sions in North @-@ Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ blica , the district is identified as the Christian part of the place .
La Rep@@ ú@@ blica is cited as its source of the Spanish news agency e@@ fe ( which is not known , whether the original report included the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
T@@ wit@@ ter@@ contributions from the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am massacre , like this one here , who used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; outra@@ ges of Islam &quot; have clearly seen no pages such as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster who viol@@ ates this .

a resident of the old@@ town partly Pie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o from Tren@@ to po@@ unded this message to its page to express its solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria the picture was divided as proof of the bom@@ b@@ ings of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am in the can@@ o in the public discussion .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of an abu@@ sive use of the picture from DR Congo , on the one hand a twe@@ et , the sympathy of the Nig@@ erian massacre , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the alleg@@ ations , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persecuted , to be deli@@ timi@@ ze , since the photos were used improper .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government released a statement on what it presented as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visi@@ bly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; news and photos , international media , international human rights organisations and governments gathered in an attempt to create confusion about Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sing@@ le@@ book , which has been published exclusively in English , also contains references to counter@@ f@@ eit images of sc@@ aff@@ ections , which H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operate and used by extrem@@ ist groups to declare that Muslims unite Buddhist and to the other direction ( which is often reported by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
Russia , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ TT &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ ophobia or political pro@@ vocation ? ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this post , which directed itself to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clari@@ fies that the image of DR Congo is NOT Muslim .
Saudi @-@ Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page asser@@ ted that the president of Myanmar Th@@ ein be cons@@ ented in 2012 that monks and politicians have been involved in the kill@@ ings of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought together the story with the image from San@@ ge .
the article was updated in 2014 and the picture continues to contain it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 about students who had been killed by the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , published by the now deleted news page An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , expressly cons@@ ents that the image is not derived from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it had a &quot; similar sp@@ leen &quot; attack .
when the picture rose later in connection with the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am massacre , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to resist that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ali Yan@@ y@@ or@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ yu@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burned the world ) .
the picture taken by the DR Congo ( DRC ) provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and del@@ etes a discussion among Muslims under the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 and the proposal on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to make sure that their communities found these events , that they took gu@@ essed in the name of Islam , have paid a greater attention .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as evidence of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 by Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 men saved ) . but the messages that were associated with it were raised in no religious context .
the goal was to focus attention to the relative number of dead and a comparison of media reports compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was alleged to have been written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; over the Nig@@ erian massacre , we took a discussion like this here in Vietnamese and explained to the wrong message .
from the Embassy in which the image was contained in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ fed Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos .
there are further confirmed examples of faul@@ ty use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
at other accounts , ag@@ gregation and pages in the following countries ( on the work@@ book in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye has progres@@ sed , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / file tim@@ est@@ amps exist on the web@@ portal and harmon@@ izing them via image file related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya . )
in all of these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original lap@@ se of 2010 , the image may finally have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( fr@@ aming ) that crosses these po@@ ets . the first frame is focused on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions on the silence of Christians by Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the assass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Buddh@@ ists .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how a African life is valued as compared to a European or French life .
religion is to understand and the value of human life is both important and therefore it is worth investig@@ ating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question is , however , what happens when readers can no longer believe this painting .
with social media there are people who have un@@ inten@@ tionally taken part of doing the water around a tragedy .
suggests this mood of the mis@@ - and mis@@ cre@@ denti@@ al that actual atrocities are un@@ true and nar@@ ered it the actual Gre@@ ys of what actually happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ?
the spread of cl@@ amped images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that returning from images of a ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even called by the victims itself .
at the same time , the concern is that violent paintings readers and viewers des@@ ensi@@ tise , and they have the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( for example , this study , which examined how violent media act to help others ) .
while there are some regarding violent depic@@ tions in the news media , the fact is that it is indispensable for today &apos;s news reports .
Techn@@ ologist is experimenting with algorithms to assist the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . you will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something that can actually be abol@@ ished from the context or completely mis@@ used species .
any examination of false subsidies should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Blog reveals the uniqueness of smaller languages
photos of Andy Sim@@ mons uses according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. re@@ plac@@ eable ) tries to offer language skills a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to be translated at all .
such words exist in each language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these insur@@ moun@@ table words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese su@@ ction ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( such as the Spanish so@@ bre@@ m@@ esa ) .
but they all resist each attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a word or expression is not sufficient , why a full explanation and sometimes some context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and Lingu@@ ist von &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find for example words from the Mw@@ ot@@ ene language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as :

how Sri Lanka gets along with the worst g@@ ut@@ eness of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood of floods in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually starts at the end of May , are the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country over the shore .
after an opinion of the disaster centre of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missed due to the floods and s@@ laugh@@ tering waves .
over 400 000 people have been hit by last Friday ( 26 May ) and around 100 000 people were killed on 30@@ 4 safe locations .
the rainy season on Saturday ( 27th May ) gradually , and the waters in some areas went slowly back .
health and hygiene in the communities represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following photos and videos give an impression of the scale of the catastrop@@ hic flood :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water @-@ conditions of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates on the flood situation .
many use the H@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly fluid wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue crisis , warns Save the Children after more rainf@@ alls are already on their way .
today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in flood , water stood up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da with G@@ alle also flooded because of the yesterday overweight pe@@ el of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has made five aircraft for rescue operations and further five are completed for transport of emergency supplies to the inhabitants adopted in their flooded villages .
various organisations and star@@ tu@@ ps have also explained to assist .
Facebook pages like Help F@@ lood Vic@@ tory in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka deliver important information on flood situation and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue missions require d@@ ron@@ es for their operations , please call the number 0@@ 7@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and li@@ vable goods for flood victims -

&quot; &quot; &quot; likewise , they introduced a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; key , which had more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat reactions to be launched for floods and lands@@ li@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Dam@@ as in January I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and a dear friend .
I trust her four year old daughter , she trust me her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in one minute we call for slo@@ gans for the rights of women .
in the next sk@@ ar@@ - we address rights for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of Um@@ br@@ ellas and people , some keep the iconic picture of a woman with a head scar@@ f , bound by a American flag , other sk@@ ating par@@ ole against Islam@@ ophobia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend watches me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Mus@@ lim@@ a ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask myself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar , which they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their performance .
you are Muslim .
there are 1,@@ 7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different ways but somehow we all put in the same Muslim Dra@@ wer .
this dra@@ wer is so well designed in our collective imagination such as Muslims , which as I don &apos;t fit into it .
Muslim als become
I am not alone with that .
this even has happened to the poet , whose poetry in America is selling : Rum@@ i .
which images do you come to mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when j@@ al@@ alu@@ dd@@ in Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was a orthodox Pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran , and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the Western presentation , religion is deleted , as did the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of the 1.@@ 7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists of the frag@@ ility pictures of Muslims , Western books have been coloni@@ alist already for centuries .
this temp@@ ting pron@@ unciation is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman one should save .
the landmark Palestinian American scientist Edward S@@ aid fired the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these images continue to rise further today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood remain constant .
I have worked for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how these powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ r@@ ative dominate our news@@ letters .
this fo@@ rati@@ os du@@ o@@ vers@@ had@@ ows the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries while the United States could not even choose their first female candidate .
this Nar@@ c@@ v fails to recognize that when French , Muslim women are prevented from carrying their head blan@@ ket in public buildings and to cover acid Arab , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , which both are both sides of the same coin .
a powerful group exercises its &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead the movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on the American ground of Afri@@ cans who have been associated with slave @-@ ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this narrative has created our collective imagination such deeply and fla@@ wed , that often Si@@ kh @-@ men and children become the aim of anti @-@ militar@@ ist attacks and ra@@ ids .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because of these stories we tell and about the way we tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ophobia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1,@@ 7 billion belonging to the 1,@@ 7 billion
in the news industry , we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts .
or at alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative who help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to grasp the fo@@ rati@@ os of the 1.@@ 7 billion .
and we have failed to achieve that seven million Muslims in the highest degree make up various &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
over a third of the entire Muslim people are African @-@ speaking Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation coming from 77 countries .

four decades ago my old parents came in New York to live their American dream .
my mother put her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the skyscrapers of New York . skyscr@@ aper were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then when Khan was re@@ thought of the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ f@@ aded Muslims and Americans .
but am I now un@@ hin@@ der Mus@@ lim@@ a and American ?
sometimes when people ask why I don &apos;t eat pig meat , I say - instead of raising my Muslim recipes or get my hand@@ writing pocket , which all Muslims carry with him - &quot; for respect from Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I jo@@ kes , we do not wear all the flas@@ hy with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must also be any the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or to almost always be selected at the airport almost always . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter @-@ religious activists , who strive to fight far @-@ widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced on the current volume of a well @-@ secured Islam@@ ophobia , thinking tanks and experts for false information , which is our already faul@@ ty picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories that we tell and , because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ ophobia lead to more than just a stranger who nar@@ row@@ ly the head of a woman to a woman .
or as the scary card of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole US , see below .
scre@@ enshot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ophobia in its ugly forms attacks our affili@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it attacks our identity , which is so dense , so versatile and multi @-@ lay@@ ered , that it would be impossible to fit into a dra@@ wer .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was born then into my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when Soci@@ ologist relate to religious life , they refer back to the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my mus@@ li@@ faith faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my friend , my neighbour , my neighbor in the surf , see that I am Mus@@ lim@@ a when they could look through the 15 feet concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the all@@ ab@@ omin@@ able ritual with my daughter , if I am mine in my arms and her the Arabic verses for the protection of fle@@ eting , which defeat the Koran , and which Q@@ ul@@ s are called .
each of them repeat three times .
I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one you can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith is perhaps not always visible , but my Muslim adher@@ ence is always part of my shadow .

it is the picture of it that I can conclude at this moment when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by their full and un@@ finished paintings of Su@@ fi saint ; and one grain with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that can mem@@ ori@@ ze them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ lim@@ a means to be able to speak the prayers they had told me when I have a bad day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ lim@@ a is to be as she taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a nation , which was founded over centuries - by an &quot; Empire &quot; , which has founded a company with the name Ven@@ erable British Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Komp@@ anie , it has a deep meaning , God , my only Lord .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans all have become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colonial countries &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was rejected by a Muslim country in a century ago .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , Kash@@ mir@@ ic sub @-@ tan of the British Empire , was designated by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous , &quot; as it led the first mosque in England .
still before there were planes he travelled to more parts of the world when I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion people go deep into our unforgettable family rooms ; our un@@ plug@@ ged story .
it means remembering that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops being distributed over every continent , apart from Antar@@ c@@ tica , have gone into Iraq to chase mass destruction weapons that did not exist .
it means knowing that over half a million Iraq were buried under the rub@@ ble of the war .
being an American Mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that the su@@ ici@@ dal rate has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means to know that when a tragedy has res@@ sed the US and carrying a Muslim name that tells the story four times more than a story with a white attacks .
it means knowing that four ten years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slaves with the name Bil@@ al .
it means to know that two hundred years ago a African , an African , Islamic Islam@@ ist , was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country two hundred years ago .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .

it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life count .
an American woman , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ i , a Kash@@ mir@@ i , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Pun@@ lim@@ a and a journalist means the in@@ tougher inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our multi@@ ples possible identities , but to fail to communicate them to others .
the narrative of the 1,@@ 7 billion contains more possibilities than a sor@@ cer@@ c@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , but it is represented in the redu@@ ci@@ ering divisions &quot; we are against &quot; them . &quot;
to be a mother means to care of my child and all the Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that impot@@ ent and privileged people on this du@@ ly could establish structural hos@@ tility .
structural and hos@@ tility consists in the Muslim registr@@ ars who began with President Bush and have been extended by President Obama .
it consists in perme@@ able monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of the immigration officer that takes a five year old child into hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it exists in a country that closes its borders with people from just the countries that it bombar@@ ded .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly list , &quot; which is largely Arabs and Muslims in the sight .
it is the wars that we lead and the bombs which we throw at Muslim countries .
because of the stories that we tell and about what we do not tell , we are here today .
in a study with the title A@@ scent of Man , scientists of the North@@ western University have a scientifically unacceptable picture and asked them to judge groups on a scale ranging from 1 to 100 on the evolution .

we are too deep dar@@ ed to ab@@ stain from the Muslim or the &quot; other . &quot;
we are back decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous image prints , which we have in our news @-@ editors .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which attempts to realize our frequently seen identities and forgotten history .

but I am concerned because of this difficult global point in which we are .
and that moment has consequences , which go beyond the 1.@@ 7 billion .
there is one reason that the conspiracy the@@ or@@ ist , which existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now the White House .
they have grown exp@@ on@@ entially because they have made Muslims led to &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ entially by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years ago , it had not existed yet ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history of which I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but who today made me a un@@ miss@@ able Muslim .
things I left behind in my speech like a bread@@ cru@@ ising track .
things that may spark back memories , because in all the inter@@ sections which constitutes our humanity like a story , where someone is made to another &quot; other . &quot;

why do I tel this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and caused by creating the &quot; other &quot; in the public eye , four decades ago was the Stan@@ ford of Stan@@ ford .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of this , consciously and un@@ consciously here@@ to , as it &apos;s my girlfriend and I in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the employment that we have no president while he already started native countries and &apos; to others made &quot; people bom@@ bed , far beyond the visible and invisible 1,@@ 7 billion .
it begins with all of us .
initiative for narr@@ ator @-@ art wants to preserve urban knowledge diversity
story stories , of Flickr users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be an opportunity to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) the enumer@@ ation of stories in their original language is the possible response to it .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird , the un@@ predictable blog .
here however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of large cities .
in fact , urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already conducted events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite as small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the makers of the project the following applies :
the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that have diversity - safe spaces in which inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to be part of .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen often with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refer to these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to estimate , to feel , to make . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format you can tell and translate their story first in their own language , or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional dance @-@ stor@@ yt@@ eller , their devotion and presentation make sure that the audience is getting into it .
they call laughter and emotions when the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video illustrates for example a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the story @-@ stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou can also be explained the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative of the stories .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the tale of hare and the Pavi@@ an in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the meaning of his tale , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is that to speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide smile , he shares his sense of inclu@@ siveness :
you have listened !
you were attentive ...
they were entirely with me !
up to now , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities and the organizers hope to expand this out . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS in order to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers .
Puerto Rico demands from the US to re @-@ establishment of the sovereign debt
with the goal of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , who participated in 72 million US dollars , on the past 3rd April 2017 , several religious and civil organizations participated in a mass demonstration , the march began at the pu@@ er@@ t@@ ori@@ American Capit@@ ol , the Government building of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
it was declared by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano por la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Civil War for the Neur@@ inspection of debts ) and of the O@@ kom@@ en@@ ical Church meeting in Puerto Ric@@ os .
the inter@@ c@@ essors of the ren@@ unciation of debts have also submitted a petition on the official home page of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os calls for politicians , ban@@ kers and government agencies responsible for debts , to their corrupt to their corrupt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial test and a mission @-@ committee without personal interest in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions appropriate remuner@@ ation which acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will be black@@ ened and sup@@ pressed .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not theirs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our reti@@ re@@ es will not be found with decl@@ ining profitability .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not into the governmental alliance of the United States - suffer from a severe financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organisation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law on social responsibility , as an alternative to an existing State of State .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the outside imposed measures without the participation and conviction of citizens to be risk , rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demonstration carried the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

the Sy@@ r@@ isch @-@ Palestinian web developer of K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , is missing for more than one year .

more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he did for an open network .

the book , which was published last year and is here licence @-@ free , contains a number of papers that deal with the free culture in the face of repression .
it is a homage to bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction there is :
this book will discuss how movements can be built for free knowledge , and what the real costs are , with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers and writers , who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have worked on page to go through the fog that surrounds our news@@ letters and to create something from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free bas@@ sel K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and sophisticated Internet volunteers , which has been de@@ tained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was painted from the A@@ dra @-@ prison directory in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or residence .
the introductory part of his book with the title of collective remembrance gives his friends and family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom .
seeing how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us start to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we decide for what did we decide for ?
what have we abandoned in this process of time @-@ wise convic@@ tions ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in jail for March 2012 in custody system government agencies .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; base bases on the basis of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secret &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; signed command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported , she was contacted on 12 November 2015 by people who presented themselves as the in@@ sider of the Assad administration and took note of a alleged death sentence against her husband .
his where@@ ab@@ outs and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , has played a crucial role to expand access to internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Techn@@ ologist and at the moment passed the Director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded the Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ que cultural prototypes were pres@@ cient than the work he began with a group of arche@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins Pal@@ my@@ ra virtually .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites of the world , was the trail of many civilizations and here merge Greek @-@ Roman architecture @-@ types with local traditions and Persian influences .
then , Bas@@ sel was not able to know that ten years after he started with this work , the IS would put everything in it , this architecture that is not only em@@ bodied by the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this for@@ ay in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time@@ frame which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bas@@ sel was not able to complete this project so far .
N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I &apos;ve spent my whole life with it , of freedom to dream and ba@@ it taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhelmed when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English in even when he was in custody .
I learned to read English well , write and speak .
he always shared his knowledge with each one who asked . he has taught other de@@ tain@@ ees to read and speak English .
Bas@@ sel has opened my door to the technology . he taught me to use both computer and smartphones .
he brought the internet to me .
he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theoretically without they actually kept a holding in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ clamation , which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura have worked together in the book for a year .
she put the texts to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic to English .
the book is available license @-@ free .

the book is dedicated to public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a by the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :
it is happening with every visit ,
that in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the mind in the moment we embrace it ,
that any of the haz@@ ards doesn &apos;t matter .
any of the f@@ ences , fet@@ ters and watch@@ man
I forget the che@@ ering of the prison
and I jump into every detail of your voice and words .
I carry my passion with me
when your eyes are well saying
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my lon@@ eliness ,
to take back all the moments ,
and about your absence to cry and smile .
I persu@@ aded myself , that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bas@@ sel wrote G@@ ha@@ zi :

I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of Monster
Bas@@ tion History is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests in 2011 the regime of Bashar al @-@ Assad is the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) more than 6@@ 5,000 people disappeared .
those who were arrested or scr@@ ap@@ ed under violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
until 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans in jail .
the stories of many other people are unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of bas@@ sel for 2012 .
today we repeat our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambique : because of corruption im@@ ur@@ anium director after release , release back to pre@@ occupied post
Mozambique re@@ acted to a cor@@ rup@@ ture with anger , and a governmental member after half of his sentence returned to the workplace in the state apparatus , where the corruption was committed .
they were arrested by Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and four other def@@ endants in 2010 ( about 800 000 Euros ) sentenced to 22 years imprisonment .
the money was from public funds of the airports of Mozambique , whose advice Cam@@ ba@@ za stood between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 due to good guidance and immediately asked his re@@ inst@@ at@@ ement to the company what happened on 19th April .
in accordance with an opinion of the General Physi@@ cal Law of the Republic of the Republic , the application for granted , there would be no obstacles for Cam@@ ba@@ za to come back to his old positions , as the company doesn &apos;t re @-@ establish a disciplinary treatment after his detention .
however , many residents do not mean the action well .
the Center for Public integrity ( Centro de Integr@@ ated da@@ de P@@ ú@@ blica , briefly C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned in an interview with the Deutsche Welle rel@@ ying the decision of the company to restore the director again :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a backward step with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we take note is that the company should have supposed to have a discipl@@ in@@ arity against the res@@ ists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the company apparently led and anchor no adequate legal steps to apply the appropriate functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , an important voice in the Mos@@ aic social media , this behaviour also decl@@ ines and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be a consultant , after he was sentenced to a prison , and half has drow@@ ned .
he could give paid lectures and motiv@@ ating dis@@ courses , he could advise and pol@@ ishing his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to integrate into the company that he helped harm .
therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
contradic@@ ting !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , Young Mos@@ ambique and Student der Political Science in Brazil says , the director makes no mor@@ als :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he ins@@ ul@@ ted him , I can not believe someone was rewarded in such a way that the state has already been offen@@ ded so massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks morality and serve the State , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the State , but instead serves only by the State .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as hand is an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and ultimately sentenced to a long prison .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mak@@ e@@ el , to remind that a th@@ ief is in jail :
ie@@ ves belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ ines will not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a scar@@ let , inter@@ sec@@ ting and - incidentally - proph@@ esi@@ ed speakers .
one of his most famous oral representations was , when he proved energetic , that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of everything , also the father@@ land for its ambition , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not that way . he changes the tactics , but he does not approach his ambitions .
a ambitious man is a criminal &quot; at the same time . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also back@@ rest :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat down for ten years and came free .
and today it sets it the company where he with@@ drew money again , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ ass@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ ated Performance Collec@@ tive ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017

&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook is blocking the racial word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; means ti@@ ck@@ pe@@ se or sp@@ her@@ edi@@ se .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net , because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East @-@ Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ jective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Indian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or &apos; Rec@@ ord@@ al font ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma into the social network .
in the last few years , the rise of radical national movements has given the word an extremely @-@ expect@@ ant con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that mostly used from ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically appeal to hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed in the purpose of his use have been cens@@ ored .
furthermore there are several bur@@ ial words with fundamental different meanings , which have the same code as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair on Bur@@ m@@ ically also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; written , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &apos; ( sp@@ her@@ b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different meanings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends has been deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way whether she knew how he could allevi@@ ate his back pain by doing a word@@ play .
the S@@ ku la - &quot; curing &quot; ( ku ) + the Fra@@ ge@@ word ( la ) on Bur@@ mes@@ o - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that she would be comb@@ at@@ ting hate language more radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook will be analy@@ tic that it would be any Po@@ sts , who are in suspicion of racism .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ tered the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm is not understood what you write to fac@@ ades .
what it should do instead is to analyze the mail carefully and control it by checking the next words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the good is that these three @-@ legged nation@@ alists who spread hate speech , get a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to cur@@ vy its nationalism .
while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who dissemin@@ ate hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long .
the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have proven that the cens@@ or@@ ship of keywords often will start a cat@@ amaran and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply to start to use a new word or an alternative writing @-@ wise word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to clear his posts as he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; banned from the social network :
... when I got attentive to this new directive from Facebook , I made a mail to tell my Facebook friends that the Word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited the Li@@ ken , post and sharing of content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; Post community does not ent@@ ailed the Facebook community . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of po@@ ets from people who have no negative intentions or which simply try to show their opinions against hate speech more radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech by Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his mind about why extreme nationalism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine thinks that Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese internet community ask for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to l@@ essen racism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cens@@ or@@ ably such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems as if it had started this without local context or technical support and so words like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ as curr@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they have made mistakes , they don &apos;t tried to correct the adul@@ ter@@ ated posts .
if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits that they have a great turnover , it would be great .
fac@@ ades automatic cens@@ or@@ ship has ensured a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make themselves funny and know the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network .
here you can see some screen@@ shots from Facebook Po@@ sts , which contained no hate speech but nevertheless removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and look as an inheritance curr@@ y and take a look at an Indian film .
just to check if Facebook is the Post , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
scre@@ enshot with permission used .
the post States &quot; If you are a doctor , do you cure people ? &quot;
scre@@ enshot with permission used .
in the last five years extreme nationalist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence .
among other things , hate speech is to sanc@@ tify the violence in the churches in Myanmar , in addition , particularly in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Buddh@@ ists have forced thousands of escape .
Facebook was critici@@ zed for its failure , who critici@@ zed hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ical pages under control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but instead of simply using the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it would have been better running to concentrate rather on the context of code of concentrated initiatives and learned from them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is the end with the nursery .
a wedding ring in the sand .

the nursery is in Trinidad and Tobago for now .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament adopted unanim@@ ously at unanim@@ ity by the parliament , which is to ban this practice , so that the pag@@ an age is now at 18 .
prior to this amendment of the German Act , several members agreed to milit@@ arized and Muslim religious communities . at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leaders of the inter@@ religious organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group , the representatives of the various religious groups of the land gathered , that the state does not interfere , since that , age do not define the maturity . &quot;
this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contracting of the UN Human Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as , &quot; defined every human being under the age of 18 .
statistics from the UN in 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children which were already married with 15 , in Trinidad and Tobago for 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent .
in 2011 the statistical centre of the country confirmed that of 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys below 19 were married .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements , which strives to run laws on the nursery , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring this outcome .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no concerns to say about the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition provided for tension in this really complicated matter , and at some point came doubts as to whether the opposition would not agree to the bill of law .
at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided by law against children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of opposition and an independent , which could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country must agree and proc@@ laim the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the sen@@ ators of the country presented on Facebook a Status Update , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agram has posted :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill introduced against the children &apos;s marriage was held in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes against it and none other .
after he previously agreed in the Senate , the design can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws of child@@ birth have finally been changed .
Facebook @-@ member Lo@@ vell Francis , who disgu@@ ised a ministry in the Education Ministry , said :
it has done so much time and unnecessary talk that has van@@ ishes the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the nursery is in Trinidad and Tobago for now , and this is worth almost every prize .
while A@@ bel Jackson of the mind was , it was definitely long enough time to put the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come :
public status update on Facebook by Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , , Excellent news !
the spouses have been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ INA@@ D ) , a civil society group , which openly spoke openly about it , how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the pag@@ an age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious denom@@ inations 18 years .
the draft of the Act has been adopted today , on 9 June 2017 .
in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 members and of them 35 were present during the vote .
all MEPs who were against them have voted for the law .
children &apos;s marriage is no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ r@@ ind &apos; .
many thanks to all activists who have contributed him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our MEPs .
but a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj therefore , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dharma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organisation in the country .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take judicial steps , the law should be passed and he seems to make his promises now .
during the general Adv@@ oc@@ ate Paris Al @-@ wi , a prop@@ on@@ ent of the Act , said it would be quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj would act against the law , that most social media users would like to approach the debate differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so generally , in a way that only panic and melanch@@ oly may cause that the state , our daughters are protecting them that they are likely to be disp@@ le@@ ased by large , hard @-@ found men who are compared to them , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you believe that this is not a problem ?
yet whether or not it comes to a criminal action against the law , or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where children &apos;s before in different gra@@ dations are legal or the norm continues , though there are laws they say .

by the mir@@ rors of web pages , Turkish users can look back on Wikipedia content

for over a month Turkey has now moved the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based on crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based on Wikipedia .

although many techniques @-@ vers@@ ed Internet users used to use det@@ achments for blocked websites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third @-@ largest VPN @-@ prevalence of the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been posted since 2008 articles by Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; regular reporting of the internet since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
to China Turkey is the two @-@ known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked there are now several mir@@ ror@@ sites ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and often be updated ) .
one solution obtained from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ plan File System ) , when the platform put all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized Peer @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( so remote host connections ) which does not base itself on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ or@@ ship difficult .
the content is provided in spite of the legal ban .
in a blo@@ gger post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we have heard the news ( via the block@@ age of Wikipedia ) , we put everything in terms of sn@@ ap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the content on de@@ centralized and distributed manner .
this can help users to at least check all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the site www.@@ wikipedia.org .
IP@@ FS was also stated that this step is independent of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the web site .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos he saw around , never satisfied . they were blur@@ ry with poorly positioned motives and washed colors .
the motiv@@ ating him a camera to wear and try to straigh@@ ten the situation .
back then he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar to put themselves to the international stage at the age of 28 .
and his homeland is right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos , which direc@@ ting attention to Nep@@ alese wildlife .
he described on fac@@ ebook , like this first @-@ class situation in his work helps :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate game of wildlife ! !
I just rested from home when suddenly re@@ ap@@ ur@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that would be a leop@@ ard on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river river is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran out with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the leop@@ ard was lying and I immediately began to kne@@ eled pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar strives to co @-@ operation with the authorities to gain global recognition for Nepal &apos;s world and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not so scary as they look .
and he should know it because he was already standing on face from face to face :
a tiger can not distur@@ b from the opinion of the sheep not to sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
I was also at home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of Bu@@ he@@ k appeared . he immediately took care of us , we look forward to the Sal trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar is placed using the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I clicked on Environment ) in his photos .
but his passion for the advancement of Nep@@ alese and wild animals is not always easy .
he waited 22 days long and lived mostly in a tent in order to make at Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect picture of birds that live near the tourist arri@@ vals .

in many parts of India , women are avoiding the greatest care to speak the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women that they respect the husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences they should pay the norm to this practice .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned by a cabinet from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a and dis@@ owned by her family and the village community after having heard a married relatives with its name .
the tradition of their wives also do not name their wives , is also common among men . however , they have much less per@@ missions to fear , if any , they should not comply with this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ h in the district of Pun@@ e , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health professionals and house@@ wives , a unique club and were thus rapidly becoming the main chat@@ ty of the city .
it is a place just for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of the 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ ba@@ al campaign launched by the community Video Volun@@ te@@ ers and advocates the exploitation of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working with the help of its video camera with the help of its video camera to cover practice , such as children &apos;s marriage up to the exile of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected members , and guides these clubs .
it reports on how these clubs are created a safe place for these women and at the same time they made amb@@ ass@@ adors of change .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini was shown in their discussion , was the women who don &apos;t name their hus@@ bands .
she decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women can easily identify .
speaking out of the name of their hus@@ bands , a Br@@ ing , whom they have accepted all our du@@ ti@@ fully and never asked questions .
Roh@@ ini writes :
this tradition testi@@ fied that a woman wishes her husband and wishes him long life .
a woman who does not obey that is considered sne@@ ak@@ y , as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we never had thought of this discussion before .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who previously did not name her husband by the name of herself , wanted to try out at home how it works .
she showed the video of the discussions with her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband d@@ ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh for a long time after the video was over .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I ought to call him from now on in his name .
with this self confidence in luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first issue .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some felt that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the lap , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem of U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to tell the name of her husband with different emotions - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on .
then she asked all , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they may call us how they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ h in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in the married women speak the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that she ki@@ cked her whole practice just before her ; another decided to engage the whole of the frustration against him and his family by cur@@ sed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the ad@@ renaline rush on , with an ancest@@ ral br@@ ine , the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their hus@@ bands &apos; name .
and they stopped their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband &apos;s husband called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put in my head : his wife could not stop to say his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner before the entire family .
when her mother @-@ in mother she star@@ ing her , she got scar@@ ed and said that there was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant in France was less understanding , and the situation was in@@ experienced in violence .
Roh@@ ini reported how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing a cin@@ o@@ red spot on the forehead , which shows the E@@ at :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would bear the galvan@@ ising red point if he also does it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laughs only and I heard him to wear it .
the other women have not completely ceased , but they mean they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it in some days .
for many women the discussion sk@@ lu@@ b is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are doing a trip on each issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack up lunch and water and go out into the field .
I don &apos;t want the women to worry about who you could hear , &quot; she says .
in the last months they celebrated her own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in her life ; they danced and sang about things they had never done before .
Roh@@ ini says :
for so many years I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have talked about some things , for example our identities on our spouses are never so honest .
it feels great to say certain things out loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a panel discussion , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing .
some women have been in the group since their marriage only Sar@@ is .
for most it is okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ man @-@ Kur@@ ta a vast hem@@ or@@ d over a pants , they did not drink .
after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of his own clothes , morality , with the Sar@@ is and a lot more , s@@ mug@@ gling Roh@@ ini with its own pair of Cur@@ tas ( Ober@@ inhi@@ den ) in a panel discussion , so that women could carry them .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will succeed .
on the question , if in the five months since their first discussion had already changed a little , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things were slowly coming into roles :
we have only made small steps so far .
some women tried it a few times , but then I got back to say the name of their hus@@ ten .
some , including me , do it yet , but only if they are alone and are not members of other family members .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands . only one or two women now carry on their forehead at any time on their forehead .
the women in the disc@@ sion@@ sk@@ ate know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like listening to more freedom of movement or their own clothes @-@ choice - at the end of a hard navig@@ ating river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how raw ini explains :
each one of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am too .
but this club gives each of us confidence that will change something .
and I know that it &apos;s not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman enters the club home and reported other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

a new system of kidn@@ apping people for organ@@ es@@ men , presumably for believing purposes , is troubled by the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a series of operations in life to stop the Prak@@ tik .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ k , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and some of the organs have been harv@@ ested .
two men were arrested and separated in the episode that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are being used .
it gives the local super@@ sti@@ tions that could bring the head of a men &apos;s gold given to gold , explained the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher from Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia to the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks were registered in Mozambique .
another group which is the target of assass@@ ination for ob@@ scure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN introduced a mission in the South African country to examine these Prak@@ tik .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , particularly in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns for this super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudices .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who are planning to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique , G@@ ossi@@ ans , the Moz@@ am@@ bic@@ an police warned against the latest assass@@ ination of three men of eleven men due to their bodily parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ k , where the murder of assass@@ inations were arrested .
Hus@@ sa@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , Student and inhabitants of the City of In@@ ham@@ ans in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police have already left the case :
PR@@ M thinks that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the gl@@ ans of men .
the persecution and assass@@ ination of construc@@ tional individuals for the extraction and selling of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , for probably again unbelie@@ ving rituals , has taken into consideration the police of the Republic of Mozambique ( PR@@ M ) , which also suggests that a faith existed , according to which the victims would have dom@@ inion , the riches of the riches .
in recent days three men were murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Samantha shared the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger &apos;s arms Sn@@ ai@@ pp@@ a , who pointed out that the problem is part of the bigger social difficulty in which Mos@@ ambique is facing :
I would like to be ashamed of a country where the people would have ashamed to go on the streets dressed when the teachers would be ashamed to go sex against good notes , and others would not viol@@ ate their bread , a country where neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor cr@@ ah@@ le or gluten @-@ member for the unbelie@@ ving purpose or &quot; black magic &quot; would be hun@@ ted , which aim to reach car@@ ving wealth .
despite the seriousness of the phenomenon , some could not escape the occasion for flaw@@ less humour .
Zen@@ a@@ ï@@ da Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and avi@@ d Twitter users , twe@@ et@@ ate that both the boss of the district Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , Pedro Sap@@ ange , as well as the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , both are the following member :

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which probably was recently been done .
this story was originally released on 8 July 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version is published under a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the fall of the alleged Chinese dissi@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer was announced at the end of June that he has been delivered to hospital for liver cancer at the end of June .
in 2009 Li@@ u was condemned to 11 years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state of state ) after calling on the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifes@@ to that advoc@@ acy the democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the State Department of China has called Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal affair , and a speaker , he considered it &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
nevertheless , China still receives calls from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to enable or allow him a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out to the issue .
Hong Kong Free Press has compiled some reaction from abroad .
united nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met in late June Chinese officials to discuss the fall of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should exert pressure to permit Li@@ u abroad a treatment .
Norway in Norway
Norway &apos;s prime minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and foreign minister B@@ ør@@ ring Bren@@ da have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway was st@@ alled when the Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to Li@@ u for the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 , although the Norwegian government argue that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations have continued until the end of December last year . only in June Norway was signed an agreement to resume the salmon swe@@ eping to China , since exports had been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously suffering , the Nobel Commit@@ tees transferred his hope for a unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a vote in which China was asked to free Li@@ u and his wife to immediately rid of the house of house arrest and permit him to seek medical assistance , where he wants .
the peak of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us , as she said in an Declaration on June 30th :
at the same time , we expect China to see all the restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members .
they should meet and receive all the visits , they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
us ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared with that the Americans &quot; wish him that he has the opportunity to treat it , in that it may help him with his recovery . &quot;
a spokes@@ person in the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary , Pol@@ ley , announced the message of the Embassy AF@@ P on 27 June , that the message announced the Chinese authorities to free not only Li@@ u , but also free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the call of the US Embassy was an angry response from China to itself , with the exterior of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere with interven@@ ing and ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley informed that China should offer the couple :
protection and freedom such as travel opportunities and access to the medical care of his choice , which they entitled to a Chinese constitution and legal system , as well as international obligations .
the U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have just introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government towards it , Li@@ u and his wife to un@@ condition@@ ally release .
I urge China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o condition@@ ally so that he can move into a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Minister of Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the medical support he needed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping appeared on the 7th and 8th July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Re@@ uters that China had great concerns , whether the vor@@ tex could be o@@ vers@@ had@@ ows a visit to Hamburg .
Canada
on 28 June , the French ambassador John McC@@ all@@ um asked China to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to ensure care of his family .
Li@@ us attorney ( AF@@ P previously told that Li@@ us wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day but the police are always monitored the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
McC@@ all@@ um says furthermore :
Canada urges China to hold its international human rights obligations , including free expression of expression , and to release the imprisoned rights for the exercise of these rights .
France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry requested China to open for humanitarian reasons in a declaration on June 29 , issued for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o gets all the treatments he , regardless of where , is needed . furthermore , his wife and his family shall have contact with him .
although the news channel France info was already reported that the French government would welcome li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information out whether France will eventually record him .
Taiwan
the Council of the celebration in Taiwan requested China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and to show a greater tolerance of those who want peaceful means to promote political reforms and democratic development .
the ta@@ i@@ wan@@ ese law@@ makers Yu @-@ nu of the ruling Democratic Party ( EPP ) also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to treat themselves in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , reflected in a statement on June 28th to Li@@ u and gave us that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he was severely re@@ pressed , to a harmonious , stable and prosperous China , which in turn had contributed to a peaceful world .
I felt personally moved and encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected people , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and the rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question might seem fool@@ ish as Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice , I@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered as a city .
this observation has spar@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osph@@ ere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the former Chamber of Commerce Association of the State of New York , the Minister expressed that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , as compared to Singapore with other countries .
he ass@@ ures that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one has questioned whether new York is a democracy ...
this is where most people make a mistake .
I tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rot@@ ate the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrific@@ ed to create this valuable land , we can say that ultimately we are not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the semb@@ lance of fle@@ eing the responsibilities , a mandatory .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons were not very pos@@ able : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in the face of its , it inevitably appeared un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities which are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once one reaches the core point of the topic , the good old body re@@ appears from the author@@ itarian rulers to be the democrats , leave the tw@@ isted logic as it adap@@ ts better to their power .
in the end , the answers given during the last week of Shan@@ gh@@ amal@@ gam were given answers to his American guests in relation to our press , our Ju@@ dict@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers .
he had the appropriate question with non @-@ answers of the rational kind .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ gh@@ gam to make his mind clear , because that conclusion did not understand this conclusion .
personally I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , thus to which country belongs to our city ...
short , I understand nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be very grateful if our precious K Shan@@ gh@@ gam would take the effort to clarify this point if it was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by placing on the blog its comment , he tells about the reviews that one should begin to read the whole trans@@ cript of the conference to better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ gh@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the trans@@ cript
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore will be so un@@ equ@@ alled , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he placed Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of those cities saw a party in decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously not meant it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment at Shan@@ gh@@ gam , who as the leader of a growing generation , which makes a polem@@ ical statement .
I am talking about what the Minister of Justice in Singapore said , very embarrassed ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - do I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Shan@@ gh@@ gam , a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure whether he truly believes it is true and conscious of what he def@@ ends .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek review breaks the weaknesses of the forces of Shan@@ gri @-@ Argum@@ ents :
&quot; &quot; &quot; has Mr. Shan@@ gh@@ amal@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rejected a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a bon@@ ding teacher ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are regarded only as independent and sovereign state ?
if not , which country go back to the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it plays an important role within the cabinet of the cabinet , the statements of Mr Shan@@ gh@@ amal@@ gam will be of serious significance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
why do business leaders afford their military service , they only defend their city but not their country ?
whom do our Prime Minister have to pay bills ?
what is the value of our pink personnel rep@@ ell@@ ent ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
if the magazine Jour@@ ney of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and has always been a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this proposition seems to have anno@@ yed many parts of Singapur ...
nobody has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; etc . , &quot; but this is not quite true .
we should speak of the defence of the city rather .

their answers will be published here as part of a continuous series , with the rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world revealed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the newest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question I am most asked in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no , I am sorry . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan .
depending on which situation the conversation takes place , it is considered polite to show interest in its inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ or by asking personal questions .
on my clear position then follow the default ir@@ t : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans might cook in@@ wardly in anger , if they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t bother that .
for someone who does not know , there is little that differs us to Can@@ adi@@ ans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans make a Canadian flag well visible at their ru@@ cks@@ ack when they travel .
all dear Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans now ... .
it was also the case when I started travelling through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and 11 September .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried small A@@ hor@@ n@@ blades at their luggage to differ from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care !
we do not have weapons !
gender @-@ sex marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all appear to think , Canada is so great .
we are courteous .
we obviously say very often &quot; excuse . &quot;
Canada is supposedly regarded as the tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends , which I really admire .
it would not make a difference to me if one would change me , for example , using Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some issues with the post@@ mark . &quot;
first : what kind of being &quot; kind &quot; is basically to be mirror - as the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , yet tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) .
if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; no personality has .
there are no corners and edges , nothing that you can encounter .
being harmless , means in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and no attention to deserve .
this can be something good when you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen to pass .
I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and being alone , a main objective for Can@@ adi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders describe as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is perhaps just cool pol@@ it@@ eness . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence with neighbours .
we are missing the warm , open kindness , which I connect with my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Justin Tru@@ de@@ au joined the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our Prime Minister has made Canada even sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ ded Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand famous pop @-@ band has published a music video , which took the Jun@@ ta par@@ o@@ ded , which took power in 2014 and , despite their promise , restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Col@@ our describes a young man who tells him what rules his girlfriend makes .
although not explicitly politically , the music video refers directly to the continuing military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for song was an amazing success .
in the first three days , the video featured on Facebook up@@ loaded video 1.@@ 25@@ 4 and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ video &quot; Der Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists opened up the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai policy , especially as it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule .
check out these videos yet , which refer to some of the political issues that Thailand has continued to pursue in the last three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refer to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dra@@ ining &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; section 44 of the provisional constitution , which makes the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the host &apos;s absolute decision making on important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program for &quot; setup change &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are viewed by the jun@@ ta as critics .
the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ ague and im@@ clear regulations are often used by the authorities to be held for activ@@ ist and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army , monitors the online content and individuals , who were accused , the monarchy is forced to s@@ lander , pro@@ secuted .
Thailand is put on a face against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic cou@@ l@@ ul@@ ting ) .
the war is quite out on 20 May 2014 .
two days later , it came to a coup in the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continued to pursue is their decision to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video it &apos;s even shown how people are thrown into a black van attack before putting them into an interval camp , another problem .
some journalists are in prison because they have pur@@ posed to be &quot; confusion &quot; in society and on Internet users are threatened long arrest warran@@ t , they should be offen@@ ded the monarchy .
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song members of the band who im@@ it@@ ated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute to Pan@@ em , &quot; who was already used by Put@@ sch opponents during the protests of 2014 .

the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri G@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society reco@@ vers only very slowly in East @-@ Asia Minor , especially in the T@@ ku@@ da district .
it has now been over 20 years since the Georgian @-@ ab@@ as@@ hic war has officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still heavily visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern districts in T@@ ku@@ da al show striking images .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ sh@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ pho@@ bic area of Ab@@ k@@ asien .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , asia @-@ Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the area of the Soviet .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , we live for the largest part of the Russians and the rab@@ bits in the area .
such settlements are also called Ge@@ ister@@ asia in Ab@@ le @-@ Asia .
there are still more than 10,000 people in the pre @-@ war era , today there are only a few hundred people in these verses .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ da al .
since 2011 the total population of the District 16@@ ,000 people stood after it was barely increased over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s , called Chr@@ u@@ z@@ g@@ love kas , are symbo@@ lically on the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are dropped and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local older man .
he starts an interview and it likes it hard to finish this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is still un@@ ambiguous . &quot;
in front of the war the village was full of life .
there were church centers , schools and kinder@@ gartens , which ministered to all of the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ lown magnific@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union , have now left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
K@@ hr@@ ush@@ chev , which can still accommodate one or two families , one gets to the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; our Mother is forbidden to photograph us , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she just forbidden us , that is all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pered something to her girlfriend and suddenly they leave the destroyed buildings and van@@ ish .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ h@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the subs@@ istence lifestyle ( cultivation of scenic products for personal needs ) such as cattle breeding , bee@@ keeping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
the District management provides free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
about ten years ago , an older woman with the name Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ant G@@ alya worked as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Jed@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite their oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ k@@ asien to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will remain forever in Asia Minor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina would not want to take a financial support from her daughter and ins@@ ists that instead she supports her young grand@@ son .
Gal@@ inas monthly pensions are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she gives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aunt G@@ alya is telling her and other villagers trying to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 year old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when vacations are , we visit us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this constantly - everyone is concerned with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbor seems on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; calling T@@ ant G@@ alya her to her . &quot; she said we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini .
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s dialogue in Nat@@ asch@@ a has lived together with her husband and the five common children in their house for some time .
Nat@@ asch@@ a was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she reminds himself of the village in front of the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russian , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ asien broke simply away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; we recently purchased land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative de@@ capit@@ ols in Ab@@ k@@ asien ) .
we want to build a house there , but it will still take a while , &quot; explains it thoroughly .
Nat@@ asch@@ a for each child will receive about $ 9 children &apos;s money .
your husband works in the pipeline .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house , where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once was , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
it tells us at first it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time it lost its anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
actually , it has to do rather something with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
I remember each day as the city and the war once were . &quot;
when our conversation swe@@ eps to the end , a little boy is over us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball flies from the window and another boy hun@@ ted him .
he plays with the ball , which is then rolling up the hill .
a group of children now follow the ball .
while they walk , some of them throw stones on the accident buildings .
these ruins are a part of their childhood who care for uncertainty in their lives .
you do not know it any other way .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; is home to its long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the State of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Br@@ acking was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission .
on the path of migrants to cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is managed by a 5@@ 9@@ - year @-@ old Mexico , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink e@@ ye@@ wear and gold @-@ colored ear @-@ rings in te@@ ddy bears form .
it is called Con@@ cep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name of Mama Africa .
this nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ kaner and Hai@@ tian who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2.@@ 50 Dollar per night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with high @-@ st@@ ole walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants are coming here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , people come to the full bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you M@@ um Africa ? &quot;
at present it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept out on cardboard boxes .
you would like to refuse no one else .
she also helps them and brings them to hospital when they are sick , they buy them medication they can &apos;t pay , they mas@@ ses them with a bal@@ m the ti@@ ring from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently in a short time .
I asked him if m@@ ama Africa is a reasonable nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ e ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ acking .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women .
very loving .
it has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ano travels with his sister who hopes to come to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
you have lived in Brazil , however it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and move toward the north .
the family had heard of other im@@ it@@ ators of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well known name on the route , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that the Hai@@ tian and Afri@@ cans often travel the way together and that Afri@@ cans already speak on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez .
as many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before in Brazil and worked as a construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football club .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey to the United States .
he has been guest in M@@ um Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket by Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that their guests send their often text messages if they left to gr@@ ind her or to report to her about the course of her trip .
she explains that her Christian faith is the power of her work .
she does not know much about Africa , but her guests are taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but it is not the only spark of hope for migrants travelling through tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the town a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
in this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and its family have taken migrants in their little house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a poli@@ cem@@ an and has established that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he started helping them to get a decent price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night offered .
at the moment are 25 people there , mainly Hai@@ tian .
some sleep on blankets to the bottom , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking niche .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela states that he knows what the guests are doing through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I experienced what they experience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border to the desert and we have suffered .
there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he became a raid on his post office from the United States .
the majority of migrants who travel through tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other inhabitants will also open the doors of their houses to them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he has fled to people in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to get black@@ ma@@ iled by him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and had an unknown , a single trav@@ eller , offered him her roof .
a few months later the family lives still here and she is trying to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa is all back full of guests .
in the courses , travellers need to consult their phones .
a minibus is arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that their house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gically , because of those who have gone .
like a glorious grandmother , she &apos;s fed her album with a lot of photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair care who has made her a manifestation , some photos of her grand children and many travellers more , boy and Old .
they laugh so sad , while they pre@@ tends to me shortly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have gone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users at the rate checked .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minorities region in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the mobile users were instructed in the Tian@@ shan District of the City of Uru@@ m@@ qi , in which she points the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must obtain access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but we col@@ ò@@ n the authorities use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report on Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the Autonom@@ ous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because they had installed shortly after they had replaced the app , replaced news with a private We@@ chat group .
in the communication of the police , the app has to investigate the springs and distribution routes of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as below :
j@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is the block@@ ade por@@ no@@ graphi@@ cally web pages , from online fraud , Tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to control their own home network .
this app with filtering for min@@ ors is meant to help the children develop a healthy lifestyle .
this features an app with these functions can of course be used in many different ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remote control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; government or even h@@ acker can manipulate the home network of a person or to ste@@ al from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this introduction is in harmony with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while reports on digital cens@@ or@@ ship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often gri@@ mmer for those who live in remote , printed ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict @-@ areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ in@@ sensitive Internet sealing .
based on Twitter @-@ based media outlets &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( the &apos; Rec@@ over &apos; Rec@@ over &apos; , the cens@@ ored news in China published , showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen will then re @-@ audi@@ ted whether they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian are certain that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that the people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be de@@ tained up to 10 days .
this is a back @-@ back for technological development .
you have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of imprisonment by The rest of the world .
we are back in ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( all over the move &apos; , also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , out of which proceeds , that the software can lift the hall@@ mark of a Windows operating system and can get full access to your computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones are to be used in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang are possibly a response to the instructions of the city of Party to minimize the distribution of illegal contents .
all governmental organisations , authorities and associated facilities , including universities and research facilities are required to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security Office in operation of their computers and communications .
a current report by Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned this new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Uru@@ m@@ qi , with the directive to all the inhabitants and entrepreneurs until the 1st August , their &quot; personal ID maps , &quot; external drives , portable disk , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards are recorded at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; and destroy them . however , this action hurt the personal rights of Uru@@ m@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and provides pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible waste , including those who relate to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything scre@@ ams after death
a unique cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane reported his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world you see you and stell@@ ar that you are alone in a place where all that right has disappeared .
everything has gradually dissolved , and a truth reveals that clearly visible , both inside and outside .
one that makes all honour to their name .
one that has cast into a list of feelings and expressions that no metaph@@ ors allow .
but when you get back the reality and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scen@@ eries and the performer - turn out the characters into beings out of flesh and blood , and all scre@@ ams towards death .
all doubts solve themselves in smoke and you become aware of your very existence , even when the Earth spinning on the axis of the tie . you realize that you are caught here between the walls that your parents , and in front of them your grandparents , stone to have built stone .
they have taken me and my father three times , but that &apos;s not enough to make me &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the leader of the security service it formulated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he revealed his power over us by even destroying the simplest concepts we knew .
five teenagers were destroyed during a peaceful protests like wee@@ ds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough for the city to disman@@ tle the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ aming .
all the city district cov@@ eted , only my own not .
for the first time it was silent , rainy , at the wrong time , even though I had no high demands on a town that turned to the arteries with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down somewhat , after the power supply in the neighborhoods stopped functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke the still@@ ness by crying several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All &apos;@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house @-@ out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I listened to my voice by the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to take together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined us in a glorious picture that filled my expectations fully and fully fulfilled .
in such a moment you become aware that you use the spirit from the lamp , but it just doesn &apos;t care in the straight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; makes you ready , we meet in the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid down .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can take , nothing can give you your voice , after you gave it all the way up to the office of the security service out of the body .
I came there .
the colon@@ el ghetto was there with several of his men . my father was already there , as I now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear , how thou shou@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am when we are not close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his h@@ water @-@ filled eyes were on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really mour@@ n for me to look into the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old ; it was the fourth time that I stood before this building .
perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity ; perhaps at the revolution .
I was so safe to my job when I answered , &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I never stopped to look at your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me and yet I didn &apos;t regret any word from what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in an individual and his father equal to him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father equal to that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stri@@ fe of this triumph@@ ant proposition lies in me until today in the nose .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a psychological torture , which I was subjected to months .
I shou@@ ters the farm sh@@ outs .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
then again through the farm and into the second office , that leads through a walk to the individual cells .
I looked at all details exactly before I managed the space .
unlike any other time , they probably have allocated a larger cell .
I have to share with only one other de@@ tain@@ ees and sit down immediately without having to wait for their permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the civil servants left the cell and I attacked an old @-@ established communication method : to beat the fist against the wall .
I learned that my cell @-@ comra@@ de was a &quot; first @-@ mate . &quot;
after a long hesitation he finally answered me .
apparently , in none of the surrounding cells there was a respected man middle @-@ aged man who sees me similar and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the complete darkness , there are no markings facial extracts to me , and doctors are not there ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; perhaps somebody whose voice sounds similar to mine ? &quot;
all the answers are given in existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will be mis@@ heard right away .
the investig@@ ator had insured me , they would leave him if I abide .
li@@ ars .
like I would have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to exp@@ el all these cro@@ ws , which lab@@ s themselves in the fruits in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I still hear them &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ na Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there must be approximately 10 am in the evening ; always to kill the time the scre@@ ams , every day .
the door opens up .
I was always convinced that Black saw the colour of ruin , until I presented the yellow light : the Gre@@ ad ( about : &quot; thunder@@ ner , &quot; reference to the 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; they are here to be mis@@ heard . &quot;
thus the secret was lab@@ eled : to protect the state security ahead of us and to prevent that we im@@ mobil@@ ise the tra@@ itors and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - thus they played their con@@ fes@@ sions and smell the close view of their world view .
this is not a house , this is not a country ; it is a curse they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero .
I cared for the hear@@ ings and tre@@ mb@@ ling to Abu Ima@@ d , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me so before .
he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions , &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join these diary and to protest on demonstrations that will soon end up . &quot;
I did not answer .
I have used it to me , not to answer .
I can really no longer tell you when j@@ ang@@ lements and pun@@ ches became an ordinary communication for me to an ordinary communication instrument .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to it or used to be punished , although I had nothing done to make this punishment .
on penalty in all their variety .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls this lovingly @-@ con@@ fession . &quot;
it begins with a plastic tube , which probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ u@@ tion@@ er sti@@ fl@@ akes to your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him and you cannot rep@@ ay your cry .
my cry found him not enough , why they ex@@ ed the pipe with a cable inter@@ changeable .
during my first proc@@ ession , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had already worked as Müll@@ ner , or if this belonged to the normal work equipment .
they had four cables inter@@ woven for us to present us , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable .
within one hour three of them altern@@ ated three of them , while I was still in the row .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I listened to scre@@ am .
the exec@@ u@@ tion@@ er noticed the cooling and found no favor from it , which is why he was next to an electric up@@ loaded one .
flow perme@@ ating my entire body , enough to provide my whole quarter .
my half @-@ neck body , the stretch out on the floor was the perfect black@@ manager .
the bar@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible periods he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been about midnight .
I decided to lay myself asleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours left me like minutes before .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the light light meets the space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ise with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will answer with the voice of an exhaustive youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be fear@@ ful worries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be silent and away , you will be moved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they were always released .
where do they run me ? !
the j@@ ord@@ an R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b spends the most of his time inside ; sometimes he lo@@ dges to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , every now and again to his couch .
but what one can count on is a cigarette between its fingers or its with nicotine to discover lips .
he lives in the top @-@ floor of his family house that had been hearing them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel exercised His occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s family had forced itself to flee their village in Palestine , in which they had lived as fel@@ ic@@ ye@@ es ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who presents the conservative majority and questioned her old well @-@ proven opinions about gender roles , sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ hy .
with his music , who often deals with issues like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only found in his hometown Am@@ man Rel@@ ative , but also in cities that are ranging from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with its 25 years H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees itself as someone who is not limited by limits in his thinking , and according to his own statement with the people who suffer the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if it does not open it openly , it is a special a@@ version to the US American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war areas , something with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian refugees &quot; - so he describes himself even though he was born in Jordan , who has never been in Palestine .
&quot; I do not think about my own living circumstances so , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b .
then he adds : &quot; I think so because I am a man , &quot; while he poured into water sol@@ vent in two cups . it is the holy month of Ramad@@ an ; at this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset .
the Hungarian law also states that public consumption of food during Ramad@@ an is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has some weakness for it to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has to do with a scor@@ ching hot Jun@@ it@@ ag little with protest against Islam .
basically the s@@ war@@ ms speak a warm coffee and the wa@@ ist@@ ulas of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose first and foremost of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when looking at a view of neighboring countries .
it is therefore avoidable to do basic things - just as in the public during Ramad@@ an to drink water - in order not to land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Jord@@ ani@@ ens had a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already the second time .
some parliament@@ arians , who support the Islamic action of action - the national branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homo@@ sexual fron@@ ts@@ he@@ ets Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert .
the MEP and former spokes@@ person in the Islamic coalition D@@ IMA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; had just been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer .
many are also asser@@ ting that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous milit@@ ism that questioned the trusted legitimacy of author@@ itarian regimes in the whole region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la underlined the j@@ ord@@ an people as a &quot; progressive support of human rights , &quot; which will continue to stand for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement should probably not be simply sil@@ ken or rhet@@ oric , it is actually an ever more clearly cryst@@ alli@@ zed reality in Jordan reflect the work in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work .
in 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s traditional gender standards become a body by em@@ itting his vision of the fate of Arab women who have mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a clearly sc@@ ammed unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless men who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should trust .
in the past few years , Jordan has increased the number of &quot; Hon@@ orary mur@@ ders &quot; - the in@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch the number of Hon@@ orary mur@@ ders reached its peak in 2016 . however , it is still difficult that Jordan has been missing the institutional infrastructure to aid the women who tried to be victims of mur@@ ders or domestic violence .
according to a law on over@@ working fighting in 1954 , women may be exposed to the risk of inter@@ acting force , &quot; for in@@ definite period in prison , &quot; and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee from the family necessary that the woman will not happen .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ b music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known for it to shy away from issues that are long as tab@@ u in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but recognizes that he is his music , the full explicit references to sexuality , freedom and expression , not separate from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , Man .
I was interven@@ ed in politics , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is taking on the question of the Palestinian identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the focus is on poverty again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that is political at the core can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song called &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is there . &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get in his words &quot; what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ geneous or homo@@ sexuality .
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on the equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals have been strongly cens@@ ored up until in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b led an interview for the popular regulatory Online@@ programme Ro@@ ya , to later note that his comments were swe@@ pt out of the context and cens@@ ored by his opinion .
&quot; on Youtube , it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but it has only been working @-@ worked version , &quot; he says .
today H@@ da@@ i@@ b acqu@@ ires open to the Arab Republic of T@@ Q + Community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homo@@ sexu@@ als are not speaking of Islam .
he mentions Abu Nu@@ ts , a poet of the 8th century , which still has remained in mind thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ eva claimed to work later on behalf of the calibr@@ ation later , in the eighth century to write openly about homo@@ sexuality , why can Jord@@ anian parliament not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic kingdom there is nothing more new that the government is sanc@@ tioned by attacks on freedom of speech and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ i syndic@@ ate recorded several former governmental authorities and members of the teacher &apos;s association , with the reason they would have expressed criticism in social media critical about the problems that are deeply rooted in the country deeply rooted in the country .
according to this , the concert H@@ da@@ i@@ bs is according to the opinion that only the tip of the ice@@ berg - the actual challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ i ier .
for him , progress is a constant place for giving and taking . Jordan has subsequently for@@ ged the way for the second time in a row but the path of progress - this is H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , op@@ ting and inner changes . it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Muslim society .
finally H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , also of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
he did not only dreams of bringing his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but to experience &quot; it . &quot;
perhaps the region helps with music , art and literature from a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , streams and by artificial way of master@@ ing democracies . at least he hopes that .
until it has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue and therefore also resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these large , extravag@@ ant warri@@ ors are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories of origin of the Neb@@ uta festivals .
one assumed that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ cus . another theory indicates that the fort@@ resses , dru@@ mming and dancing over more than one thousand years have been handed over and from a time taken in the armies from the West Japan to the north @-@ east to force the indigenous people of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi to force the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could pick up some great seats , so we got a super view .
it is difficult to imagine how big these parts are ...
a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I looked at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars are just visible .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , will take the &apos; Neb@@ uta Festival the only true one - and an admir@@ able way to spend their summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival to me .
the sight of a 18 meter high car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely were external appearance and body @-@ care as important as in this story , because they help to maintain the Peruvian youth from crime and promote a legitimate job as the hair@@ dres@@ ser .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s major port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where road predat@@ ory and illegal drugs trading are daily .
a survey published in April 2017 , that 5@@ 1.5 per cent of the population of this region did not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the fallen hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Brazil ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to being more and more normal citizens in the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can form these elaborate hair@@ styles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme boundaries of imagination and creativity , even has inspired an annual event , competition of the hair@@ dres@@ ser &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who has been running since 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are experts participating in each other to show who can look for the most ex@@ centric looks like you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook @-@ profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions like the school August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy who is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to exchange young people , exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of receiving a training in hair@@ dressing art which allows them to find jobs .
motivated by this activity and the bi@@ dding possibilities demonstrated by dozens of young people that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion .
the school provided special training workshops as early as March 2006 and reported about some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only professional school in the church and the district , which we are very proud , because of love for the children we have built up this educational community .
Colombia : love notes to guer@@ rilla warfare
photo : Valentina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the revised version of the article &quot; love @-@ ships in guer@@ rilla warfare , &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love notes to people we know ?
is it not so much more important , people who have been able to spend with affection ?
precisely this question went by the two young Colom@@ bian activists , Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation Bogot@@ a and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation is no longer the head and inspired her to write to the campaign C@@ art@@ as por la Re@@ conci@@ li@@ ación ( letters for reconciliation ) that encourage young people to write letters .
recently , her land was a ro@@ gue of a historic event , and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ rilla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
internationally , the sig@@ nat@@ ories of the peace treaty was considered so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits .
but before the Colom@@ bian , there is still a long way to get there from a real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ rilla warfare , which had been used for many years in illi@@ cit production , had been exposed to a war rhet@@ or@@ ical rhet@@ oric and carried on arms around the clock , now have to re @-@ integrate itself into the life of a civilians .
the Colom@@ bian company again , which had become accustomed to living in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guer@@ rilla war , must now absorb into their ranks and support them in building a new life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Leonardo and Cr@@ istian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were convinced that the young colum@@ n@@ ist would have to close and help with the integration process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is exactly what they did : up to now thousands of young people have written letters - loves meetings at former guer@@ illa to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former guer@@ illa , which should then be handed over personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for letters to reconciliation was born on the world summit of the Nobel Peace Prize winner who took place in Bogotá in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to briefly speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ thi where the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to 2014 .
this stated that we love the people who love to write to Valentine &apos;s Day of love , but those forget that they need much more necessary .
he plan , he related to share his love with people this year , which needed the most urgent confirmation .
thus the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and establish a new life . &quot; letters will show that the Colom@@ bian company is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace . &quot;
so far more than 2000 letters were collected within the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colom@@ bian such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bogotá .
&apos;@@ i never thought that someone would forgive me &quot;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN @-@ camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o region on 19th March .
a group of 40 students of the university Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bogot@@ a re@@ isten to the camp to personally transfer letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC set themselves as they had done before to capture the prec@@ ep@@ ts of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very movable moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can go through within just a couple of hours - from fear to luck and everything in between , &quot; told the political scientist Manuela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a staff of the govern@@ ors of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience , such as :
after we had passed the letters , a former fighter carried me through the camp of the guer@@ illa fighters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I entered into one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( a sort of hut in which the guer@@ rilla war ) saw , I saw a guer@@ illa which wrote something . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was afraid to go down , because along with it on bed was a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Dorn@@ rö@@ schen@@ be@@ zz@@ f .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I said to him and asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter I wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hope@@ ful letter .
never in my life someone has written something so beautiful , that is why I answer it . suddenly , I suddenly walked the tears over the che@@ eks .
I hu@@ gged him quite tight and set me next to the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was sorry for the war , I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companions of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never wanted to join something else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC , the only way to save him and his six brothers from hunger . &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside , which wa@@ its for us with open arms .
until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reigns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
in pr@@ el@@ ude , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came to a discussion .
the students had grown up all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC already participated in the dark .
therefore the leaders of the F@@ ARC the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views about the peace process : &quot; for many years we have seen how social injustice by the state into the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to shaping the society in that country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a purpose of this scale , it is worth to overcome all the obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
to hear these people who have never heard heard before and had no electoral law and know that the people I &apos;ve seen often seen as a monster and even hate me , too were people with beautiful feelings which were turned through their circumstances and environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all men - including those who have killed and so much damage , can bring us something together and give a smile and a hug .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander at the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the colum@@ bi@@ an@@ ists was declared that after the dis@@ ar@@ ming peace would reign .
but that is not the case .
as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are prepared to stand up arms and protest for their rights . and this is also fully justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , to a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all def@@ ender of peace - regardless of race , religion or ideology - to rise above all who dream of a country in the war .
we give to you our word , make our contribution and bring victims , because we know from their own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence , will be ahead many difficulties .
there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them .

homo@@ sexu@@ als and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ ca@@ sian region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ex@@ tor@@ tion .
with horror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last few months on the persecution of sul@@ try men in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but the threat posed like a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ k about the settlement of the T@@ Q commune is not first written over night .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the republic .
the LGB@@ T@@ Q law in Che@@ chn@@ ya in Che@@ chn@@ ya have conquered the international headlines , after reports published reports , the dis@@ appearances , torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ ash@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gas@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , the suspi@@ cious que@@ er men feast and they were hidden in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a conc@@ ub@@ ine , was born in Gros@@ ny , and grew up there .
ever since her childhood she felt that she was in fact a woman .
when they were born , you became aware that Che@@ chn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Che@@ chn@@ ya had experienced from the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened to Sabrina .
they were frigh@@ tened of fear for their life to the end of the day .
Sabrina : I was a volunteer hel@@ pers in an human rights organisation .
one day it was told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from D@@ ag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ lady who was in trouble .
she did not have any money , so I did not hesitate to hesitate .
while I tried to help her , he was a friend of whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread her all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men more in Che@@ chn@@ ya to remove that shame ? &quot;
afterwards the photos of my documents made the lap of W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I was here to show a few shopping bag from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a man &apos;s voice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body but did nothing hurt .
then I heard another sentence , but this time in Che@@ chen : &quot; how long will you still want to dish@@ on@@ your family , you sc@@ and@@ stain ? &quot;
I knew the person not .
I just know , that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and woke up in the hospital again .
apparently some women had gotten everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called for an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I f@@ aded two key@@ points in my right lung @-@ wing .
OC Media : in what language p@@ oul@@ try were you placed - in the men or the women ?
Sabrina : my documents are outdated , there my male name is still standing , but the doctor understood and placed me to the women .
I am very grateful for this .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got to do it with the fear ; it was a Muslim , a cau@@ li@@ tic name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he has been respectful with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I got threats .
they called me , wrote to me - Rel@@ ated , stranger , some completely unknown .
this was the beginning of a nightmare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
the demanded to return to Che@@ chn@@ ya to prove that this was all a lie .
they presented absurd demands : some said to me I must prove it by being above without the streets ; others wanted me to have noticed in official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my gender that everything was bad , and Photoshop .
I have Kör@@ b@@ chen@@ size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still hard for her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some older men once spoke my mother on the street . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has not only ashamed your family , but the whole of the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother was too much and she placed himself a stri@@ ck around the neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved her .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , the window stood up a car with dark window wash@@ ers and a numer@@ ical sign with a 95 roof .
once it happened for the third time , I realized that there was a little lazy .
my human right friends over@@ beat the numer@@ ical depic@@ tions - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how are you fled ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to reveal their names but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something terrible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before leaving Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I had arrived .
I bought it without having to register without any identification , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and cast them in the rub@@ b@@ ish .
came out and checked in the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card in my mobile phone .
in the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think about , you are confident , just because you left the country ?
our people already know what hotel you want . they even know your number .
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine it ? !
this was indeed my number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and sisters .
however , we do not talk about the sex balance , that is a tab@@ lo@@ topic .
some traditionally Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements are still wearing me .
as much as I wish , this spiritual barrier cannot be overcome .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we chat@@ ting with camera , I actually give me effort to look at the person they remember from their past - that is , in my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those that have stayed with the dor@@ sal ?
Sabrina : I submitted a report to Washington last week .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
I spoke to someone who has saved the one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during the Ramad@@ an , he had no man arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ramad@@ an could hardly wait and he didn &apos;t lock a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that I , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the issue with the person concerned and at the end request that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by blood satisfaction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : are there still some gay men in these secrecy ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine says there was not so many .
if , then especially those who have no rich relatives or have been dropped by their relatives to face Kad@@ y@@ rows Court .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can present them later than terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they be killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim them , they could have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but specifically sub@@ merged to radic@@ alize themselves .
OC Media : is this just a pres@@ ump@@ tion or do you have a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I just quote someone who was de@@ tained in the one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people in this prison were gone , after their beard grows .
there has since been nothing new from them .
they have just taken them with them .
and this so @-@ called Lord , that person was with him when these people were taken .
up to now , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports yet . we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why otherwise would it not have allowed this person to shave ?
do you know if these per@@ secu@@ tions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation already occurred in the past ?
Sabrina : I always carried my hair long .
in Che@@ chn@@ ya , I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 , I was already very well known when I lived there - and I never had any problems .
in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 when the sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Russia originally wanted to lead us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civili@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but ultimately has thrown back to the st@@ one@@ age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my eyeb@@ rows were hat@@ ched ; I had colored eyelashes , wearing ro@@ cking je@@ ans and a short t@@ ops .
the safety of the Sh@@ aria has never h@@ mm@@ ed me only a hair .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , a whole group of people like me met .
it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people met there .
we have never been offen@@ ded .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a speech : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Sp@@ otte not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
you often say it to children , if people make themselves fun over the sick .
OC Media : so they just got their eyes closed to you , because they believed you were sick ?
Sabrina : yeah .
they never offen@@ ded me , never hun@@ ted and never struck .
OC Media : how long did this worship stay last ?
Sabrina : so long before Kad@@ y@@ row came on the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak on TV about morality .
he was not talking about us , but rather about the behavior of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how the people in the city started to change .
he who was in the f@@ aint and laugh@@ ed on the ground , viewed you on a one hand with suspicion .
in the time I left Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but every time I got back home , I could sense how the situation in the Republic was constantly worse .
OC Media : what activity are you now going ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t con@@ den@@ sed a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
aside from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
I am currently responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of Psych@@ ologist .
we organise teac@@ re@@ ffs , gathering , I join them to hospital and help them to get cri@@ es .
I do not have a p@@ enny for it .
I have discovered these people themselves , when I sli@@ pped shelter .
I am Muslim and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : are you looking for a trip ?
Sabrina : this is ni@@ ch@@ ew .
so nature is pure and nothing has to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to proph@@ esy with foam in front of the mouth , that there are no co@@ ils at them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the D@@ ag@@ est@@ ans have what the Cabal have , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet there are they - but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in Che@@ chn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear .
here I meet so many men from the Caucasus .
many of them - practicing Muslims , who go to the mosque and fa@@ sten during the Ramad@@ an - live with men together .
you know many think in Transi@@ tive identity to men who love men and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of sensation to be exact , different ways of living .
it is most important for me to feel myself in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry , I &apos;m going to be back in person here , but my last intimate relationship is already more than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all because - I just know I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase in su@@ ici@@ des within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ ma@@ az@@ i community in Iran
Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty @-@ rate among the native Arab population .
there has been a strong rise in su@@ ici@@ des for the past few months .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ Amaz@@ i on August 27 back the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab im@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had one child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he ashamed of his own helpl@@ essness that can count the in@@ capacity for his family , such as Ah@@ ma@@ az@@ i rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video clip was held on YouTube after he had ign@@ ited for himself .
some people managed to clear the flames again , and Mor@@ ac@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the de@@ fl@@ ations were so strong that doctors could no longer do anything .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only su@@ icide , which occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ ma@@ az@@ i minority , and campa@@ ig@@ ners to warn of that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ ma@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights revealed this month a few others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ wn Ban@@ i Tam@@ im .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family @-@ athers , who felt helpl@@ ess and impot@@ ent due to the persecution by the Iranian government , helpl@@ ess and impot@@ ent to feed their families and follow a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ ma@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , in which a large part of Iran lived in Iran , was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the local Arab population to establish their livel@@ ih@@ oods .
in a century ago the Arabic ancest@@ ry was an influential region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy took power over and 1925 huge efforts began to end the ethnic autonomy in Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most traditional and most valuable areas of farming .
despite this valuable resource , the regional economy is continuing to develop slowly , and the native population gets only little of that wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated disease , famine and priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime denied the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arabs systematic jobs in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s , the waters of the Arab areas into the Persian areas , where the provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are located .
these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation in the region caused by dr@@ y@@ ness and devast@@ ate local farmers and fish and palm trees industries .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi youth now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Muhammad P@@ ur , the Iranian Director @-@ General for co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , applied that 5 % of the Ah@@ ma@@ az@@ is who have completed a job , completed 55 % a further school and have 45 % university degrees .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian , ancest@@ ral human rights activ@@ ist with resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices , that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment , and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; resulted in a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of su@@ ici@@ des among young Ah@@ ma@@ az@@ i men .
Do@@ him@@ i said that especially unemployment has grown worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ wa@@ z &apos;s new eth@@ ni@@ es and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the employment process :
since Func@@ tion@@ aries and institutions are not preferred by Arab labor force , the local Arab Ah@@ ma@@ az@@ i of access to job opportunities are ent@@ ailed in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national Resistance of young Arabs and force them to earn their living outside of their homeland .
there are people who had to change their ancest@@ or and surname to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i and be so attached , as even the Arabic name at the workplace will not be tolerated , let the speech of Arabic language or wearing arab@@ ic clothes .
given the circumstances , which must endure the Arab im@@ w@@ az@@ i , human rights defen@@ ders alarm , before the situation is explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for su@@ icide is un@@ important depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ icide is avoidable .

&quot; why I do not identify with femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ sec@@ tional dis@@ sec@@ tional &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons License .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion which was written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was the article of several discussions in which many different positions have been expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women who describe themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with frustration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be the feminist and why we generally all femin@@ ist * should be inside .
for example , that women today still earn less money in spite of equal education than men .
that women are still under strict observ@@ ance when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women come in early or later in various areas of life to a smoo@@ ther blan@@ ket and that discrimination are still flowing through the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I am at double and thre@@ e@@ fold .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I come to talk on skin colour , on racism , on black CIS , on black women in the LGB@@ T@@ Q commune or on black women from the Diaspora , when I talk of what type we &apos;ve been physically , mentally and verbal , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists are to be silent .
but nevertheless all agreed that women - all women - should come together to lift their voices and to sing &apos; Kum@@ b@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing the equality ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk about that there is in addition to sexu@@ alised violence an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence that we are exposed to black women at two times .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and proven@@ ance are less money than white men and women .
that black girl and girls often referred to school with a mig@@ rational background than white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women .
on the one hand , I want that all women , all men and all human beings have neither skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot connect myself as black lady , into whose centre the white woman stands ref@@ uses to relate to inj@@ us@@ tices contained in her thinking , which relates both to the gender and to the skin colour of a person .
I &apos;m exhausted and will no longer fight for my membership in a white @-@ fem@@ ini@@ zed spheres , who always rejected me and countless other black women and again and again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ jour@@ ner mour@@ ned in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I don &apos;t want to maintain a ideology inten@@ ding an ideology in which the black lady is a dramatic and margin@@ alized Being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to re@@ join me , which also absorb through cultural in@@ clin@@ ations of our customs and customs , to advance their ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer seek to give white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping of skin color and gender . for some of them continue to mention the importance of black women for feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them a better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women different kinds of homes and pin@@ point out of white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism is still in his name .
I prefer to release me fully and totally of femin@@ ism and join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism that is being called to live for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of engaging me for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so persistent that interven@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
it is more important than ever before us to define black women according to our own ideas and engage us into the spheres , which are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ em , the author of the book Afri@@ cana U@@ AE : rec@@ laim@@ ing ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we can defend ourselves ) , that we can defend ourselves by creating our own forms and in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered , which make the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists are instantly call separ@@ atism and exclusion after they have read these lines , I ask you to inform yourself of the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of feminist movement from which the black woman is concerned .
in a blur@@ ry environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures because in this paradigm I exist .
I am recognized because of my dark skin and on the basis of my existence as a woman , as part of this paradigm .
I , a black woman , can b@@ lossom in an environment where my life is not over , nor ignored , still rejected .
p@@ ad@@ ling to pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this contribution from Todd Re@@ ub@@ old was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on international efforts to solve environmental issues .
in the framework of a content @-@ sharing agreement , this article is again published here .
over and over again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled to the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in the can@@ oe - with a special concern going through the Kurdistan region . his mission is aimed at making people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship to the rivers of the region and the effects of pollution on his church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dust , pollution and the un@@ controlled development , lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the Non @-@ Govern@@ ors Water@@ falls Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ ten@@ ders , who works and works to protect rivers , pa@@ stry and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the video Mus@@ a takes the urgency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we had no more water , how would we survive ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this video was produced , filmed for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq , and multi@@ medi@@ al journalist , filmed , filmed and published .
the focus of her work lies on persecuted , little note sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of co@@ oper@@ ative vide@@ ography and new multi@@ medi@@ al techniques , with their help of oppressed communities who can tell their stories in their way .
Paraguay women and her difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s murder in the country and in the region and to show their ref@@ usal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo from Jes@@ sie I@@ fr@@ an Pé@@ rez . use with kind permission .
the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by Cur@@ rent@@ ers . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # refused ) which covers about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most of the names were changed to the protection of the persons concerned .
a police attack said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their ex@@ partners who had become violent over against Viol@@ ence .
since the end of her relationship a little time passed and the police said , her statement would be put to the acts , but more could not do .
as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena on the mist@@ re@@ ation showed , also the ak@@ ten@@ ant display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez does not show anything .
a few days later the second woman returned to her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
when women ask at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases the women are also financially dependent on the men who are mist@@ re@@ ated . this explains why only 20 % of all women who admit victims to be victims of violence , log in at all with law enforcement authorities .
inhal@@ ation 1 thu@@ gs and statisti@@ c 2 im@@ mortality and a legal system that nothing under@@ mm@@ ed 3 Paraguay laws : good approach , defici@@ ent implementation r@@ ack@@ ge and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women really are mist@@ re@@ ed , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues in the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different indications and reports , but not even approaches how to demonstrate the level of gender violence against women in Paraguay .
but the available figures are however alar@@ ming .
in 2015 at the In@@ cre@@ wing Office , 9@@ 600 indicators were directed to domestic violence . at 70 % of them , it went on violence against women .
86 % of the people in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence during the peace treaties . also , 86 % of the indicators came to show .
in the adver@@ ts , 40 % of women said that they were physically mist@@ re@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic mis@@ tics .
these statistics reveal not the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an &apos;s Minister of Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes will actually be shown . &quot; on each woman , which in Paraguay because of psychological abuse will be re@@ funded , 9 women who do not do this .
on any woman who would be re@@ funded due to physical abuse , two women , who do not , &quot; stated it at the end of 2014 .
as women &apos;s su@@ icide in Paraguay is not an own criminal off@@ ence , the law enforcement agencies can not document properly just how many women are murdered by their current or former partners each year .
until August 2016 , journalists have at least 12 cases of women &apos;s icide in the country .
the Co@@ ordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay takes every ten days a woman due to violence by men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a sign with the ins@@ cription : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without intermedi@@ aries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no imp@@ unity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo by Jesus they in@@ sti@@ an Pé@@ rez . use with friendly permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
invisible Mis@@ si@@ ations and a legal system that doesn &apos;t take anything
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was a firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she called him the name of all her former friends .
at first she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then still there was . this was supposed to regret it forever .
today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old , and no longer with Carlos . but two years ago she endu@@ red the psychological violence , one of the most common forms of violence against women , and at the same time the most difficult recognizable :
I never thought I would be victims of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women happen to be sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are decei@@ ved by violent men .
I was convinced that I would never ever happen .
Mari@@ ana useless social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote posts on fac@@ ebook , in which they described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two years relationship described and told how he had isolated them .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever had raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they had won this so long by Carlos and did not leave him before .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least have had to blame for their crimes .
Victoria San@@ tos , which is not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner suspi@@ cious them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ o te CRE@@ O ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) that is made of women all in some way victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ ic abuse .
her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner even managed to persu@@ ade her to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as advertisements in the authorities remained without a result and also by their relatives , they received no support .
it led a process against their former partners who developed into an in@@ consistent legal struggle between Paraguay and their homeland , where it was mainly about money , power and influence of its former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , faul@@ ty implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws , which are very good , but not being applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the indication of abuse is a path full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen U@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for women in Paraguay , also provides great problems with the application of laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Parliament a bill that was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # Für@@ th ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and motion # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original bill of the law fores@@ ee@@ able to explain Fem@@ izi@@ d into an independent criminal off@@ ence and to pun@@ ish tougher on how it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
so the legis@@ lature has changed in some points in order to also win MEPs to the Law , and they feared that the path for de@@ crimin@@ alisation may be paved , which is currently banned in Paraguay and punished for up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill introduced , most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) charges , which have to present the victims of violence at the present time , if they just want to report and obtain a secure accommodation , to impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ing that the law is not effective , if the legisl@@ ator does not provide sufficient financial resources for this purpose :
in Paraguay , mist@@ re@@ ation is seen as part of inter@@ personal relations .
here , a re@@ think must take place so that violence is no longer viewed as something Nor@@ mal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who in the face of these facts makes a guilty ple@@ aded and carries to bear the offen@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; offen@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to report as long as to abuse , until failure is no longer regarded as normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Senate . previously , parts of the law were however changed . among other things , a passage was painted , which caused the partners in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation .
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for aggres@@ sor , to attack his victim again .
the del@@ eting of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is considered a great deal of return .
this article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by Cur@@ rent@@ ers . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # refused ) which covers about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most of the names were changed to the protection of the persons concerned .
independent Media in Oman a year after the ban on a newspaper continues to be attacked
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was locked up because of a fun of the information Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is locked on the home page of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; forbidden &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the An@@ sat@@ anic authorities have closed an independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n on account of her coverage about corruption in the sult@@ an .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he ab@@ uses a one @-@ year sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ al Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and brought to trial , but later come again free .
Oman being governed since 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had put his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a State coup .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the main offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defense Minister , Supreme Commander of Defence Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the domination of the sult@@ an is marked by the per@@ sever@@ ance efforts of security forces , especially the domestic military service , including press freedom , limiting and human rights defen@@ ders , independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers and other activists .
the authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and depri@@ ve citizens , also activists , share their views on public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closure and the imprisonment three of their editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , in which since its inception in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , issued an article entitled &quot; high @-@ level parties &quot; in the press on 26 July 2016 . in this it came to corruption in the judiciary and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to abol@@ ish a judgment in an inheritance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Edition of the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper on 26 July 2016 , with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ level parties &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ al Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , Member of the Committee of the Board , was taken from the ISS before the special department and was arrested by the security guards upon his arrival .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS launched the deputy chief editor at You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had been acting as chief editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the paper was concluded in an in@@ definite period after the Minister of Ministers had given the statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first hearing was held in the trial against al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i .
the Court condemned the three journalists to prison guards and also arranged the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were condemned among other things because of a distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the state of state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a public ban and s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year imprisonment and money loans amoun@@ ting to 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover , a one @-@ year professional ban against both journalists has been imposed .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to one year in prison and a sentence of 1000 judges ( 2@@ 600 US dollars ) after using &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i there was a b@@ ail of 5,000 US dollars ( 13 000 dollars ) and was released before judgment in prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appe@@ als Court said Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j caused a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ un@@ ari for six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after the completion of his six @-@ month sentence of prison in mas@@ on . Al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he ab@@ uses his one @-@ year sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also emphasized the decision of the Ministry of Information on the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper sees itself as opposed to attacks by the Iranian government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information received a statement by which the termination of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; had been extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Education was personally signed a further instruction , in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and thus acqu@@ itted the Minister for the decision of the Appe@@ al &apos;s decision to meet the publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which , in Oman in recent times the press freedom has been violated .
for additional injury , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ s@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to susp@@ end their operation .
due to the permanent closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of Mr. Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not prepared to end the extensive injury of the press freedom .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Chinese authorities to :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally free ;
2. to create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper so that their journalists can go to their work .
3 . to protect the press freedom in the country and
4 . under any circumstances ensure that human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their right human rights work and without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including judicial ver@@ can@@ als .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organisation , the human rights defen@@ ders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting freedom of expression and association and the right to gather peacefully , supported and provide protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understandings
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or 2016 in Zambia , showing the agreement with its consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing area , addressed by one of the most pressing challenges of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need on @-@ site medical research . there are two reasons : for a lack of healthcare professionals , many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and malaria have wide grave consequences in the poorest countries as elsewhere , and missing investments for research on these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem .
second , research , which is conducted by African scientists , with the creation of own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to economic growth in the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or is Director of centr@@ al@@ ab@@ ors at the Centre for Research of Infectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , especially as the AIDS @-@ epidemic initial serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for studying in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he scrut@@ ini@@ zed himself on HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the Sá@@ mi health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ or discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understandings of the media on this research .
( disclaimer : Dr. Warri@@ or speaks as an individual ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or RW : at the moment the focus of my work is based on research results . I support the sam@@ bian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
furthermore , I just started a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostics tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GV : what do you think is the important current science topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always remain receiver rather than to be creators himself &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the solutions we get are often not well applicable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GV : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are all different .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or here , because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GV : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research , you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GV : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GV : how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have great students of all ages .
there is a need for specific scientific training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of outer space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GV : can you describe us the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa to Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often , it is the limited speed , things to do and the start@@ ling access to scientific expertise that represent challenges here .
the system that magazines are accessible only against payment ( the so called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change worldwide food production
this entry by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine about solution opportunities for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton &apos;s breeding had been in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ th , the first plant , which has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronom@@ ers in the space .
almost 20 years ago , Mor@@ tons &apos;s work was achieved only by its own resour@@ ce@@ fulness and the question of how many sal@@ ads can get there .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s he noticed that more sal@@ ads were patented and that he therefore could not use them for breeding .
the patent stands not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance , diseases , a special red or green tone , or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
over the past few years more and more of such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or Kart@@ ing varieties . because of these trends , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and expert for food security are the future of food production .
as a passion@@ ately representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of tradition , Mor@@ ton still preser@@ ves the salad , he doesn &apos;t need for it anymore since his work is getting more and more difficult due to more limitations .
&quot; it &apos;s like to lie in a river a rock that I have to p@@ addle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus we need to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents go far too far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stick to judgment , no one can breed any more new species of salt because all the features are patented . so he is doing so good as possible and tried to cultivate those characteristics he would like .
however , he is very careful and tries to use no material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is becoming ever increasing in the U.S. and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; breeding ) .
Astron@@ au@@ ts from the International Space station ISS have cultivated red Rö@@ mer@@ al@@ at the variety out@@ red@@ ny in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station and eaten . there will be tested whether plants can be cultivated in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement out of the IT field , and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to protected software .
it was called into life to ensure that some plant species and -@@ gens are not protected as intellectual property and can be used permanently for plant breeders .
as part of the initiative , called Os@@ si , U.S. breeders can commit themselves to being able to use the seeds to use seeds from them .
however , this does not mean that they are not continuing to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders allow for others who do seeds to breed , to breed through their own varieties , and not immediately des@@ crip@@ tive - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
dark prospects
for em@@ powering Professor at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si @-@ board member , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over the seed and the possibility to breed new plants , both important for food security and for environmental protection .
seeds can therefore play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not occupied with genetically modified crops .
all kinds of plants might be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from organic farming or Monsanto and Bayer , who want to buy good food and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables , which is offered for example on farmers market , should also know that the way in which the vegetables are cultivated .
Nutri@@ tion@@ ists without seed sovereignty is not possible .
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ple@@ dge to provide other seeds for their seeds to be freely available to others . in contrast , their procedures are to patent in contrast to patent @-@ fine and plant @-@ characteristics .

Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered since the available genuine pool is due to the ever @-@ wide intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always more restric@@ tive , ceas@@ elessly shr@@ inking .
Claire Lu@@ by , executive director of the Os@@ si , has engaged in their doctoral work with a genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found that about a third of all cardboard @-@ characteristics are protected as intellectual property , ensuring that it is not difficult or usable for plant breeders .
for other plants , there are not such estimates yet , but experts like Lu@@ by suspect that saturated plants such as wheat are patented in an even larger style than salad or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are cultivated so that they have targeted features - from those , through which their taste or colour improves to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and increase threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders due to more and more patents decreases . genetic variety is now more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse than ever prior to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail Monsanto @-@ Spe@@ ak in C@@ arly Sc@@ adu@@ to indicate that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ key activities . with a total of four major banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to maintaining a genetic variety .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradic@@ ts that intellectual property reserves other breeders , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant @-@ varied innovations promote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can observe once the patent exp@@ ires . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method of the same result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes it by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees the other : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not provide any innovation .
and if you need to wait for so long to breed on plants that are adapted to the changed environment conditions , one would have already lost the struggle .
the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a general public and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ ary incentives have not appealing for us .
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us , and it will make us impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
altogether , Mor@@ ton goes to the concept to patent , which means that the characteristics would not really create itself .
the plants do they form themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol land@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US @-@ state Oregon and Os@@ si @-@ board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who breed a variety also covers its own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with big farms and mono@@ cultures , for their cultivation of mass@@ aging Her@@ bi@@ cides , are breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contrary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( those who are on international markets , but less than Monsanto are ) patents , you manage to survive most small seed companies , even without patents - either they reject it , or they keep it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile , or both are the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for in his grow@@ th@@ garten sal@@ ads .

Mor@@ ton , moreover , the opinion that breeders through the A@@ void of plant @-@ patented products would be innovative : &quot; it looks as if I had to produce something new with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than corporations .
I need constantly new material for my catalog , as I know my competitors are selling my varieties within a couple of years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , you &apos;re protected against competition for 20 years , so that in my opinion make it very nice . &quot;
although the USA seem to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , but the concept has spread rapidly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources , an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed program works the center with farmers and helps them to grow new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seed , and sell their own .
the German organisation S@@ co@@ l works on an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si obligations for breeders in the European Union .
( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , why the Os@@ si obligation cannot simply become one one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive powers of the European Union , the European Commission , declares that conventional bred plants would not be pat@@ able . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European patent am@@ ts which patents are cultivated on conventional bred plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is not a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed companies in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed companies and seed companies from all East Africa , to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend for pat@@ enting seed companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states that the organization is currently building an international alliance for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the planned next year the official start @-@ off will fall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a federation of environmental protection and development groups ( among them Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development organization US@@ C Canada and the Action group to ero@@ sion , technology and concentration - Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to seeds and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a plant well map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a network of aid agencies such as the W@@ K K@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - published a report . it represents that farmers will have the opportunity to contribute to seeds , exchange and improve plant breeding ; to ensure a stable supply of food can be ensured .
in the report also stresses the importance of a multi@@ faceted , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context , by the Lu@@ by of Os@@ si , that soon more people will recognize him .
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has great attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role in this way &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make the people clear that even more behind their food is . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ukrainian Wikipedia has chosen the 11 best photographers in the national part of the international photo competition &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ ki Lo@@ ves Earth &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; with the focus of natural monuments and reserves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the award ceremony took place on 7 October 2017 in the Museum of Natural Sciences in Kiev , where the winners were presented in an exhibition .
the Ukrainian part of the international competition was awarded in May of 3@@ 56 participants over 15,000 photos with more than 1,@@ 8@@ 60 motives on the topic of nature .
about one thousand of these images are already published in Wikipedia articles , which are published in different languages .

all winners received certificates as a memory and other prices like souvenirs with the competition logo or vou@@ chers for online shops .
the origin@@ ators of the 11 photos with the highest lawyers as well as competitors , who photographed most of the objects and were able to score the most points in the total score , were honoured with the prices .
additional awards were awarded by other organizations who joined the competition .
for example , the employees of the Natural Park Holo@@ si@@ i@@ v@@ sky@@ i , who is located in the metropolitan region , is the three best photos taken in said Park and submitted to the competition .
in addition , there were also some special categories in the national competition : &quot; Un@@ es@@ Discovery &quot; to the destruction of natural habitats , initiated by NGOs from the environmental sector , an overview of the subjects , in the photos on Wikipedia , best wildlife @-@ photos and best Kiev @-@ photo

Wikipe@@ di@@ ans from around 36 countries participated in the &quot; Wi@@ ki Lo@@ ves Earth &quot; Photo@@ contest .
the best photos of natural monuments ( like conservation areas , landscap@@ ing areas , national parks and qu@@ aint landscap@@ ing areas ) , can be seen in a common gallery at Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Commons .
organizers and other contributors have used the h@@ ash@@ tag # Wi@@ ki@@ Lov@@ es@@ Earth to publish photos and to advance the willingness of joint venture .
they have therefore been a total of more than 13@@ ,000 photos .

human rights organization and blog are the latest goals in the cens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still only locks Egyptian authorities on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend around 5 August , the Egyptian government began the website of the Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world , and reported beyond words .
August , the network published an opinion on Facebook where it critici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step , and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region .
to defend the Network for Human Rights Information - in spite of this attack and understanding of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities , who are supposed to defend their goal in this part of the world , so it was never been so difficult as it is now . FE@@ HR@@ I confirms that all technical possibilities were fully exploited to overcome the block@@ age and not to give up . we insist that our task will continue to fulfil .
AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first cens@@ ored site of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked more than two months 21 web pages , such as the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar emerging network of Al Jazeera because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , there is also no access to the blog of the Colom@@ bian and Human Rights scientist Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada supports his blog for the spread of Colom@@ bians and articles , which he writes for in Egypt , accessible web sites and media .
now the blog , which he was directed to byp@@ ass the cens@@ ors of the Egyptian government , even the target of an attack .
blo@@ g@@ gers , who is a provider of Canada , also located in Canada , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity since he was arrested by Egyptian armed forces during December 2013 and recorded a video on how the police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada on the blocking of the government and reflected what this means for him :
the blogs of blogs are very old , however , has a priority in the era of Ab@@ del fat@@ ally al@@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is nonetheless for two reasons for me :
1 ) It is managed to give me the feeling of a sie@@ ge for me ; a arrest , a attempted murder , sub@@ sum@@ ing at the national Security Council , the blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I wrote not in vain . in other words , my words have an influence , if only on a small audience .
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to the post of articles to circum@@ vent the cens@@ or@@ ship .
however , after being locked and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the mu@@ gs walk the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Thou@@ ght and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) imprisoned Egyptian authorities from May 24 to 06 . August 133 websites . these include technical tests in the networks of different internet service providers ( ISP ) , e.g. orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the block of suppliers via byp@@ assing by inter@@ nets and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12th we noticed how the block@@ age of web sites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s started .
such a practice indicates the intention of the government to block content and filter , to have access to the Egyptian users .
the situation in addition makes it worse that the cens@@ ors are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis , using which they can proceed to trial against such actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day by day newspapers in the whole of Brazil with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous post@@ cards .
some of the headlines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old school shot &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Je@@ wel@@ ve is murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die@@ be ro@@ b pharmacy with military arms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tim@@ er sends to 8@@ 500 soldiers of the Army , Marine and Air Force to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation , the force of force in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian government , Global Justice , even called the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these are now daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; at least find the manager of a local paper .
for detailed reporting of violence in the Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 the editorial &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in any major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ bery , sex crimes , etc . everything , but what happens from the civil@@ ised standard and what only in Rio is published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists don &apos;t close our eyes off their cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ ach , the editor of the newspaper , that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war of war in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war .
in the same video a journalist of the newspaper , that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas are given that are controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial the newspaper writes :
we are aware that a war course , if it is distor@@ ted , can also be used , atrocities of the police , who only upset and then ask questions to cover .
but we defend the war based on information and the struggle against corruption in the police , whose objective is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners .
did the name &quot; war &quot; more than they benefit ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasi@@ l is argu@@ ing the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ vei@@ ra against the violence as &quot; war . &quot; this is because of their opinion a justification of the security policy by the media and could make it more difficult to account for authority in the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - like extra in the analysis of the military deplo@@ y@@ ments in Rio itself - in combination with adequate investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ suffici@@ ency of public service .
to remember : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital .

Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; is false according to Cec@@ í@@ lia : &quot; 22 of the 30 @-@ violent cities in Brazil lies according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . this is the most up @-@ to @-@ date data .
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
if we look at the M@@ ord@@ ata per federal state , Rio has No. 16 , &quot; writes it .
extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company of South America , which stresses , as in Cec@@ í@@ lia , has repeatedly said the security policy of the state .
in addition to these security policy measures also the foundation of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a set of police set up by the federal state Rio in 2003 , whose objective is to use a massive police force on Fav@@ ela and to stay a unit permanently .
in the beginning , this actually resulted in a reduction of violent deaths . since some years , the U@@ PP however , for several reports on reg@@ isters and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly established police unit , increasingly under attack .
on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux is one of his articles in the year 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio has not set the criteria set out for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war is also causing serious consequences for human beings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this calls upon the state to use resources and ways , which are typical for war . this is the penetration into the territory of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kol@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
war every time or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of fav@@ elas in Rio continue to suffer .
one week it is now that the police take the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho valley to av@@ enge the death of a poli@@ cem@@ an .
in the midst of all these violence , this incident made headlines : one or@@ derer died as a result of shots that had fired the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besie@@ ged Syri@@ ans learning to plant mushrooms
scre@@ enshot from the Advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and following civil war , many Syrian cities are suffering under brutal and block@@ ages , mainly by Assad regime .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization Pa@@ x and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ eir O@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of sie@@ ge .
the region of East G@@ hou@@ ta , in particular , affected the lives of hundreds of civilians on 21 August 2013 .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was practiced by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these have been occupied by rebels controlled areas outside of Damascus , which led to residents on local or covered by tunnel and check@@ points .
due to lon@@ gl@@ asting block@@ age , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tainable for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian supporters and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of Eastern G@@ hou@@ ta as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional ones in Syria , and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however its dietary supplement makes it an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the besie@@ ged East G@@ hou@@ ta .
the direc@@ ting of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose the cultivation of mushrooms because they can have a high nutritional value , similar to meat and because one can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed S@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that have been fighting for this project for three years and expressed his relief from making it more and more &quot; to promin@@ ence . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to give 125 family knowledge to planting fungi , so Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around € 12.@@ 700 , but will continue to collect any contributions to Can@@ Do .
the initiative is dependent on generators that hold the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity at 80 % .
because of fuel scar@@ city , locally produced fuel from plastic uses to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they started with &quot; production from the regions of the regions , before they test their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . as this managed , they used a larger tub . and so on .
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms anywhere in the east G@@ hou@@ ta for free .
Dr. Lei@@ la declared that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach the people the mushroom breeding for different reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : frac@@ ture of the sie@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source in the market .
spread of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency , using food @-@ remains ( like paper , tea , coffee set , cart@@ on , etc ) in the extraction of new food .
creation of new jobs , especially for women , who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities that are tied to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to spread this idea all over the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the sie@@ ge will be visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experiences to be inspired in times of crisis and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many district capit@@ ols in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of fires that were r@@ amp@@ ted to the north of Portugal .
forty @-@ two people died , and about 70 were injured due to forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a president .
fires also were registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there have been more than 500 fire@@ erup@@ tions , spread in the north and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and many villages .
in June , in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , there was a similar tragedy where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured by the fires .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest area by satellite photographs , some 500@@ ,000 hectares of wood are burned alone in Portugal - an area of the size of the district Lisbon .
so that you can make a better picture of Ernst &apos;s situation : there is only in 4 districts there is no fire .
all of Portugal is in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - of course ( @ a _ at@@ ans ) 15 October , 2017
some of Twitter @-@ users divided images :
that is Bra@@ ga today night . # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal # Bra@@ ga # Fo@@ g@@ os@@ PT
numerous videos spread in the net and show pictures that allow better insights into the events :
the for@@ dable tragedy ...
the goal of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures with the state .
the people asked themselves why the civil protection was not able to show the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
João Sover@@ al explained the covenant of the farmers of Portugal at the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of open roads that were closed by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen in June as the streets were very late . &quot;
in addition , construction permits are questioned with a high Bran@@ dr@@ isi@@ ko .
a wide @-@ sufficient proposal for the wal@@ let form introduced by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was made up by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the Law , which allowed the peti@@ tions from case to case permitted , when the applicant could be built about means of self @-@ protection , which was an open back door , so that everything was built , &quot; João Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o .
the environment @-@ organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus , trees from slightly burning wood , spread like in a vi@@ cious circle , still spreading to fires of this species .
these issues come along with the fact that the website of the civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as inhabitants searched or tried to contact people via offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they used the own civil protection data using the application fo@@ g@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires .
the project was launched by the developer João Pina in life to simplify the work of fire@@ fighters and was on this f@@ ateful weekend in October , so that the server over@@ took the collection of 400@@ ,000 users who stopped the fires : thereby the page was more than half a million hits .
even the founder asked for help :

the way from the refugee from Afghanistan to the successful entrepreneur

a night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years ago , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ ja@@ he@@ din group@@ ings which had defeated short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair .
just at that time A@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central af@@ gh@@ u@@ sions for the last time with his family at dinner .
even if his mother did not say it at that time , she knew she would not see her son any longer - maybe even more .
in the morning da@@ w@@ ns the boy should open up .
his un@@ cle would pick up him and bring him into the s@@ mug@@ gl@@ ers .

CC @-@ 2.0
Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Haz@@ ara dom@@ ed party E@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat was straight murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt safe .
the Taliban that was well @-@ known for their hatred over Haz@@ ara came closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after its flight , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
he worked for a couple of years in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his low wages , and walked in Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and s@@ lugg@@ ish s@@ acks with mort@@ ar , which were harder than he himself , to earn his living .
back then as today life of Afgh@@ an refugees was marked by poverty and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really tough , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminded of A@@ shar@@ per in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an abandoned building on the job@@ site , where we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no service there and no heating . we p@@ ylon n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so we did not fr@@ y at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ per left his life without papers in Iran and ready for travel to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing of the sea , he suffered a ship@@ wre@@ ck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected its asylum application , A@@ shar@@ per came to Italy in 2002 .
some time spent A@@ sc@@ af homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church who shared twice the day dining to aid .
it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for exp@@ ired asylum seekers . it is true , however , that the conditions that find asylum seekers in the country are disastrous .
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties for Europe writes , the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of the asylum seekers have been accommodated in more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special centre @-@ centre &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; this is a impro@@ mpt@@ u facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception center if they officially launched a request for asylum - which can go for months after the registration of the asylum application .
until then , people who have no money for an accommodation , either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so there is also A@@ shar@@ per .
but his unbelie@@ ving life @-@ cast helped A@@ shar@@ per to get rid of these terms very soon .
after several years of working in construction , A@@ shar@@ per had its total savings in the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this ran so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a s@@ lim@@ bic .
A@@ shar@@ per Bar@@ atis success story is now subject of the documentation &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - an Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film won the Venice City Award for 2017 . it has been presented for the 24th time in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ per Bar@@ ati is before the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Fi@@ ori &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; one of his hostels in Venice . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italians - are very difficult .
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and terms for loans are only some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates there are some 20,000 people living in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years some of the Afgh@@ ans were created , including cutting , travel agents , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant in the Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff are largely refugees from different parts of the world .
the restaurant &apos;s menu relates through the various af@@ gh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy .
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s targets reach far beyond the Italian food industry and the retail and aim back to the country , which he had to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , there are also possibilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily if I know my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of the society and must get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , in which people can learn bag@@ pipes and research techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can sell their seriousness on the market and improve their financial situation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of successful entrepreneurs was a journey through uncertainty and doubts , but in the end there is stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ per has made this journey itself . well , he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this way .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian Parliament reviewed a draft law which fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration in a government authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
users would have to use to use social networks within six months after the successful legislative process by stating their full name as well as its expulsion number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who miss this step could be sentenced to 6 months of imprisonment , or be condemned to a sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law , which was applied by sixty members , is currently the legislative as well as the constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in May , another deputy of Parliament reached a proposal to be introduced in the tougher pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ul@@ ting of the president or a high officials .
under Egyptian right the ins@@ ul@@ ting of the President and government institutions are already stra@@ ined . however , under the law proposition , such a case with Pr@@ ison and fin@@ es would be ign@@ ited , such right @-@ experts of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East policy .
if the law is passed , this can hold up to three years in prison for the crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and assembly has been in danger for many years already . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who took pictures on 13 August 2013 when he demonstrated Egyptian police , while they demonstrated violence against demonstrators , who had fought against the military coup , who had led to the impe@@ achment of the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 protest@@ ors , who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in custody to a court cluster .
recently , his trial was postponed on 20 May , because the prison line according to human rights groups failed to put the accused by the prison in the cour@@ tro@@ om .
