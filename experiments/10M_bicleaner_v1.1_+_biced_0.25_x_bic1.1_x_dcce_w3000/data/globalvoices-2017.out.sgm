<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I have grown up with American movies I have danced to American music, American authors read and operated his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">Indeed, this country had such a profound impact on me that I was mainly due to an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">As the 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as it played the Gray Grantham in The pelican's letter, a terrible reporter, who presented with the aid of Julia Roberts as Jura-Students, who were the Supreme Court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free to Method Man, "I was, as if this is the absolute truth, anything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only enhanced.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very heartfelt love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then, Donald Trump came into operation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about xenophobia and the racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, how it deals with his bottiness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops his mind behind the mountain as he says so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He tells exactly what he thinks like a former colleague put it, and explains publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African American, and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless people responded to his statements and voted in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes, which he won in the Republican elections, was the highest number ever achieved by the nominate candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigest person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't get Trump and won his electorate with the people I had learned during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journal program, takes people from all over the world, a deeply sincere man, with whom I could talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Trumps worldview does not coincide with the "Cincinnati Inquirer" of the present editors of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I had met us with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours playing "Phoenix" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance also stands in contrast to the generosity that I experienced in Sandy Bahr, who fought for life for long life, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me as her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">It still fits in with the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with much patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there was Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those through them embodied my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump entered its way to the nominee Republican candidate, she offered me a stop and the counterpart to his restricted vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps precisely because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they shared either racism and fanaticism or because they were ready to overlook these things, broke me almost the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair of the Trump voters as a racist.</seg>
<seg id="34">The people in order, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates a inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their concerns and fears are not taken into account of the hectic changes in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of which most are white, voted for Trump because they would like to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commentators have commented on a man who look down on those with contempt for those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(D.).: as much as" "" "waking up of white against all other ethnicities;" "" "words from white in reference to the white and whiplash, as it called the big Van Jones, exactly killed what America has made so magnificent." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world estimate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it's nonetheless a powerful idea - which faith or background one may have always, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For that country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose story, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">But with the election of Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of the white America of this promise, and says: to hell with manifold, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this I have to think about Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who is fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a manifestation for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a silently "no!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "if Muslims had a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" disarmament the quantity.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" I answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they called them and their votes were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"could someone who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and vociferous "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is now Trumps country, told the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could find no place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And it breaks my heart to me.</seg>

<seg id="66">From the misery to the stars: these Latin American children do not spoil their love of music through rubbish</seg>
<seg id="67">The "Swiss Instruments" from Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca, with the children of the paraguaean city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music, which is played in both places, not only the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfills, just 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby magnificent ruins and its world-famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now La Banda de Música (Musikbande) has been playing in the community: a young and adult belief orchestra, which has found the way to overcome them with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drugs abuse and banking violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">However, this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot, who started a musical project and the youth thus offered a rare time of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young bandmembers take their commitments to the music group very seriously, says the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run by the dusty streets to follow their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with glittering eyes and playing in the buzz you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, silke, pgos, and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from rubbish</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village that is practically located at the top of the biggest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay capital - on instruments produced from recovered waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with prepared instruments that consist of local firm waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where using the recycling of Favio Chávez began to transform parts of the waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate vulge, violas, celli, contrabasses, guitars, flutes, saxes, trombones and percussion, all made out of the rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article from Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and a musician's teacher of the children of Cateura, reminded the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked at the trash. children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">That changed as Favio something was shown what he had never seen before: one out of waste came from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is an entire orchestra, which plays on instruments from reprepared material and called The recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) draws the musical performance on:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tons of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those with him and of him are the poorest people - like men in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here she turns it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational spectacle from trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra has even played his music for the Pope Francis.</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can fight against illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fought wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically report international, practicable solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication is done within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices on the common use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, then, was known that this ship already had its illegal fishing waters illegal fishing waters, before it was looking for the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries have responded accordingly and little inclined to welcome a legislative burner of this species on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mosambique and the Seychelles mobilised themselves swiftly against the ship. they refused to baptize one of their ports and refused to give him an old fishing package.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly, the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply refused everything," "" "remembers Benedict Kiilu, a leading clerk of the Kenyan fisheries authorities. he is part of a team that was discovered and recorded the ship at the time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Ultimately, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia, for plundering of the fish stocks of the country.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, the criminality practices crossed and protecting resources, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing stop).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries who had at that time expelled the Premier from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries who are like-minded and working together. they exchange information and stand each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, Head of Pew Charitable trust project Ending illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is concealed because it is extremely difficult to record, so that illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By intentional disregard to existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing ecosystems can harm that a delicate equilibrium have.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were forced by bureaucratic hurts and also by the snail speed, with the information between different countries, the actions are happening in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">Here the individual countries can communicate with each other, for example lists of existing licenses, news to suspects activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a harbour.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when moving on the open sea, via satellite.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships which fish in forbidden areas. also, so suspects ad routes - such as those suggest that a ship invites its captured fish on other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such studies can indicate whether the involved ships have a growing licence, where they were travelling and possibly also, whether they have a criminal sister.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries who are against illegal fishing, can refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports. what does that ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they even can even be forced to pay for penalties, such as the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it is about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worth it." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, executive director of NFDS Africa. the latter is an advisory firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to attract estimated 20 million USD to lost revenue, who will lose the eight members of the network HISH-i each year due to illegal fishermen who invade in East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing villages, which attracts the region of commercial fishermen all over the world, including those illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among their practices include actions like the sailing under false flag, counterfeit royals, specifying of fantasies, the fish-protected species and the fish in conservation areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make up the weaknesses of a incomplete control system." says Long. "earlier, a ship could be illegal fishing and a country could then say" You dared my haven't.</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "". "and this legale slip hole is trying to close the FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its foundation, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 studies of demonizing ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks, which had put counterfeit licted licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has found glimpsed ships and found.</seg>
<seg id="128">Thanks to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority for the fight against crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing for large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"some of our studies lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system to help the FISH-i, suspects the ships more precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with friendly permission from FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system that is always further developed, also helps to divide the illegal ships that are happy to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position. and we try to cross," "" "says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO, who also deals with fishing data and FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships also turn off their automatic identification systems, so that they can no longer be ordered by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps therefore to build a system that connects various information levels with one another. it aims to help FISH-i to find a criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">One model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually exert influence on the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believe that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened a platform for Global Fishing Watch, together with Google and the Marine Health Organization Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed globally by means of a single-traceable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "join with neighbours to get a better picture of who he does - that simply makes sense," "" "says he." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global level." "" "Pew Charitable trusts has a similar project to run in which a global system allows tracking of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only serve criminals, but also scare them off.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships having been confiscated in the past without a license and hardly expected to reckon with consequences, we now know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating at FISH-i have since bought a 33% increase in fishing sales, since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had been helped to trace Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board trolling networks, whose use is forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with friendly permission from FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "in West Africa, there are several hundred million dollars of illegal fishing each year." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "in 2015, six countries have joined together, so called the West Africa Task Force." "" "it is now fighting illegal fishing, after exactly the same model as FISH-i." "" "with certainty the goal of making even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions too," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member states appeared in Somalia its first major triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship that was under false flag while not only was the ship without a license and were used shauling networks, which meanwhile are banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also penetrated into the bottled waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "by taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they approach against illegal fishing." "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time proving that such a special, collaborative way of working for the protection of the oceans is actually functioning in the entire world sea.

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of the interview of Alejo Gómez, with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 on Día a Día, an Argentinian news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">In the meantime, Mr. Quijano said now in the context of the great La Perla Ribera process in the province of Cordoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the process, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were examined, which were committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting at the Bürde, to carry the same name as his father, to the brutal military settlements in the prison of La Perla, that he observed at the age of 15, he has suffered.</seg>
<seg id="204">He held the secret of family for 34 years.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I believed that was all right.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a walker.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years of age, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not realize that my father was a thief, torturers and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmerieved. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was in prison in 1976 by 1978, Deputy Commander of intelligence Department 141 in prison La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>

<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who is charged with abduction in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and the abduction of a 10-year child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who had experienced over the years the extent of atrocities that he had experienced as a boy, and who said before a German Tribunal for his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power one parent has over his child and how this child chose a path of salvation.</seg>

<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you have rounded yourself with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Pass merely that she does not lead you one day and I have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The acronym ERP stands for Ejército Cucionario del Pueblo, - revolutionaries's army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers' Party of Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">That is why he offered me to go back to the sports hall. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He said to me, I would be secret.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and I thought I was fine. because, my father had brought me up.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base I had to destroy the papers that had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda stamps, books, simply everything.</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla, all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first and last time he left me in the car entrance.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he commanded me to get off. he led me to a baracke in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - simply everything possible - standing.</seg>
<seg id="233">All of this was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a little in a ceiling topped bag and commanded me to wear it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a great clump of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the Baracke, where stolen objects were put down and entertained me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">Then the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I sewn in and saw a couch, tortured on the human being.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal feather.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached to the one end of a cabinet. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was chained there.</seg>

<seg id="244">Years later, when my father stood under house arrest, the same smell from his room came.</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the smell immediately and I realized that that of the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>

<seg id="249">When my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La cuadra - the area where the prisoners were captivated with handcuffs and bore them.</seg>
<seg id="250">He spoke with "Chubi" Lopez (Jose López, a civilians who also was charged in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people were lying with the face down - everyone was captivated by hands and feet.</seg>

<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and by soldiers killed and buried.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know that because my father told me at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">Beside La cuadra there were some rooms that were designated as offices.</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero has put together a man and killed.</seg>

<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned as a part of the process of dehumanization.</seg>
<seg id="265">When they survived the torture, the prisoners were cast into the cuadra until the order from above came that they should be laid.</seg>

<seg id="288">At that time, the defense, a co-conspire would have been with this crime. I wondered, no problem, they can lay down my burden for what they wanted.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For overhead you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the starting text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter calls for active mastery of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general, the conviction that translators are in the target language - should not be in the initial language - native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">Thus a French speaker, for example, should translate by English into French - not from French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr-Visitors Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as their mother tongue, who may make translations into English. this may fail due to the understanding of the excess, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of English native speakers, the Japanese language.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who do not have a foreign co-worker, do not leave translation internally. then the Japanese employee, whose English is considered to be the best, no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr-Visitors Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The verbose and puzzling sentences caused by mechanical translations show that this technology can still not substitute for a long time. this applies to some languages quite special.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the most strange English formulation in Japan, including the puzzling prints, often used by T-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>

<seg id="465">The sooner they were done with learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But even this time was limited because she had to do dinner for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says, she never had to hungry, but did not get unbounded food. "I was allowed to pick more books from the library of the landlord as a meal from the fridge," she reminds himself.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathisers of the Partido Liberal, a Liberal Party, which was in power from 1954 until 1989, to the opposition.</seg>

<seg id="471">He held it for intelligent, but did not stand with her. "the householder had someone who heard, while he talked about politics," she says.</seg>
<seg id="472">"they did not allow me to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would like to learn" bad habits. "so they said that Alvarenga, who belongs to the Indigenous group of the Guarani, would return home its mother tongue Guarani.</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they had enabled the education they had made to lose, explains them.</seg>
<seg id="474">But she was completely clear that she was getting paid for everything she got from them, with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also in school Alvarenga discriminates discriminated. "one thing about which nearly never been spoken, are harassment and the rails which cries cries are exposed to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately realize that someone who has no parents, a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone to me at home. I did not have friends at school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in time, where friendships develop, I especially noticeable that I was not part of a group.</seg>

<seg id="527">Why is this specific type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">How Raza is shown in the video, "is the Persian leopard the only remaining carnivore in the Kurdish ecosystem," and the health and the prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on that there is a great predatory.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in fact in the free hunting ground is low and goes against zero. when the team in the video makes sure that they all have a large cat in the camera all, craza breaks in pure joy.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from the Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi).</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed on 11 March 2011 by the tsunami and still is the region engaged in reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March, 2017, documented in Japan's daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, the advancements that were achieved during the last six years to reconstruct the lives of those who were affected by the "threefold catastrophe" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, tsunami and an atomic accident in Fukushima had triggered the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper is located in Sendai, which is in the Prefecture of Miyagi. the Prefecture of Miyagi was the prefect of the prefectures in Japan Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring region of Fukushima and Iwate were nationalized since the tsunami had entire coastal cities disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Still, the preacher Fukushima lived a nuclear accident in Fukushima, already on this alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The Special Report of Kahoku Shimpo shows the progress made up of six years after the advancement of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the paper comprises statistics of the Japanese reconstruction authorities as well as survey results of the persons concerned themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses (over the last, saigai kouei jugobu) were completed in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">The biggest success among the three prefectures could find Miyagi, here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has finished 75 percent of these houses, whereas Fukushima forms the final light at Fukushima with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, one still endeavours to settle for six years after the disaster, evacuated by expeditions (over the last, casetsu Yutaku) into final spare-houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the threefold catastrophe almost 80,000 people were forced to live in homes.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there are still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the Fukushima living in emergency shelters still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful at this occasion. more than 75 per cent of the evacuated accommodation, were restrained in final houses after the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="558">The number here is 34 per cent for Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="559">Prefectures of work and everyday work in the three prefect.</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine 1074 of 1100 schools, who were affected by evil, their penfores up to December 2016, which makes nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three Prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 per cent of the Fischereihäfen in Iwate and Miyagi have now been in operation again, at Fukushima only 30 percent of the fishing hops have regained their farm.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident occurred in the three prefect of agrarian land of agrarian and ferodly.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 per cent destroyed agricultural land can be used again in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear issue, since only 690 hectares destroyed by 5 400 hectares destroyed by Fukushima, are in the "nuclear-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures of tourism the tourism has recovered and recovered far away, but Fukushima remains far off here.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are again at 90 per cent at the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only afford 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that since the disaster was nearly half of the coastal inhabitants, it is harder to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a total picture, the paper led numerous surveys under the native population and among the evacuated ones. she interviewed them about the state of rebuilding and also how their feeling has changed from the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey brought that 83.1 percent of local residents who have taken action to be prepared for future earthquake and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of those surveyed that have not been done enough in catastrophes prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it comes to those who had to evacuate the Fukushima prematurely</seg>
<seg id="576">In her release on the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has intensified its attention to the situation of the evacuation from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had not only to experience the enormous earthquakes and the devastating tsunami, no, the preacher Fukushima was also a witness of the worst, catastrophic, nuclear, atomized, the Japan had ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 Americans from Fukushima almost 63 000 people were relocated to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were slightly more than 23 000 people, returned to Fukushima, in long-term spare-houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the date of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In disaster situations, most of the evacuations are still in expeditions, older than 50 years old. they will have to return to correct expeditions because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects will have to compete, the part of the Olympics are to be held in Tokyo.</seg>

<seg id="583">If one encounters people from other countries who speak a different language, the differences seem to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, one often recognizes that one more connects than it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important since they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspective and remind us that the world is ultimately quite small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this sequence of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look at exactly these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast we deal with issues that often get less attention in reporting when they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities between Greek and Turkish; Lieta Camarasa explains how love for music has corrupted its affection for Iranian culture; Adriana Macias talks about the time, where she worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences that he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="627">The parish community Gregorio Arleé MañalI, located in the western Cuban Province of Mayabeque, is commonly known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - well-known, regardless of the fact that there are no appreciable sugar harvested locally.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were laid in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the return, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost gradually and after its installations, until only the scaffold left of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">Approximately 272 workers were forced to reinvent itself.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some may be alternated the job.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resigniers and commute daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a Soldiveteran, which is charged every day at 4: 00 am, the crisis in the sugar cane industry is not depriving of his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there is in the east of the sugar cane factories, which after a long inactive time it returned into operation, because they were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembered exactly that in MañalI would get the cane sugar factory, but the promise has not been kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The cane industry already contradicted the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market price, the inefficiency, the poor administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">By 2016, the production was 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for alarm for the country some decades ago, but the bad harvest was not news anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway station of the church saw already a better time.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane fabrication were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they were intolerable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate on the production on the most efficient factories, the annual production capacity was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories, which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives, which led to such measures were the small productivity of the sugar cane plantations and the rise in the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar price rose more than a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 until 2025 the price of unrefined sugar between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound will be published, according to the 2016 report "agricultural perspectives" by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Economic and Nutrition United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the gross export would be about 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>

<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day with certainty in history," "" "these were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">Since then, the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years the lactation of a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people got their full salary for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened at the sugar factory Gregorio Arlée MañalI on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closing of the factory, is the word he is most repeated, "fraud."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all those questioned are the same opinion: not one of them has been informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">Hence the place will be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first end year, the first letters started to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially distributed documents that were only removed in relation to the parts which would be removed, the addressee and the date differed.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulan Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could authorise any decision.</seg>
<seg id="663">From there the responsibility was over and the letters were becoming more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the bezily factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the still in operation of the sugar mills."</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waiting for retirement in another facility, Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved against his will in the stagnation of the factory, in whose construction he helped.</seg>

<seg id="690">A song by "Home to Me" - assy Narrows First Nation.</seg>

<seg id="692">Youth of the First Nations communities in Canada are dealing with issues that are important to them. they do they using hip-hop, thanks to a number of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, Bosch has been producing mobile studios directly at schools and youth centres in 2014 to teach young audiences such as songwriting, recording, audio- and video production and live appearances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were guided by the pedagogues of David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in North-Quebec with ten cree-communities and then working with the Cree Hip Hop group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop is in a way that the young participants in talks such as "cultural identity, language, debate, love, self acceptance or whatever they want to come into mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youngsters are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian Province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Acsa Gyilak' yoo in the area of the tribe of the kite-Calabrian First Nation in British Columbia, for example, called the History of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a road section in Westkanada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video player to convey to how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs, despite influences by globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people are not always doubtful in the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has been recorded, the chorus of Cree is sung.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved here received some help from Gary Jolly from Northland Hip Hop Group, who gave them a strophe in dialect of Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebookside of N'we Jinan is available to verses in transcription, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German here:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel as if none would ever be interested in me.</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on Earth for my days</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you get to know our scream</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life as youth</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will be raising one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This way they can grow and go ahead as our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they determined the Creator</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan one can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, are located near the entrance Hokuto sanpuru ('the' plastic models of the dishes') from every dish that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers look at these plasticists, and then decide whether they enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the current part of Kappabashi, there are a large number of these small businesses that produce just those three-dimensional dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders started in his film Tokyo-Ga over twenty years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even perceive them any more. a new trend is turning it into striking mobile phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published series of social media links and photos, which make this unusual twist with the shokuto sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic-made mobile ligaments, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods were turned into mosquito nets, as in this case, cooled cupboard magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a couple of shoeing crankboard magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of the essences is becoming increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case a caisen-don (a popular travel bowl with seafood) turned into a mobile phone ring.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as mobile phone rings.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part in Tokyo for the exhibition in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that keeps your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a candle for the mobile, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing approach to the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile devices and mobile-designers allow you to make your own work of art. in this case ikura or salmon-oestrogen is used, a popular topping which is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubt:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there someone who would say there:" "" "wow, cool, now I can release my mobile phone with salmon-rogens?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will probably be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic geriatric may also assume a less appetite form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest cell phone-stands has the form of melted ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and handybands from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can see more skurrile plasma dishes at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter using the hashtag # Testing over to the package.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi who is dedicated to the Believement of the restaurant industry. as for example, with the shokuto sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports at home and foreign media on the infamous "fight against drug trafficking," in Mexico the Verblest and Getöckers regularly gather in statistics. however these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy which this struggle will bring.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reporting on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the leader of the sinaloa-cartels, thrust the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">A day after a violent incident hardly anybody looks to the dream or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">In doing so, behind every corpse, behind each bonding is in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories innumerable parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">That is why the Mexican real estate site Animal Político thedigital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with drug trafficking 'lives and stories of people who are told through the struggle between law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal poltico describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime not only lets us fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if stores are closing, because they are threatened by drug retailers and therefore need to drive whole churches so many kilometres to buy something as creeping like milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">Pain of victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video titled "Vidas que cambian por el miedo" (german language: "as fear lives changed") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">One main character is Guadalupe, a father, who has kept secret tombs after his son every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost only one day their father, their four siblings, their husband and two of their nephew.</seg>
<seg id="762">"" "Priests:" "" "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today again for the task we have placed to go to, and to graves after the people we loved." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="774">We don't only have to show the faces of those who are afraid of. we have to show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the government.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a lesbian from Animal político, wrote this post in Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered as normal, regardless of what form it appears:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with disease and sensation journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I'm coming to newspaper publishing every day and see the front pages with pictures, which actually only can come from a textbook on criminology or from files of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only ones that am hindered or sad. it acts like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to that body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent here or consider it to be normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">It continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants Narco (German: drug dealers) if he is great. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroism" of the offenders "when going through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me that's how would they inflate those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happened to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories to mere figures become statistics in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the insomnia of the people is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students are justified in a neighbouring village that they were" "" "aufässig" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to talk about being spared from such tragedies if they are not stirred and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City was screened the post "four months blackmailin the main city district: how a family has been looted by threats," in it describes how armed criminal month had grown up for month money from their business until it was destroyed not only the business but also their family was torn apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The ache over it passes never, the trauma stays, the fear comes back high once you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, telephone numbers as well.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The further we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She excluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will detract or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days if wines would resolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the reply is no, because I forgot how to cries. I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the post "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: one of the recorded generation of violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he throws questions on how: who cares about the child of an missed wife and a man who was murdered by the organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous town of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a guard and he tells he had to teach himself how to cook a egg, potatoes sown, tortillas warm and "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water, sugar and milk pulverages.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy who consists of violence and had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother has disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood has been past two years earlier, when he was just a few blocks from his home, who saw the bloody trap of his father, shot by armed men out of a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez was like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of the killings for public security and government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the prosecutor of 3103 Morde. this equates to 8.5 Morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of thousands that organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories live in the face of more and more recent headlines. but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," animal journalism project called Narcodata in existence, whose objective is to tormented the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking in which the country has tortured in the last four decades in an understandable way.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact-check is important in a moment when it comes to uplifting a rumour or forflaring a forgery.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the year after something the first time has appeared? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to persist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let's take this picture of a terrible accident involving seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release, it has been used to treat tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of image and event - "false description" or "false context" in terminology from Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is abundant reporting about events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our longing for pictures to messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a petrol trucks entailed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, kicked off and exploded. in doing so, 230 people came to life.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war Africa became a second-largest country for years and thereby devastated. the roads in the region became a dangerous pathways full of potholes who were difficult to walk.</seg>

<seg id="829">Houses plasted and blackened corpses were scattered in the streets scattered.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to the immactical.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "That is Nigeria." from the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Multiere photos of the incident form the gray-scale sceneries of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of hollow bodies that are ranked on the ground while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But the story here is not its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same picture has been tampered with several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, and are not mistaken in connection with the tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram on the remote-Nigerian towns Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses caused a drastic increase of atrocities that they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and corpse were in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "nobody stayed back to count corpses," "" "said a resident to Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images, the following time could be visualized.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the army aided in Baga was a permanent conflict-conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt at Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, when it was presented as proof of the fact and the potential extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">You are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this improper use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of misfortunes; Africa check has documented asorders for Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all of these cases the picture was presented as a testament to mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further brings personal comments such as the image from DR Congo, with sources of mass media in relation to arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange joined in Myanmar with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya.</seg>

<seg id="912">This article from 2014 about students who had been killed by the Boko Haram, published by the now deleted news page Análisis Digital, expressly consents that the image is not derived from the killings, but it claims that it had a "similar spleen" attack.</seg>

<seg id="918">The picture was weathered as evidence of the Boko Haram 2015 by Boko Haram 2015 (and more than 9.300 men saved). but the messages that were associated with it were raised in no religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">The goal was to focus attention to the relative number of dead and a comparison of media reports compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (Portuguese), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message that was alleged to have been written by a "Pater Juan Carlos Martos" over the Nigerian massacre, we took a discussion like this here in Vietnamese and explained to the wrong message.</seg>
<seg id="922">From the Embassy in which the image was contained in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the organisation of the Claretfed Missionaries and Pater Juan Carlos Martos.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (framing) that crosses these poets. the first frame is focused on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions on the silence of Christians by Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the assassination of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how a African life is valued as compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion is to understand and the value of human life is both important and therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question is, however, what happens when readers can no longer believe this painting.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media there are people who have unintentionally taken part of doing the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this mood of the mis- and miscredential that actual atrocities are untrue and narered it the actual Greys of what actually happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in Nigeria and in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of clamped images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that returning from images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes, these images are even called by the victims itself.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent paintings readers and viewers desensitise, and they have the ability to feel empathy (for example, this study, which examined how violent media act to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there are some regarding violent depictions in the news media, the fact is that it is indispensable for today's news reports.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologist is experimenting with algorithms to assist the fight against "Fake News". you will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something that can actually be abolished from the context or completely misused species.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untranslatable (e. g. replaceable) tries to offer language skills a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to be translated at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words exist in each language: they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these insurmountable words are already well known (like the famous Portuguese suction) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (such as the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But they all resist each attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">"" "a word or expression is not sufficient, why a full explanation and sometimes some context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word." ""</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and Linguist von "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find for example words from the Mwotene language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- Take care of your parents in recognition of the way around you in your recent years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsuscal language spoken in parts of Brazil such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - the convenience or laziness that makes you feel after watching early days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They compensate other cultures, revealing other thought-length and wake up our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this site would like to publish more of these "insurable" words and show how different, valuable and impressively these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be an opportunity to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) the enumeration of stories in their original language is the possible response to it.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird, the unpredictable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here however, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already conducted events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite as small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project the following applies:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that have diversity - safe spaces in which inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to be part of.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listen often with it," "" "refer to these events instead" "" "listening to estimate, to feel, to make." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format you can tell and translate their story first in their own language, or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional dance-storyteller, their devotion and presentation make sure that the audience is getting into it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions when the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video illustrates for example a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the story-storyteller Rassidatou can also be explained the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative of the stories.</seg>

<seg id="1151">You were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were entirely with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">Up to now, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities and the organizers hope to expand this out. all who are inspired by the project can contact TLS in order to organize their own storytellers.</seg>

<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and is here licence-free, contains a number of papers that deal with the free culture in the face of repression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction there is:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book will discuss how movements can be built for free knowledge, and what the real costs are, with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers and writers, who are involved in the movements for free knowledge, have worked on page to go through the fog that surrounds our newsletters and to create something from our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free bassel Khartabil, the beloved and sophisticated Internet volunteers, which has been detained in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted from the Adra-prison directory in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title of collective remembrance gives his friends and family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us start to think about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>

<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of time-wise convictions?</seg>

<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, has played a crucial role to expand access to internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, Technologist and at the moment passed the Director of New Palmyra, a project that founded the Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basque cultural prototypes were prescient than the work he began with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins Palmyra virtually.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites of the world, was the trail of many civilizations and here merge Greek-Roman architecture-types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Then, Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he started with this work, the IS would put everything in it, this architecture that is not only embodied by the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This foray in digital archaeology and conservation has created a timeframe which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel was not able to complete this project so far.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I've spent my whole life with it, of freedom to dream and bait taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English in even when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read English well, write and speak.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always shared his knowledge with each one who asked. he has taught other detainees to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened my door to the technology. he taught me to use both computer and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought the internet to me.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically without they actually kept a holding in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a proclamation, which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for a year.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted to a corrupture with anger, and a governmental member after half of his sentence returned to the workplace in the state apparatus, where the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">They were arrested by Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and four other defendants in 2010 (about 800 000 Euros) sentenced to 22 years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money was from public funds of the airports of Mozambique, whose advice Cambaza stood between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 due to good guidance and immediately asked his reinstatement to the company what happened on 19th April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with an opinion of the General Physical Law of the Republic of the Republic, the application for granted, there would be no obstacles for Cambaza to come back to his old positions, as the company doesn't re-establish a disciplinary treatment after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many residents do not mean the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Center for Public integrity (Centro de Integrated dade Pública, briefly CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned in an interview with the Deutsche Welle relying the decision of the company to restore the director again:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a backward step with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">"" "" "" "what we take note is that the company should have supposed to have a disciplinarity against the resists." ""</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company apparently led and anchor no adequate legal steps to apply the appropriate functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "Egídio Vaz, an important voice in the Mosaic social media, this behaviour also declines and considers the case as" "" "resist." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">When Cambaza was a competent type, he would be a consultant, after he was sentenced to a prison, and half has drowned.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could give paid lectures and motivating discourses, he could advise and polishing his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has agreed to integrate into the company that he helped harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore, it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradicting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, Young Mosambique and Student der Political Science in Brazil says, the director makes no morals:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he insulted him, I can not believe someone was rewarded in such a way that the state has already been offended so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks morality and serve the State, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the State, but instead serves only by the State.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as hand is an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and ultimately sentenced to a long prison.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Makeel, to remind that a thief is in jail:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Ieves belong to the prison of Samora Machines will not only be remembered as the first independent president, but also as a scarlet, intersecting and - incidentally - prophesied speakers.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations was, when he proved energetic, that "an ambitious man is capable of everything, also the fatherland for its ambition, his own individual interest, to sell."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said: "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it is not that way. he changes the tactics, but he does not approach his ambitions.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net, because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">"" "although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East-Indian origin or generally used as an adjective" "" "Indian" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censored the word "Kalar" or 'Recordal font) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma into the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In the last few years, the rise of radical national movements has given the word an extremely-expectant connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that mostly used from ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically appeal to hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed in the purpose of his use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Furthermore there are several burial words with fundamental different meanings, which have the same code as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair on Burmically also 'Kalar htaing' written, which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar Pae' (spherbse), 'Kalar oat' (Kamel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooker Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends has been deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way whether she knew how he could alleviate his back pain by doing a wordplay.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The Sku la - "curing" (ku) + the Frageword (la) on Burmeso - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is the opinion that she would be combatting hate language more radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook will be analytic that it would be any Posts, who are in suspicion of racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism is not understood what you write to facades.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to analyze the mail carefully and control it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"" "for example" "" "Kalar Htine" "" "(chair) and" "" "Kalar Pae" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these three-legged nationalists who spread hate speech, get a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to curvy its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to everyone who disseminate hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and Wechat have proven that the censorship of keywords often will start a catamaran and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply to start to use a new word or an alternative writing-wise word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to clear his posts as he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I got attentive to this new directive from Facebook, I made a mail to tell my Facebook friends that the Word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited the Liken, post and sharing of content for 24 hours, because the post "Post community does not entailed the Facebook community."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of poets from people who have no negative intentions or which simply try to show their opinions against hate speech more radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech by Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his mind about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine thinks that Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative, for example the Burmese internet community ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to lessen racism in Burma by its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "" "" "to censorably such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities." ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "in addition, it seems as if it had started this without local context or technical support and so words like" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "peas curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they have made mistakes, they don't tried to correct the adulterated posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits that they have a great turnover, it would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facades automatic censorship has ensured a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make themselves funny and know the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots from Facebook Posts, which contained no hate speech but nevertheless removed:</seg>

<seg id="1345">Prior to this amendment of the German Act, several members agreed to militarized and Muslim religious communities. at that time, brother Harryperad Maharaj, the leaders of the interreligious organization (IRO), a group, the representatives of the various religious groups of the land gathered, that the state does not interfere, since that, age do not define the maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contracting of the UN Human Rights Convention, the minors as, "defined every human being under the age of 18.</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics from the UN in 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children which were already married with 15, in Trinidad and Tobago for 2.8 percent, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011 the statistical centre of the country confirmed that of 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys below 19 were married.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements, which strives to run laws on the nursery, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring this outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "a Hindu leader, for example, had no concerns to say about the critics of the children's marriage, they should take care of their own affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition provided for tension in this really complicated matter, and at some point came doubts as to whether the opposition would not agree to the bill of law.</seg>
<seg id="1353">At the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided by law against children's marriage - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of opposition and an independent, which could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "now only the president of the country must agree and proclaim the law." ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the senators of the country presented on Facebook a Status Update, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram has posted:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill introduced against the children's marriage was held in the House of Representatives with 35 votes against it and none other.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After he previously agreed in the Senate, the design can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were enthralled because the laws of childbirth have finally been changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook-member Lovell Francis, who disguised a ministry in the Education Ministry, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has done so much time and unnecessary talk that has vanishes the core of the matter, but do you know what? the nursery is in Trinidad and Tobago for now, and this is worth almost every prize.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson of the mind was, it was definitely long enough time to put the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day was finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says:,, Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The spouses have been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, voices - 35 for it - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group, which openly spoke openly about it, how important the adoption of the law was, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The pagan age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious denominations 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft of the Act has been adopted today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">In the House of Representatives there are 41 members and of them 35 were present during the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All MEPs who were against them have voted for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Children's marriage is no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long battle (...) # childrind '.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all activists who have contributed him.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thank you to our MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Maharaj therefore, the Secretary General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organisation in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj announced his intention to take judicial steps, the law should be passed and he seems to make his promises now.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the general Advocate Paris Al-wi, a proponent of the Act, said it would be quite legitimate if Maharaj would act against the law, that most social media users would like to approach the debate differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of discussing the discussion so generally, in a way that only panic and melancholy may cause that the state, our daughters are protecting them that they are likely to be displeased by large, hard-found men who are compared to them, "would you then be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you believe that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">Yet whether or not it comes to a criminal action against the law, or not, this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where children's before in different gradations are legal or the norm continues, though there are laws they say.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was represented on 18 January 2012, contradictory to the SOPA (stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright laws in the US, internationally.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month Turkey has now moved the popular and crowdsourcing principle based on crowdsourcing principle based on Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day will be more evident, how important the platform for users is to find helpful as well as reliable information and to share.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporter and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many techniques-versed Internet users used to use detachments for blocked websites (an up-to-date article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third-largest VPN-prevalence of the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been posted since 2008 articles by Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; regular reporting of the internet since 2007, after the Internet Act (5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">To China Turkey is the two-known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked there are now several mirrorsites (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and often be updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">One solution obtained from IPFS (the Interplan File System), when the platform put all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized Peer-to-peer network (so remote host connections) which does not base itself on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is provided in spite of the legal ban.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogger post IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the news (via the blockage of Wikipedia), we put everything in terms of snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, the possibility to read the content on decentralized and distributed manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least check all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the site www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS was also stated that this step is independent of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the web site.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansirenown .org, a horror of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrorsites if in the respective country is being blocked.</seg>

<seg id="1409">There is no complete copy of one proxy, a mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You fall into another URL, which is not the original one. that which one sees then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server directs the request to the right Wikipedia-page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia yourself if it is locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Because this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate game of wildlife!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested from home when suddenly reapuraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida lodge). he had received a call from my father that would be a leopard on the bank of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river river is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran out with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side, where the leopard was lying and I immediately began to kneeled pictures!!</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content-sharing convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women are avoiding the greatest care to speak the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead they use a pronoun or say" "" "father of my child" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women that they respect the husband's social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences they should pay the norm to this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was condemned by a cabinet from the Indian state of Odisha and disowned by her family and the village community after having heard a married relatives with its name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives also do not name their wives, is also common among men. however, they have much less permissions to fear, if any, they should not comply with this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walh in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health professionals and housewives, a unique club and were thus rapidly becoming the main chatty of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place just for them alone, where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of the 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # Khelbaal campaign launched by the community Video Volunteers and advocates the exploitation of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas has been working with the help of its video camera with the help of its video camera to cover practice, such as children's marriage up to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected members, and guides these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports on how these clubs are created a safe place for these women and at the same time they made ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini was shown in their discussion, was the women who don't name their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which the women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Speaking out of the name of their husbands, a Bring, whom they have accepted all our dutifully and never asked questions.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini writes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testified that a woman wishes her husband and wishes him long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not obey that is considered sneaky, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never had thought of this discussion before.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who previously did not name her husband by the name of herself, wanted to try out at home how it works.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussions with her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband doutweigh for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I ought to call him from now on in his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self confidence in luggage, Rohini started their first issue.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" never before. some felt that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the lap, Rohini showed a video about the problem of Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to tell the name of her husband with different emotions - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked all, "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they may call us how they want, does that mean they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walh in Maharashtra about the breaking of a centuries-old tradition, in the married women speak the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she kicked her whole practice just before her; another decided to engage the whole of the frustration against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the adrenaline rush on, with an ancestral brine, the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their husbands' name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they stopped their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband's husband called Rohini and asked what ideas they put in my head: his wife could not stop to say his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner before the entire family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in mother she staring her, she got scared and said that there was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said, I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in France was less understanding, and the situation was inexperienced in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reported how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing a cinored spot on the forehead, which shows the Eat:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "" "" "I said to my husband that I would bear the galvanising red point if he also does it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughs only and I heard him to wear it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely ceased, but they mean they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion sklub is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we are doing a trip on each issue." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack up lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want the women to worry about who you could hear, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated her own birthdays with cakes for the first time in her life; they danced and sang about things they had never done before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">For so many years I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have talked about some things, for example our identities on our spouses are never so honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things out loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a panel discussion, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women have been in the group since their marriage only Saris.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most it is okay, but some wanted to wear a Salman-Kurta a vast hemord over a pants, they did not drink.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much dispute and discussion about the advantages of his own clothes, morality, with the Saris and a lot more, smuggling Rohini with its own pair of Curtas (Oberinhiden) in a panel discussion, so that women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will succeed.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question, if in the five months since their first discussion had already changed a little, Rohini confirmed that things were slowly coming into roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then I got back to say the name of their husten.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it yet, but only if they are alone and are not members of other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands. only one or two women now carry on their forehead at any time on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discsionskate know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like listening to more freedom of movement or their own clothes-choice - at the end of a hard navigating river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How raw ini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us confidence that will change something.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it's not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman enters the club home and reported other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers Community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories about which are not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">These stories are "messages of those who are experiencing themselves" and offer a hyperlocal context to report about global human rights and development policies.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which probably was recently been done.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally released on 8 July 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version is published under a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The fall of the alleged Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer was announced at the end of June that he has been delivered to hospital for liver cancer at the end of June.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009 Liu was condemned to 11 years in prison for "Subversion" (state of state) after calling on the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that advocacy the democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The State Department of China has called Lius case as "an internal affair, and a speaker, he considered it" not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country. "</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China still receives calls from the international community, the Nobel laureates and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to enable or allow him a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out to the issue.</seg>

<seg id="1640">Norway's prime minister Erna Solberg and foreign minister Børring Brenda have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway was stalled when the Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to Liu for the Nobel Peace Prize 2010, although the Norwegian government argue that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations have continued until the end of December last year. only in June Norway was signed an agreement to resume the salmon sweeping to China, since exports had been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously suffering, the Nobel Committees transferred his hope for a unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question might seem foolish as Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, Imugam, Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This observation has spared a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the former Chamber of Commerce Association of the State of New York, the Minister expressed that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore, as compared to Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He assures that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether new York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is where most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice," "" "rotate the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrificed to create this valuable land, we can say that ultimately we are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the semblance of fleeing the responsibilities, a mandatory.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons were not very posable: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in the face of its, it inevitably appeared undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities which are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once one reaches the core point of the topic, the good old body reappears from the authoritarian rulers to be the democrats, leave the twisted logic as it adapts better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the answers given during the last week of Shanghamalgam were given answers to his American guests in relation to our press, our Judictative, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He had the appropriate question with non-answers of the rational kind.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanghgam to make his mind clear, because that conclusion did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city is, thus to which country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">Short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">"" "" "" "I would be very grateful if our precious K Shanghgam would take the effort to clarify this point if it was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1709">By placing on the blog its comment, he tells about the reviews that one should begin to read the whole transcript of the conference to better understand the context of the statements of Shanghgam, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore is rather a" "" "city" "", "he explained why the elections in Singapore will be so unequalled, even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He placed Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of those cities saw a party in decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore" "" "is not a country," "" "he obviously not meant it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment at Shanghgam, who as the leader of a growing generation, which makes a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am talking about what the Minister of Justice in Singapore said, very embarrassed...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - do I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanghgam, a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure whether he truly believes it is true and conscious of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek review breaks the weaknesses of the forces of Shangri-Arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "has Mr. Shanghamalgam" "" "rejected a mistake" "" "or was it a bonding teacher?" ""</seg>

<seg id="1729">"I did not say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This proposition seems to have annoyed many parts of Singapur...</seg>

<seg id="1745">On my clear position then follow the default irt: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians might cook inwardly in anger, if they are held for Americans, but I don't bother that.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know, there is little that differs us to Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians make a Canadian flag well visible at their rucksack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All dear Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans now....</seg>
<seg id="1750">It was also the case when I started travelling through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and 11 September.</seg>

<seg id="1769">If Canada really would be a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" no personality has.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing that you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless, means inconspicuous and uninteresting and no attention to deserve.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good when you want to stay unnoticed in the background, away from the things that happen to pass.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and being alone, a main objective for Canadians.</seg>

<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells him what rules his girlfriend makes.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly politically, the music video refers directly to the continuing military rule of the junta.</seg>

<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta continued to pursue is their decision to buy expensive U-boats, although security experts they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the path of migrants to cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is managed by a 59- year-old Mexico, a small woman with a coral-pink eyewear and gold-colored ear-rings in teddy bears form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Afrikaner and Haitian who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2.50 Dollar per night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with high-stole walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian migrants are coming here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez, people come to the full busses and from the upper part of the coast begin to call: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mum Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At present it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept out on cardboard boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">You would like to refuse no one else.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to hospital when they are sick, they buy them medication they can't pay, they masses them with a balm the tiring from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently in a short time.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if mama Africa is a reasonable nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui, who has a yoghure) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracking.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">It has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiano travels with his sister who hopes to come to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">You have lived in Brazil, however it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and move toward the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other imitators of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well known name on the route," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitian and Africans often travel the way together and that Africans already speak on Whatsapp of Ms Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before in Brazil and worked as a construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football club.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been guest in Mum Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket by Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again," he answers smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells that their guests send their often text messages if they left to grind her or to report to her about the course of her trip.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the power of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She does not know much about Africa, but her guests are taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known, but it is not the only spark of hope for migrants travelling through tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the town a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">In this winter, Valenzuela and its family have taken migrants in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">"" "" "" "he is a policeman and has established that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive." ""</seg>
<seg id="1939">He started helping them to get a decent price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night offered.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment are 25 people there, mainly Haitian.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on blankets to the bottom, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking niche.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela states that he knows what the guests are doing through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I have lived in the United States," "" "he says." "" "I experienced what they experience." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border to the desert and we have suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he became a raid on his post office from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through tapachula comes from Central America, other inhabitants will also open the doors of their houses to them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he has fled to people in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to get blackmailed by him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and had an unknown, a single traveller, offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family lives still here and she is trying to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa is all back full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses, travellers need to consult their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus is arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that their house is full, but she is also nostalgically, because of those who have gone.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a glorious grandmother, she's fed her album with a lot of photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair care who has made her a manifestation, some photos of her grand children and many travellers more, boy and Old.</seg>

<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile users were instructed in the Tianshan District of the City of Urumqi, in which she points the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>

<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police, the app has to investigate the springs and distribution routes of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as below:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blockade pornographically web pages, from online fraud, Trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to control their own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filtering for minors is meant to help the children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>

<seg id="1972">"" "for example, the" "" "remote control" "" "government or even hacker can manipulate the home network of a person or to steal from it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in harmony with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reports on digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often grimmer for those who live in remote, printed ethnic minority regions like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict-areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and monitoring measures as well as routinsensitive Internet sealing.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Based on Twitter-based media outlets "Images from mainland China" (the 'Recover' Recover ', the censored news in China published, showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen will then re-audited whether they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian are certain that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that the people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a back-back for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">You have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by The rest of the world.</seg>

<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" (all over the move ', also published a Jingwang product description, out of which proceeds, that the software can lift the hallmark of a Windows operating system and can get full access to your computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones are to be used in Xinjiang.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang are possibly a response to the instructions of the city of Party to minimize the distribution of illegal contents.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All governmental organisations, authorities and associated facilities, including universities and research facilities are required to follow the instructions of Cybersecurity Office in operation of their computers and communications.</seg>

<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos" and destroy them. however, this action hurt the personal rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and provides penalties for a whole range of other possible waste, including those who relate to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2062">When and how that happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Some voice in me said that I had to get used to it or used to be punished, although I had nothing done to make this punishment.</seg>
<seg id="2064">On penalty in all their variety.</seg>

<seg id="2073">Within one hour three of them alternated three of them, while I was still in the row.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I listened to scream.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The jordan Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends the most of his time inside; sometimes he lodges to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, every now and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can count on is a cigarette between its fingers or its with nicotine to discover lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top-floor of his family house that had been hearing them since 1967; the year in which Israel exercised His occupation of the West Bank and Hdaib's family had forced itself to flee their village in Palestine, in which they had lived as felicyees (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years Hdaib has been a passionate activist who presents the conservative majority and questioned her old well-proven opinions about gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and raphy.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, who often deals with issues like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only found in his hometown Amman Relative, but also in cities that are ranging from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With its 25 years Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not limited by limits in his thinking, and according to his own statement with the people who suffer the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if it does not open it openly, it is a special aversion to the US American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war areas, something with his identity as a "Palestinian refugees" - so he describes himself even though he was born in Jordan, who has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I do not think about my own living circumstances so," Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so because I am a man," while he poured into water solvent in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; at this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Hungarian law also states that public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has some weakness for it to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has to do with a scorching hot Junitag little with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the swarms speak a warm coffee and the waistulas of the Kent-cigarette in the nose first and foremost of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when looking at a view of neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">It is therefore avoidable to do basic things - just as in the public during Ramadan to drink water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordaniens had a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians, who support the Islamic action of action - the national branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontsheets Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MEP and former spokesperson in the Islamic coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert "had just been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many are also asserting that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous militism that questioned the trusted legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the whole region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila underlined the jordan people as a "progressive support of human rights," which will continue to stand for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should probably not be simply silken or rhetoric, it is actually an ever more clearly crystallized reality in Jordan reflect the work in Hdaib's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib's traditional gender standards become a body by emitting his vision of the fate of Arab women who have marital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a clearly scammed unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless men who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years, Jordan has increased the number of "Honorary murders" - the inofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch the number of Honorary murders reached its peak in 2016. however, it is still difficult that Jordan has been missing the institutional infrastructure to aid the women who tried to be victims of murders or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on overworking fighting in 1954, women may be exposed to the risk of interacting force, "for indefinite period in prison," and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee from the family necessary that the woman will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaib music enjoys great popularity and is well-known for it to shy away from issues that are long as tabu in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but recognizes that he is his music, the full explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression, not separate from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, Man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">I was intervened in politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed, Hdaib is taking on the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and" "" "Ghareeb" "", "the focus is on poverty again." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that is political at the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib released a song called "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is there."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get in his words "what you want" - be it faith or non-faith, heterogeneous or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been strongly censored up until in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib led an interview for the popular regulatory Onlineprogramme Roya, to later note that his comments were swept out of the context and censored by his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but it has only been working-worked version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib acquires open to the Arab Republic of TQ + Community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals are not speaking of Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuts, a poet of the 8th century, which still has remained in mind thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nueva claimed to work later on behalf of the calibration later, in the eighth century to write openly about homosexuality, why can Jordanian parliament not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemitic kingdom there is nothing more new that the government is sanctioned by attacks on freedom of speech and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the jordi syndicate recorded several former governmental authorities and members of the teacher's association, with the reason they would have expressed criticism in social media critical about the problems that are deeply rooted in the country deeply rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">According to this, the concert Hdaibs is according to the opinion that only the tip of the iceberg - the actual challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordi ier.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a constant place for giving and taking. Jordan has subsequently forged the way for the second time in a row but the path of progress - this is Hdaib - consists of slow, opting and inner changes. it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Muslim society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, also of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He did not only dreams of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but to experience "it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region helps with music, art and literature from a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, streams and by artificial way of mastering democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it has come, Hdaib will continue and therefore also resist.</seg>

<seg id="2150">These large, extravagant warriors are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories of origin of the Nebuta festivals.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One assumed that there is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohocus. another theory indicates that the fortresses, drumming and dancing over more than one thousand years have been handed over and from a time taken in the armies from the West Japan to the north-east to force the indigenous people of the region, the Emishi to force the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We could pick up some great seats, so we got a super view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">It is difficult to imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A joint centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, hosted a two-month exhibition to Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I looked at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fixed cars are just visible.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, will take the 'Nebuta Festival the only true one - and an admirable way to spend their summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>

<seg id="2162">The sight of a 18 meter high car was incredible.</seg>

<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's major port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where road predatory and illegal drugs trading are daily.</seg>

<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the fallen hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Brazil), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to being more and more normal citizens in the experienced hands of hairdressers who can form these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">"" "the unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme boundaries of imagination and creativity, even has inspired an annual event, competition of the hairdresser" "" "Batalla de Barberos" "", "who has been running since 2014." ""</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: love notes to guerrilla warfare</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the revised version of the article "love-ships in guerrilla warfare," which has published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love notes to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not so much more important, people who have been able to spend with affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Precisely this question went by the two young Colombian activists, Leonardo Párraga from the Foundation Bogota and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation is no longer the head and inspired her to write to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliación (letters for reconciliation) that encourage young people to write letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently, her land was a rogue of a historic event, and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Internationally, the signatories of the peace treaty was considered so significant that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But before the Colombian, there is still a long way to get there from a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla warfare, which had been used for many years in illicit production, had been exposed to a war rhetorical rhetoric and carried on arms around the clock, now have to re-integrate itself into the life of a civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian company again, which had become accustomed to living in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guerrilla war, must now absorb into their ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"" "" "" "Leonardo and Cristian" "" "we were convinced that the young columnist would have to close and help with the integration process." ""</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that is exactly what they did: up to now thousands of young people have written letters - loves meetings at former guerilla to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerilla, which should then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for letters to reconciliation was born on the world summit of the Nobel Peace Prize winner who took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to briefly speak with Kailash Satyarthi where the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This stated that we love the people who love to write to Valentine's Day of love, but those forget that they need much more necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plan, he related to share his love with people this year, which needed the most urgent confirmation.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and establish a new life. "letters will show that the Colombian company is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far more than 2000 letters were collected within the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombian such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that someone would forgive me "</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN-camps in the Caldono region on 19th March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students of the university Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation Bogota reisten to the camp to personally transfer letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC set themselves as they had done before to capture the precepts of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very movable moment for all involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings can go through within just a couple of hours - from fear to luck and everything in between," told the political scientist Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a staff of the governors of the Province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience, such as:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we had passed the letters, a former fighter carried me through the camp of the guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">"" "when I entered into one of the" "" "Cambuches" "" "(a sort of hut in which the guerrilla war) saw, I saw a guerilla which wrote something." ""</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because along with it on bed was a MGL-pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the Dornröschenbezzf.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "then I said to him and asked," "" "hello, what do they do?" "" "he answered," "" "I answer a letter I wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life someone has written something so beautiful, that is why I answer it. suddenly, I suddenly walked the tears over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him quite tight and set me next to the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war, I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companions of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never wanted to join something else from life than war. to join the FARC, the only way to save him and his six brothers from hunger. "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside, which waits for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">In prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC came to a discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students had grown up all grown up as already war and the FARC already participated in the dark.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore the leaders of the FARC the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views about the peace process: "for many years we have seen how social injustice by the state into the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to shaping the society in that country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a purpose of this scale, it is worth to overcome all the obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who have never heard heard before and had no electoral law and know that the people I've seen often seen as a monster and even hate me, too were people with beautiful feelings which were turned through their circumstances and environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all men - including those who have killed and so much damage, can bring us something together and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander at the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The columbianists was declared that after the disarming peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are prepared to stand up arms and protest for their rights. and this is also fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC now rely on peace, to a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defender of peace - regardless of race, religion or ideology - to rise above all who dream of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give to you our word, make our contribution and bring victims, because we know from their own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence, will be ahead many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2262">"" "when I was here to show a few shopping bag from the backseat of my car, I heard a man's voice," "" "Here is a gift for you from your uncle." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body but did nothing hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard another sentence, but this time in Chechen: "how long will you still want to dishonyour family, you scandstain?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I knew the person not.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I just know, that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost the consciousness and woke up in the hospital again.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had gotten everything and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called for an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I faded two keypoints in my right lung-wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in what language poultry were you placed - in the men or the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there my male name is still standing, but the doctor understood and placed me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I got to do it with the fear; it was a Muslim, a caulitic name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has been respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote to me - Related, stranger, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The demanded to return to Chechnya to prove that this was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They presented absurd demands: some said to me I must prove it by being above without the streets; others wanted me to have noticed in official TV in Grosny and say that I had not changed my gender that everything was bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have Körbchensize C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">"" "" "" "some older men once spoke my mother on the street." ""</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world that has not only ashamed your family, but the whole of the Republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much and she placed himself a strick around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved her.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, the window stood up a car with dark window washers and a numerical sign with a 95 roof.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Once it happened for the third time, I realized that there was a little lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human right friends overbeat the numerical depictions - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you fled?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to reveal their names but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something terrible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before leaving Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I had arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without having to register without any identification, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast them in the rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came out and checked in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card in my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">In the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't think about, you are confident, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know what hotel you want. they even know your number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was indeed my number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we do not talk about the sex balance, that is a tablotopic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally Caucasian elements are still wearing me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, this spiritual barrier cannot be overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chatting with camera, I actually give me effort to look at the person they remember from their past - that is, in my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those that have stayed with the dorsal?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report to Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to someone who has saved the one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during the Ramadan, he had no man arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait and he didn't lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"" "this means that I, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the issue with the person concerned and at the end request that the so-called" "" "honor" "" "experience the so-called" "" "honor" "" "by blood satisfaction." ""</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there still some gay men in these secrecy?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there was not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then especially those who have no rich relatives or have been dropped by their relatives to face Kadyrows Court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can present them later than terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "should they be killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim them, they could have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but specifically submerged to radicalize themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a presumption or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was detained in the one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people in this prison were gone, after their beard grows.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has since been nothing new from them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They have just taken them with them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, that person was with him when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Up to now, they were not presented as bandits, but there have been no reports yet. we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why otherwise would it not have allowed this person to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation already occurred in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always carried my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya, I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003, I was already very well known when I lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999 when the sharia was considered, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "but Russia originally wanted to lead us to" "" "civilized" "" "but ultimately has thrown back to the stoneage." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were hatched; I had colored eyelashes, wearing rocking jeans and a short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The safety of the Sharia has never hmmed me only a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, a whole group of people like me met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a speech: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Spotte not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">You often say it to children, if people make themselves fun over the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just got their eyes closed to you, because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yeah.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never offended me, never hunted and never struck.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this worship stay last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long before Kadyrow came on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak on TV about morality.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He was not talking about us, but rather about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how the people in the city started to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">He who was in the faint and laughed on the ground, viewed you on a one hand with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I got back home, I could sense how the situation in the Republic was constantly worse.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity are you now going?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't condensed a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Aside from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">I am currently responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of Psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organise teacreffs, gathering, I join them to hospital and help them to get cries.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I do not have a penny for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I have discovered these people themselves, when I slipped shelter.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: are you looking for a trip?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is nichew.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is pure and nothing has to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chetschenen, who want to prophesy with foam in front of the mouth, that there are no coils at them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">"" "the Dagestans have what the Cabal have, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet there are they - but" "" "not in Chechnya." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">Here I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims, who go to the mosque and fasten during the Ramadan - live with men together.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know many think in Transitive identity to men who love men and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of sensation to be exact, different ways of living.</seg>
<seg id="2391">It is most important for me to feel myself in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry, I'm going to be back in person here, but my last intimate relationship is already more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all because - I just know I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn of an increase in suicides within the impoverished Arab Ahmaazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">Iranian Ahwaz region is suffering from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty-rate among the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">There has been a strong rise in suicides for the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim MorAmazi on August 27 back the desperate situation of the Arab imwazi community in Iran, which is shaped by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had one child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he ashamed of his own helplessness that can count the incapacity for his family, such as Ahmaazi rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video clip was held on YouTube after he had ignited for himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people managed to clear the flames again, and Moraci was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the town of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the deflations were so strong that doctors could no longer do anything.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide, which occurred in August within the Arab Ahmaazi minority, and campaigners to warn of that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahmaazi Centre for Human Rights revealed this month a few others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shawn Bani Tamim.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family-athers, who felt helpless and impotent due to the persecution by the Iranian government, helpless and impotent to feed their families and follow a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahmaazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, in which a large part of Iran lived in Iran, was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the local Arab population to establish their livelihoods.</seg>
<seg id="2412">In a century ago the Arabic ancestry was an influential region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took power over and 1925 huge efforts began to end the ethnic autonomy in Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most traditional and most valuable areas of farming.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite this valuable resource, the regional economy is continuing to develop slowly, and the native population gets only little of that wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated disease, famine and privation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime denied the Ahwazi Arabs systematic jobs in local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a variety of dams, the waters of the Arab areas into the Persian areas, where the provinces Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are located.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to worsen the devastation in the region caused by dryness and devastate local farmers and fish and palm trees industries.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi youth now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Muhammad Pur, the Iranian Director-General for cooperatives, work and social welfare, applied that 5% of the Ahmaazis who have completed a job, completed 55% a further school and have 45% university degrees.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian, ancestral human rights activist with resident in London, told Global Voices, that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment, and racist ethnic discrimination," resulted in a "high rise" of the number of suicides among young Ahmaazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that especially unemployment has grown worse. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ahwaz's new ethnies and an anti-Arab discrimination in the employment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since Functionaries and institutions are not preferred by Arab labor force, the local Arab Ahmaazi of access to job opportunities are entailed in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national Resistance of young Arabs and force them to earn their living outside of their homeland.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their ancestor and surname to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi and be so attached, as even the Arabic name at the workplace will not be tolerated, let the speech of Arabic language or wearing arabic clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances, which must endure the Arab imwazi, human rights defenders alarm, before the situation is explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is unimportant depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is avoidable.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I do not identify with feminism, also with the intersectional dissectional"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion which was written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the Afroféminas website. the article was the article of several discussions in which many different positions have been expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who describe themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be the feminist and why we generally all feminist * should be inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, that women today still earn less money in spite of equal education than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observance when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women come in early or later in various areas of life to a smoother blanket and that discrimination are still flowing through the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I am at double and threefold.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I come to talk on skin colour, on racism, on black CIS, on black women in the LGBTQ commune or on black women from the Diaspora, when I talk of what type we've been physically, mentally and verbal, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists are to be silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But nevertheless all agreed that women - all women - should come together to lift their voices and to sing 'Kumbaya, my lord' to sing the equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about that there is in addition to sexualised violence an institutionalized form of racist-motivated violence that we are exposed to black women at two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and provenance are less money than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girl and girls often referred to school with a migrational background than white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want that all women, all men and all human beings have neither skin color the same rights; on the other hand, I cannot connect myself as black lady, into whose centre the white woman stands refuses to relate to injustices contained in her thinking, which relates both to the gender and to the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I'm exhausted and will no longer fight for my membership in a white-feminized spheres, who always rejected me and countless other black women and again and again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "Sojourner mourned in her speech in 1851:" "" "I am not a woman?" "" "and I don't want to maintain a ideology intending an ideology in which the black lady is a dramatic and marginalized Being." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to rejoin me, which also absorb through cultural inclinations of our customs and customs, to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer seek to give white women the importance of overlapping of skin color and gender. for some of them continue to mention the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women different kinds of homes and pinpoint out of white feminism, the word "feminism is still in his name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release me fully and totally of feminism and join the movement of Womanism that is being called to live for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of engaging me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that interventionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">It is more important than ever before us to define black women according to our own ideas and engage us into the spheres, which are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weem, the author of the book Africana UAE: reclaiming (about: Africa-Womanism: as we can defend ourselves), that we can defend ourselves by creating our own forms and in which the cultural, spiritual, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be revered, which make the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists are instantly call separatism and exclusion after they have read these lines, I ask you to inform yourself of the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement from which the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a blurry environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized because of my dark skin and on the basis of my existence as a woman, as part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can blossom in an environment where my life is not over, nor ignored, still rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and edited version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" by Currenters. the article belongs to the series # PorserMujer (# refused) which covers about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most of the names were changed to the protection of the persons concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police attack said Ada Báez that they had nothing against Luis Balbuena, their expartners who had become violent over against Violence.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of her relationship a little time passed and the police said, her statement would be put to the acts, but more could not do.</seg>
<seg id="2484">As another woman Balbuena on the mistreation showed, also the aktenant display of Ada Báez does not show anything.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman returned to her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">When women ask at all, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases the women are also financially dependent on the men who are mistreated. this explains why only 20% of all women who admit victims to be victims of violence, log in at all with law enforcement authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Inhalation 1 thugs and statistic 2 immortality and a legal system that nothing undermmed 3 Paraguay laws: good approach, deficient implementation rackge and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is difficult to determine how many women really are mistreed, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues in the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social research institution in Paraguay. "there are different indications and reports, but not even approaches how to demonstrate the level of gender violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2491">But the available figures are however alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015 at the Increwing Office, 9600 indicators were directed to domestic violence. at 70% of them, it went on violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the people in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence during the peace treaties. also, 86% of the indicators came to show.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the adverts, 40% of women said that they were physically mistreated, 55% of women spoke of psychic mistics.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics reveal not the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayan's Minister of Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes will actually be shown. "on each woman, which in Paraguay because of psychological abuse will be refunded, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">On any woman who would be refunded due to physical abuse, two women, who do not, "stated it at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">As women's suicide in Paraguay is not an own criminal offence, the law enforcement agencies can not document properly just how many women are murdered by their current or former partners each year.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Until August 2016, journalists have at least 12 cases of women's icide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez was a firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the name of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At first she didn't want to do that, but then still there was. this was supposed to regret it forever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old, and no longer with Carlos. but two years ago she endured the psychological violence, one of the most common forms of violence against women, and at the same time the most difficult recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that only women happen to be subservient because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never ever happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana useless social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote posts on facebook, in which they described his insults and various attacks during their two years relationship described and told how he had isolated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever had raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they had won this so long by Carlos and did not leave him before.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least have had to blame for their crimes.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, which is not from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner suspicious them.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"" "Victoria is a member of the" "" "Yo te CREO (" "" "I believe you" "" ") that is made of women all in some way victims of abuse." ""</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychic abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her affluent partner even managed to persuade her to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias advertisements in the authorities remained without a result and also by their relatives, they received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It led a process against their former partners who developed into an inconsistent legal struggle between Paraguay and their homeland, where it was mainly about money, power and influence of its former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2531">The original bill of the law foreseeable to explain Femizid into an independent criminal offence and to punish tougher on how it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">So the legislature has changed in some points in order to also win MEPs to the Law, and they feared that the path for decriminalisation may be paved, which is currently banned in Paraguay and punished for up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill introduced, most of the (bureaucratic and economic) charges, which have to present the victims of violence at the present time, if they just want to report and obtain a secure accommodation, to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri arguing that the law is not effective, if the legislator does not provide sufficient financial resources for this purpose:</seg>

<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was adopted in the paraguayischen Senate. previously, parts of the law were however changed. among other things, a passage was painted, which caused the partners in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for aggressor, to attack his victim again.</seg>

<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need on-site medical research. there are two reasons: for a lack of healthcare professionals, many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have wide grave consequences in the poorest countries as elsewhere, and missing investments for research on these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research, which is conducted by African scientists, with the creation of own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to economic growth in the continent.</seg>

<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he scrutinized himself on HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the Sámi health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrior discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media on this research.</seg>

<seg id="2600">Furthermore, I just started a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostics tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think is the important current science topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>

<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is a need for specific scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer sciences, big data, research of outer space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe us the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa to Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, it is the limited speed, things to do and the startling access to scientific expertise that represent challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines are accessible only against payment (the so called "Paywall"), also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change worldwide food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This entry by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine about solution opportunities for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton's breeding had been in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredth, the first plant, which has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronomers in the space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Almost 20 years ago, Mortons's work was achieved only by its own resourcefulness and the question of how many salads can get there.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s he noticed that more salads were patented and that he therefore could not use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patent stands not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties, such as resistance, diseases, a special red or green tone, or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years more and more of such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or Karting varieties. because of these trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and expert for food security are the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionately representative of a millennia of tradition, Morton still preserves the salad, he doesn't need for it anymore since his work is getting more and more difficult due to more limitations.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it's like to lie in a river a rock that I have to paddle.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "thus we need to do that now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think these patents go far too far." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stick to judgment, no one can breed any more new species of salt because all the features are patented. so he is doing so good as possible and tried to cultivate those characteristics he would like.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and tries to use no material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is becoming ever increasing in the U.S. and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("open source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts from the International Space station ISS have cultivated red Römeralat the variety outredny in the "greenhouse" of the station and eaten. there will be tested whether plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement out of the IT field, and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "open-source" seed) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, which provides alternatives to protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was called into life to ensure that some plant species and -gens are not protected as intellectual property and can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, U.S. breeders can commit themselves to being able to use the seeds to use seeds from them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they are not continuing to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open source" breeders allow for others who do seeds to breed, to breed through their own varieties, and not immediately descriptive - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Dark prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For empowering Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-board member, Jack Kloppenburg are control over the seed and the possibility to breed new plants, both important for food security and for environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds can therefore play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement is not occupied with genetically modified crops.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants might be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or Monsanto and Bayer, who want to buy good food and sustainably produced vegetables, which is offered for example on farmers market, should also know that the way in which the vegetables are cultivated.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutritionists without seed sovereignty is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative pledge to provide other seeds for their seeds to be freely available to others. in contrast, their procedures are to patent in contrast to patent-fine and plant-characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered since the available genuine pool is due to the ever-wide intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always more restrictive, ceaselessly shrinking.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of the Ossi, has engaged in their doctoral work with a genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found that about a third of all cardboard-characteristics are protected as intellectual property, ensuring that it is not difficult or usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, there are not such estimates yet, but experts like Luby suspect that saturated plants such as wheat are patented in an even larger style than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are cultivated so that they have targeted features - from those, through which their taste or colour improves to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and increase threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders due to more and more patents decreases. genetic variety is now more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse than ever prior to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail Monsanto-Speak in Carly Scaduto indicate that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monkey activities. with a total of four major banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to maintaining a genetic variety.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts that intellectual property reserves other breeders, as" "" "patents and the protection of plant-varied innovations promote." "" "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can observe once the patent expires." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method of the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "" "" "such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes it by providing more material and know-how to the public." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees the other: 20 years to wait until a patent expires, certainly does not provide any innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you need to wait for so long to breed on plants that are adapted to the changed environment conditions, one would have already lost the struggle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general public and should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monary incentives have not appealing for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us, and it will make us impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">Altogether, Morton goes to the concept to patent, which means that the characteristics would not really create itself.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants do they form themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol landpe, plant breeder in the US-state Oregon and Ossi-board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "those who breed a variety also covers its own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with big farms and monocultures, for their cultivation of massaging Herbicides, are breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is just" "" "contrary." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (those who are on international markets, but less than Monsanto are) patents, you manage to survive most small seed companies, even without patents - either they reject it, or they keep it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile, or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for in his growthgarten salads.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton, moreover, the opinion that breeders through the Avoid of plant-patented products would be innovative: "it looks as if I had to produce something new with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than corporations.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need constantly new material for my catalog, as I know my competitors are selling my varieties within a couple of years, "he says." with a patent, you're protected against competition for 20 years, so that in my opinion make it very nice. "</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the USA seem to be a leader in the "open source" breeding, but the concept has spread rapidly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources, an "open-source" seed program works the center with farmers and helps them to grow new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organization and blog are the latest goals in the censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Still only locks Egyptian authorities on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend around 5 August, the Egyptian government began the website of the Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights abuses in Egypt and the Arab world, and reported beyond words.</seg>
<seg id="2724">August, the network published an opinion on Facebook where it criticized the Egyptian authorities for this step, and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">To defend the Network for Human Rights Information - in spite of this attack and understanding of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities, who are supposed to defend their goal in this part of the world, so it was never been so difficult as it is now. FEHRI confirms that all technical possibilities were fully exploited to overcome the blockage and not to give up. we insist that our task will continue to fulfil.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is regarded as the first censored site of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked more than two months 21 web pages, such as the independent news page MADA Masr, Arab-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Qatar emerging network of Al Jazeera because of alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of web lateral barriers to the victim please. @ anhri is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arab language https: / / t.co / NIZmopDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, there is also no access to the blog of the Colombian and Human Rights scientist Ahmed Gamal Ziada.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada supports his blog for the spread of Colombians and articles, which he writes for in Egypt, accessible web sites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he was directed to bypass the censors of the Egyptian government, even the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Bloggers, who is a provider of Canada, also located in Canada, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity since he was arrested by Egyptian armed forces during December 2013 and recorded a video on how the police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada on the blocking of the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs of blogs are very old, however, has a priority in the era of Abdel fatally alSisi; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is nonetheless for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It is managed to give me the feeling of a siege for me; a arrest, a attempted murder, subsuming at the national Security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I wrote not in vain. in other words, my words have an influence, if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to the post of articles to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">However, after being locked and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mugs walk the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE) imprisoned Egyptian authorities from May 24 to 06. August 133 websites. these include technical tests in the networks of different internet service providers (ISP), e.g. orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the block of suppliers via bypassing by internets and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th we noticed how the blockage of web sites that VPNs started.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the intention of the government to block content and filter, to have access to the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation in addition makes it worse that the censors are made behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis, using which they can proceed to trial against such actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian army in a bet in favelas in Niterói, a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro, during the government's crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2752">Photo by: Estado Maior (CML) via photos públicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Day by day newspapers in the whole of Brazil with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcards.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of the headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year-old school shot" "", "Jewelve is murdered in Rio de Janeiro," "" "Diebe rob pharmacy with military arms," "" "President Timer sends to 8500 soldiers of the Army, Marine and Air Force to Rio." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the force of force in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian government, Global Justice, even called the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these are now daily and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the manager of a local paper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">For detailed reporting of violence in the Rio known newspaper "Extra" on August 16 the editorial "This is not normal" in which she announced a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the newspaper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in any major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sex crimes, etc. everything, but what happens from the civilised standard and what only in Rio is published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists don't close our eyes off their cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guach, the editor of the newspaper, that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war of war in a country that doesn't recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video a journalist of the newspaper, that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 843 areas are given that are controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war course, if it is distorted, can also be used, atrocities of the police, who only upset and then ask questions to cover.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the struggle against corruption in the police, whose objective is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Did the name "war" more than they benefit?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil is arguing the journalist Cecília Oliveira against the violence as "war." this is because of their opinion a justification of the security policy by the media and could make it more difficult to account for authority in the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - like extra in the analysis of the military deployments in Rio itself - in combination with adequate investment in personnel, education and a historical and self-sufficiency of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">To remember: the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2776">Photo by: Fernando Frazão / Agência Brasil. publishing with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2777">Rio de Janeiro as "the most violent place in Brazil" is false according to Cecília: "22 of the 30-violent cities in Brazil lies according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country. this is the most up-to-date data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">If we look at the Mordata per federal state, Rio has No. 16, "writes it.</seg>
<seg id="2780">Extra belongs to the company Globo, the largest media company of South America, which stresses, as in Cecília, has repeatedly said the security policy of the state.</seg>
<seg id="2781">In addition to these security policy measures also the foundation of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a set of police set up by the federal state Rio in 2003, whose objective is to use a massive police force on Favela and to stay a unit permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually resulted in a reduction of violent deaths. since some years, the UPP however, for several reports on registers and repressions against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly established police unit, increasingly under attack.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux is one of his articles in the year 2010, in which he explains why violence in Rio has not set the criteria set out for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war is also causing serious consequences for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="2786">"" "for this calls upon the state to use resources and ways, which are typical for war. this is the penetration into the territory of a" "" "enemy" "", "in which a civil war is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for" "" "Kollateral damage" "" "and" "" "" "" "" "" "" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2787">War every time or forth, fact is that the inhabitants of favelas in Rio continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week it is now that the police take the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho valley to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all these violence, this incident made headlines: one orderer died as a result of shots that had fired the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and following civil war, many Syrian cities are suffering under brutal and blockages, mainly by Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization Pax and the Forschungsinstitut The Syria Institute, are located in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ozzor and Idlib currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The region of East Ghouta, in particular, affected the lives of hundreds of civilians on 21 August 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was practiced by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these have been occupied by rebels controlled areas outside of Damascus, which led to residents on local or covered by tunnel and checkpoints.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Due to longlasting blockage, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian supporters and academics teaches the inhabitants of Eastern Ghouta as they can plant their own mushrooms as "life-saving food."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and lead the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the traditional ones in Syria, and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine. however its dietary supplement makes it an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The directing of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>

<seg id="2816">At the time of the Constitution of this article they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around €12.700, but will continue to collect any contributions to CanDo.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative is dependent on generators that hold the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity at 80%.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many district capitols in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of fires that were rampted to the north of Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died, and about 70 were injured due to forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a president.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires also were registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there have been more than 500 fireeruptions, spread in the north and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and many villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, in Pedrógão Grande, there was a similar tragedy where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured by the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors the forest area by satellite photographs, some 500,000 hectares of wood are burned alone in Portugal - an area of the size of the district Lisbon.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of Ernst's situation: there is only in 4 districts there is no fire.</seg>

<seg id="2846">The people asked themselves why the civil protection was not able to show the extent of the tragedy as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2847">João Soveral explained the covenant of the farmers of Portugal at the newspaper Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">After Pedrógão, streets and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday did not do this anywhere: there are dozens of open roads that were closed by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">In the forest of Leiria, a similar tragedy could happen in June as the streets were very late. "</seg>
<seg id="2851">In addition, construction permits are questioned with a high Brandrisiko.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A wide-sufficient proposal for the wallet form introduced by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was made up by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government led a loosening of the Law, which allowed the petitions from case to case permitted, when the applicant could be built about means of self-protection, which was an open back door, so that everything was built," João Sorval in the same article of the newspaper Público.</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environment-organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees from slightly burning wood, spread like in a vicious circle, still spreading to fires of this species.</seg>
<seg id="2855">These issues come along with the fact that the website of the civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, as inhabitants searched or tried to contact people via offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: they used the own civil protection data using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched by the developer João Pina in life to simplify the work of firefighters and was on this fateful weekend in October, so that the server overtook the collection of 400,000 users who stopped the fires: thereby the page was more than half a million hits.</seg>

<seg id="2885">The Taliban that was well-known for their hatred over Hazara came closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after its flight, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">He worked for a couple of years in a coal mine. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wages, and walked in Iran. once again, he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and sluggish sacks with mortar, which were harder than he himself, to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then as today life of Afghan refugees was marked by poverty and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "it was really tough," "" "reminded of Asharper in an interview with Global Voices." "" "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an abandoned building on the jobsite, where we also worked." ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no service there and no heating. we pylon nylon in front of the open windows so we did not fry at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharper left his life without papers in Iran and ready for travel to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing of the sea, he suffered a shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected its asylum application, Asharper came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time spent Ascaf homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church who shared twice the day dining to aid.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for expired asylum seekers. it is true, however, that the conditions that find asylum seekers in the country are disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties for Europe writes, the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of the asylum seekers have been accommodated in more than 3000" "" "special centre-centre" "". "this is a impromptu facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared staff." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception center if they officially launched a request for asylum - which can go for months after the registration of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for an accommodation, either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So there is also Asharper.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unbelieving life-cast helped Asharper to get rid of these terms very soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of working in construction, Asharper had its total savings in the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This ran so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a slimbic.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharper Baratis success story is now subject of the documentation "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - an Hazara in Italy") of the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">A lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and terms for loans are only some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates there are some 20,000 people living in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years some of the Afghans were created, including cutting, travel agents, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant in the Orient Experience, where the waiter and the kitchen staff are largely refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The restaurant's menu relates through the various afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the Pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a Sushi Restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Asharafs targets reach far beyond the Italian food industry and the retail and aim back to the country, which he had to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where there is a risk, there are also possibilities," "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily if I know my people suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>

<seg id="2925">"" "Asharaf also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, in which people can learn bagpipes and research techniques." "" "they can sell their seriousness on the market and improve their financial situation" "", "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of successful entrepreneurs was a journey through uncertainty and doubts, but in the end there is stability and prosperity.</seg>

<seg id="2936">In May, another deputy of Parliament reached a proposal to be introduced in the tougher penalties for the insulting of the president or a high officials.</seg>
