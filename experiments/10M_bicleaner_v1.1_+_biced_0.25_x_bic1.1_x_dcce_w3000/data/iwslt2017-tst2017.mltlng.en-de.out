this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him , because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize in New York Times .
long before anyone heard about Edward Snowden , R@@ isen wrote a book in which it was spectacular , that the NSA inf@@ ring@@ es illeg@@ ally from Americans .
but it is another chapter that should make a lasting impression .
in this he describes a catastrop@@ hic US intelligence intervention , where the CIA literally delivered dra@@ fts for an atomic bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an unbelievable story .
but do you know who the chapters did not coinci@@ de ?
the U.S. government .
for nearly 10 years , the government has established against ben@@ ign and urged him to name its alleged sources .
in this move he became a symbol of the pattern of the government , wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers condem@@ ns and repor@@ ters to be sp@@ ined .
according to the first constitutional record , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right , if media does not get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the mud that they disclose .
thus , when the government with R@@ isen , he did something that many courageous repor@@ ters had already done before him : he refused , and said that he would prefer to go into prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen therefore lived with the risk to go into prison .
yet then , just days before the process , something happens .
suddenly , though they have spent years of information , that it would be crucial in their case the demands of the government on cr@@ ats were dropped .
the reason : in the time electronic monitoring the repor@@ ters and sources are getting less and less hidden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather than fail and bring cr@@ ats to the statements , it could also get his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so the investig@@ ators have kept secret , without his consent , his phone references .
just like its e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its lending , and even traveling @-@ links with the list of its flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn for Jeffrey Ster@@ ling , a CIA ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and Ris@@ ens .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect his attack , wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers . but instead , the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments together .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too much dependent on its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of having a wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers turned into a journalist .
so we put the press work on the game , which is to be safegu@@ ar@@ ded by the first constitutional claim , because the government has more and more possibilities to pi@@ ate all .
but just as technology of the government allows to byp@@ ass the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can take the moment in which they contact , instead of entering in the after@@ ward .
today there are communication software that still didn &apos;t give when it had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ drop , an open @-@ source transm@@ itter system for wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the advent of Aaron Swar@@ tz , and today is from the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I work , developed further .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , like the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , like any ordinary mail .
these will be encrypted and stored on a server where only the relevant message agency has access .
so the government cannot proc@@ ure more information secretly , and many of the information it would be requested would not be available from the outset .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is but a small part of the whole , to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are constantly developing new es@@ pi@@ onage technologies that are jeop@@ ardi@@ zing us all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to us to make sure that not only technology transfer to Edward Snowden have a way to do mis@@ deeds . it is just as important as we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lack of problems in the supply of soldiers and who knows of crowded hospitals . or the next environmental labor@@ er who strikes the alarm to the contaminated water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a wall street , which warns us before the next financial crisis .
nevertheless , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crime but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the largest data le@@ ak of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &#93; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; &#91; the &#93; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; &#91; ... &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ate Robert Pal@@ mer from Global Wit@@ ness by an explanation . &#93; this week we were sent by messages about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the law office of Mos@@ ca Fon@@ se@@ ca .
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mos@@ elle Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set it up ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Islands prime minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that a Al@@ ly of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bashar al @-@ Assad &apos;s po@@ stage firms in tax hav@@ ens .
it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin , through a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ists .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others who are waiting to wait for the next release , and to the next exposed documents .
now it sounds like the P@@ lot of an agency &apos;s representative or John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham &apos;s wife .
it seems cri@@ es away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens , not all of their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that affects all of us .
for my organisation , global Wit@@ ness , these revelations have been phenomenal .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax hav@@ ens are used by some of them to hide and conce@@ de their assets -- something that we have for ten years discuss and disclose .
I think many people will be very confusing this whole world and it is difficult to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ lip .
so one has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to truly understand who is behind these grow@@ ths .
it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters is .
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on the matter in the USA .
presumably because there has hitherto been no prominent Americans who in these revelations , this sc@@ andal occurred .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens .
but the principle according to which these tax hav@@ ens work , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
if we would have a data le@@ ak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples to see the connections in the US .
in fact , it is so that in some U.S. states you need less information , to provide less information to found a company as to get a reference ID .
this type of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school @-@ districts to gam@@ ble in school children .
it has permitted sc@@ ams to gam@@ ble particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks .
how does it work ?
so we sent a covered inquiries to the offices of 13 An@@ wal@@ ts@@ firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ators turned out to be African ministers , who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really shocked that all up to a lawyer made our investig@@ ators suggestions as he could transfer his money .
these were all pre @-@ meetings . none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course , nobody has been handed over to anyone , but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer , who submitted some suggestions to our secret investigations .
it is not about a single top political , implic@@ it in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , through the corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability .
and in order to cope with this , we must change the rules .
we need to change the rules to ag@@ grav@@ ate this kind of behavior .
this may sound very in@@ tim@@ ately , as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing has ever changed , as if it is always the rich and the powerful ones .
but as a depend@@ able optim@@ ist I quite see that a lot has begun to change .
during the last few years we have seen pre@@ fers more transparency regarding what the owners of companies are concerned .
the topic gained political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU is based in central reg@@ isters at the national level , who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind .
representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both parliament@@ arians , but it is not the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the U.S. and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ lamps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need executives in the economy , who stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and apply this kind of transparency through laws this kind of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together , we can finish the in@@ transparent , which now allows this type of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ undering , finally finish .
this is the story , as I had once almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and have landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after having completed my design study , I made a back @-@ sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da remained standing and looked at my things .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and made a road trip all the country . afterwards , he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him on a beer . he excit@@ edly told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where sleeps you tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing worse , &quot; I do not know yet . &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who knows the situation not ?
will I now have to offer a sleeping place ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I don &apos;t want to wind up in the trunk of a Maz@@ da !
this is a small piece of luggage !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have a air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said one voice in my head : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uh , how to ask ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I stum@@ bled to the blan@@ ket and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what I got into it ?
a wild @-@ est@@ ran@@ ch in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of the bed , hanging on the tips of the door , and closed my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the artwork that he had bought from me depends in its classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my view .
maybe the people who were sold to me as a stranger , really friends , who were just waiting to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air mattress , was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress up .
let &apos;s take a jump , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate gets out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all the hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create , fear in fun .
I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I laid down how we could earn something about it . our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers are staying with us sleeping , WiFi and a desk , including a mattress and each morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a site and founded so &quot; air mattresses and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on air mattress at wooden floors .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ O@@ mel@@ et@@ ts tasted completely different , because we made it for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we finished our last guest and the door in the castle fell , r@@ ting Brian and I sat down .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
the things came into the roles .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as developer .
we wanted to find out if one could make this business concept .
so we presented ourselves to the investors : &quot; we would like to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors you are included when visiting .
over the Internet , they can then invite other foreign people to stay with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we waited that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
nobody , who is still quite sol@@ ace , would invest in a business , the strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we all have learned that strangers are dangerous .
when you have a problem , you go to the things that one can do well . we have been able to design .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create trust through design , between people who never met before .
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with Design ?
I would like to give you a ta@@ way , which degree confidence we put together .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your Com@@ for@@ tz@@ one .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
now I like to unlock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ ne@@ cked cell phone to your left side .
this quietly alignment of panic that you can now feel -- -- is exactly what you feel when opening the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your text , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked cell of a stranger in their hands ?
the majority feel the responsibility .
so also most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
only times , who actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile phone ?
could you pre@@ ach on Twitter that he is can@@ di@@ ted to the President of the President ?
you can return the phones now .
they now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbour would have imagined only once with his name ; if he would have told what he comes from , how his dog or her children are called ?
imagine you could have 150 Be@@ jud@@ gements that all say : &quot; he can really very well dis@@ coura@@ ging mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ known feedback system increases trust .
at the beginning we have done some things wrong .
it was hard for people to release negative evaluations .
ultimately we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had submitted their evaluations before we made it online .
last week we discovered something new .
we carried out a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how probable it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are about age and dwelling .
little surprise we trust the people most , most of us are most similar .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social pre@@ d@@ judi@@ ce .
thrilling is when you add the call of a person -- in our case through jud@@ gements .
when you have less than three evaluations , nothing changes .
but one has more than ten , it changes everything .
a good reputation is similarities .
so the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
furthermore , we learned that confidence is dependent on how much you need from them .
here you see the reactions to the first news of a guest .
if one tells too little how for example &quot; hi ! &quot; you do not get an answer .
you are told a lot , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother , &quot; -- -- the request is rather not accepted .
so there is an optimal level of openness , such as &quot; unbelievable works of art in your home ! I make my family holiday . &quot;
how can I create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct quantity of text . we also give tips on what subjects to write something .
our entire company builds on hoping that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against foreigners .
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices .
here you can see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can recognize three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second : the tirel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a need that has not been covered before .
for us the business is running very well .
of course , there are times even if not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have un@@ allowed parties to have celebrated or dwell@@ ed .
host have guests in the rain .
in the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service . all phone calls directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls , it hur@@ ts , if I just think about it .
the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers , was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve .
fortunately , the 123 million found a problem only a fraction per cent .
for people trust each other rightly .
when confidence works , it can create curi@@ osi@@ ties .
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host takes him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation .
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travellers , who tend to sleep because of sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals .
Javier and Alej@@ andra are a real gu@@ ardian angel who can save life even though they don &apos;t know properly .
you drive one in your own car to hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a byp@@ ass .
because they don &apos;t want you feel lonely , they bring books past .
they can even longer stay longer without paying the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so of course does not run every stay .
but these relations behind the pure money @-@ transaction are exactly what one wants to achieve with the Share economy .
when I was proud about this term for the first time , I wondered :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions ?
it is here an economic trade .
but it is now simply to call &quot; rental industry &quot; the thing will not do justice .
Share Economy describes a trade , that promises human relationships .
people place a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
when you travel nowadays , that is to be compared with Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if at any place you were visited , a group there would wait to wait a thorough , and to show a bar in a bar , which one has never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
these days , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to create apartments from the ground up to the opposite side ?
what would it look like ?
what if cities would have to deal with the thoughts of the common part ?
I imagine cities that allow society and relationships , instead of lon@@ eliness and de@@ preci@@ ation .
South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul has already started this project . many parking spaces that the government belonged .
are now residents offered . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were sent to people whose children were moved . there were In@@ cub@@ ator programs started ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . our platform alone will be hosted by 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries by a stranger , or even host .
the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ invent the wheel .
hospitality was there even before .
there were already similar websites in front of us .
so why has our works ?
apart from luck and timing , we realize that you can find the right design with the components of the trust .
design can help us overcome deeply ing@@ ra@@ ined prejudices .
I find that amaz@@ ingly ,
down@@ wards .
I have to contem@@ plate each time when a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great impact , I wonder what we can use design soon .
thanks .
what do you think , if you want to see me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or sup@@ press , a bra@@ in@@ washing , or a terrorist attack ?
or simply a delay at the security que at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions .
that &apos;s how the media represent people who look like me .
one study revealed that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people do not speak to their drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to meet you .
I say to you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted
a g@@ ag@@ m @-@ like @-@ fan@@ atics in ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual mus@@ li@@ in .
but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I was not born that way .
I decided to do that .
when I was 17 years old I met my decision to ou@@ tre@@ ach me .
no , not as homo@@ sexual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I chose the Hi@@ j@@ ab to wear my head@@ gear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why are you op@@ pressor yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the som@@ ber was : at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence , namely against the pressure which I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt to a perfect and in@@ accessible beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Quran .
I read it , thought , asked , asked , and believed in .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow commitment that deep@@ ened with each reading of the Quran .
the beauty of the rhythm makes me sometimes a we@@ eping thing .
I know myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that somebody is percei@@ ving you completely , and yet somehow likes ?
it feels that way .
later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived basically the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then this terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was sitting in my kitchen , had to finish breakfast , looking at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ il@@ log@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as Rauch was Rauch , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people don@@ ate from the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical error ?
my shock turned quickly into outra@@ ge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; why should we do something like this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I changed the TV channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mecca ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my god .
it is not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u related the deeds of others by a citizens in one susp@@ ects .
on the same day , we had to travel through the Middle West of the USA to start a new city and start building .
I remember that when we drove it -- so deep it went down into my seat , and I feared the first time to be recognized as Muslim .
we moved to our apartment that night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then , I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations , said : &quot; be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; silk careful , &quot; &quot; w@@ ret@@ ched in well lit areas , &quot; Ver@@ sam@@ pled you not . &quot;
I stayed in the whole week .
then Friday was in that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
and again the warnings : &quot; does not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting .
the feelings were , understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people that man was holding in the outdoors and hit the outdoors .
there were really Bran@@ dan@@ ts on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who had attacked this country , attacked our country .
I have refused the anger of people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to have to explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today we can actually hear people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we start it ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and make mos@@ ques .
they speak of my community like from a tumor in the US .
it arises only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ or removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor , one only keeps under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first @-@ men and Olympi@@ ac@@ ics .
will the closing of mos@@ ques America make safer ?
it might open a few parking places but not stop terror .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to a people of other faith tolerant , and to show greater citizens &apos; participation .
and as I told a head of the police in the Washington , DC , told me : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed before a computer .
the radic@@ alization process has been found that it starts online . as a result , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family , that the extre@@ mi@@ ths may be a brain @-@ bra@@ in@@ washing , that believes that the person might be the true Muslims , and anyone who desp@@ ises their behaviour and ideology is a tra@@ itor , or the faith .
if we want to avoid radic@@ alization , we have to stop people to the mosque .
some are still claiming that Islam is a non @-@ violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a man , I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would past@@ ed ourselves into its imagination if one recognizes it as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you cast a look at it , it is not what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they can read through these things into the scriptures .
an outstanding Ima@@ m told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him , because she had imagined to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . every cl@@ ergy , with whom she spoke , she brought to the silence and told her that her anger , her sense of un@@ righteousness in the world , would only bring them into trouble .
of nothing inspired and something that had given meaning to its anger , it was a main target for the instrument@@ alization by extremis@@ ts that promised a solution .
this Ima@@ m gave the connection to God and her church again .
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , she kept her to join the IS .
it was an insight , how the Islam@@ ophobia lead me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect anyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually showing several neuro@@ scientific studies -- saying , If we fear , pass at least three things .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian governance system , con@@ formance and prejudices .
one study reveals : if one has informed F news , in which negative about Muslims , they vote rather military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look when the mood against Muslims came down -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terror attacks .
it happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two election periods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Islam@@ ophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem terror as I expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there can actually be a tool to manipulation the public to be the foundation of a free society - the rational and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the handling of the Muslims is an early &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sign @-@ sign &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear makes us all .
in the instruction of collective vir@@ gin@@ ity , it is not just about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple that lived in M@@ ays Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was on the dental faculty , talented , much promise ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , gr@@ in man whom she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his way of life . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when was such an accomplished young man from my frat@@ ernity ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ zanne in her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Craig Stephen Hi@@ cks , she was murdered , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ or who was visiting the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as in a execution , after he had post@@ pon@@ ement against Muslims on his fac@@ ebook @-@ page .
he was eight times in De@@ ak@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only mor@@ ally , but also fatal .
thus back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or we were safe at home ?
we took advantage of it and for us it was no easy decision , for it was about which America would like to leave our children , one that would control us through fear , or anyone in which we can exercise our religion freely .
we decided to do the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat we drove to the mosque , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , and looked out my shoes , went to the prayer hall , and what I saw , letting me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , than@@ ked them and welcomed our guests , for half of the gathered together were Christians , Jews , Buddh@@ ists , athe@@ ists , believers and non @-@ believers who were not to interfere with us , but to assist us .
at this moment I am squee@@ zed .
these people were there because they have had courage and sympathy with panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you go on number sure ?
or will you join those that mean : we are better than that .
many thanks .
thanks lovely !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say to those who might say that you &apos;re holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a den@@ ig@@ in with deep drau@@ ght , thus an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , do not fool you . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is permitted .
looking at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the most experienced study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity to the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am no exception to this in any respect .
when people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for cra@@ fting , is about to become a billion business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial threats . possible , this can be done in research institutions around the world .
before air par@@ c@@ els into our social consciousness , a autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre was built live in France in front of the audience a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago she began to fly with rop@@ es .
combined with str@@ apping , air@@ dres@@ sers brings high speed and acceleration at the nar@@ ro@@ ar space .
you can also build on self @-@ wearing lo@@ ad@@ able structures .
they learned to carry loads , interfere with tur@@ bo and generally respond to natural laws .
today we would like to present you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it needs to know collective where in space the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynam@@ ical tasks .
for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a member of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine position in the room , to determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
external commands are available on the highest layer . for example , start &quot; start &quot; and &quot; wind . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter ,
a plane , which tries to beat two flies with a fla@@ p .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in the down@@ ward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most of the starter lights , it can float , and thus has large advantages in the start and landing , and is highly versatile .
however , there is always a downside .
a restriction of mer@@ cury is that it will react in@@ sensitive to turbul@@ ence as wind @-@ bows .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the air conditioning doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often represent fundamental abstract questions that lead to the core of the matter .
one such issue would be for example : what is the petty @-@ potential toll of controlled parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known about as machines with a thousand movable parts , which re@@ amal@@ gam@@ ate to hurt you .
decades ago trained pilot @-@ controlled air@@ dres@@ sers were able to fly , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a H@@ eck@@ ru@@ der .
recently , we discovered that flies with only one works .
this is the mon@@ e@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically remote @-@ used flight device . it was invented recently .
it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no c@@ apping , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ator or controllers , only a prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , it happens very much in the inner life , so that it can fly stable and move in space .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the H@@ eck@@ stick . to bring it to the fly I must throw it exactly right .
the chance to throw it exactly properly when I see all , is low , therefore I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
when the bu@@ d is a exercise in con@@ gru@@ ence , this machine is here , the om@@ anc@@ é with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
you see that it is not yet symm@@ etrical .
therefore it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
thus it will get the au@@ sp@@ icious ability ,
moving in the room in all directions , no matter which direction it is filmed or even as it rotating .
naturally it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some is adjustable in models , the rest is learned directly at the fly .
let &apos;s see that on .
when flying machines are once part of our daily life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this is spinning in clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
when you build them , they act like a high @-@ performance square quad@@ cop@@ ter .
if something goes wrong -- one engine or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can continue to fly the machine if restricted .
we will now demonstrate that by making a half way off .
the last demonstration was examined synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomy , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took the commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alized technologies and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . that &apos;s why there is no limit .
hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine is standing there on Broadway becomes a flying lamp@@ shade .
of course , it is difficult to pre@@ dict the influence of this technology .
for types such as us , wage work lies in the development and creation of the work .
it serves as a memory , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it permits creative , clever creatures allowing them to shape over a spectacular manner .
the fact that this technology has such massive growth and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
1,3 billion years ago , in a very far distant galaxy , two black holes are becoming increasingly faster , they turned the mass of three others in a tenth of a second in pure energy around .
this short moment , they lit bri@@ ghter than all the stars along in all galax@@ ies of the whole known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not set their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was released into space @-@ time frame itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we first arrange the events in time .
3 billion years ago , multi @-@ zel@@ liges has been founded on Earth .
since then , the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sau@@ ces , men and -- God is standing by us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group decided to develop especially courageous -- R@@ ai We@@ iss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- to build a huge laser det@@ ector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which are about due to col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them stopped them crazy .
but enough humans recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses so the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work , they developed the det@@ ector of LIG@@ HT : the laser @-@ interfer@@ om@@ etry and gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves @-@ observatory .
in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of lightweight could substantially increased what the recognition performance improved tremend@@ ously .
therefore you now call him Advanced Light .
at the beginning of September 2015 , LIG@@ o was started for a final test run to clarify some small , stub@@ born problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes through the earth are through .
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : two moments in my life were emotional as this :
the birth of my daughter
and the departure of my death @-@ sick father .
basically they were the fruits of my life .
all this what I had worked for is no longer Science F@@ ic@@ tion ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been investig@@ ating the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves for 23 years and their due to observ@@ atories like LIG@@ O measurable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cro@@ usal in the fabric of space and time .
by passing the wave , the space and its whole content are stretched into a direction and distor@@ ted to the other .
for illustration , lec@@ tur@@ ers in courses on the Rel@@ ativity @-@ theory often lead to a really faul@@ ty dance .
&quot; stretching and shr@@ ink , stretch and shr@@ ink . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridiculous .
on 14 September , for example , everyone was stretched in the waves at the time of the waves and stolen it to the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average human being was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . Dar@@ um explained the LIG@@ O staff for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometre long laser det@@ ector , and this is absurd , this length would have to be measured with less than a thou@@ sand@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucleus . this is gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classical text on gravity
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of LIG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are tremendous .
but physi@@ c@@ ists are resour@@ ce@@ ful and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to LIG@@ O . Scott maintains that LIG@@ O is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial lifts , the size of your cell@@ phones .
this is quite practical , because you can create an image or a map of things by putting the light around you from multiple points coming around you .
with pots this is different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot of things to you :
the face of your child about .
instead we listen to certain properties such as sound and temperature , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , just Alice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob put her down . &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for LIG@@ O are the measured frequencies in audi@@ ble .
so when we convert wav@@ el@@ pattern in cord , we can speak the all literally .
the grav@@ itation on listening , can tell us about a lot about the collision of two black holes , so my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time .
S@@ H : two black , not three holes , it is simple : w@@ up@@ p !
rot@@ ate the two bodies very fast , one stops the same circul@@ atory with an additional ton@@ ing change . that sounds like that : Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu X@@ Wu
it is a kind of restra@@ int , engra@@ ined in the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date , that at least I must never forget -- heard a noise from -- S@@ H : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which are about as fast as the rods of your mix@@ ers .
AA : do we think about what this means .
two black holes , the most dense body in the universe , one with a mass of 29 sun , the other with a mass of 36 probe , revol@@ ve around one hundred times per second , before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about because we heard it .
therein lies the perman@@ ence meaning of lightweight .
LIG@@ O opens an entirely new way to investigate the universe as it never been possible before .
on this road we can hear the space and the invisible .
we can do much in space -- practical or basically - not to see .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ tive stars in super @-@ nov@@ as explo@@ de .
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the space .
the exciting physical processes occur however at the core which lies behind thousands of kilometers from iron , carbon and silic@@ on .
we will never go through , since these op@@ positions are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate iron , as if it were more transparent glass . the Big Bang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them since the Big Bang is obs@@ cured by its own ...
using the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important : I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen , which we will never see , and of which we have no idea at all . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , LIG@@ O found the right thing in the first attempt of things which we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the LIG@@ O project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that bring black holes as LIG@@ O they ob@@ serves , are the dinosau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , age @-@ old body of prehistoric times . the black holes are the sau@@ erk@@ no@@ des for our arche@@ ological work .
lightweight provides us with a completely different point of view of the events in space , the appearance of the stars and ultimately as we went out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge now consists of being as courageous as possible .
thanks to LIG@@ O , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and cir@@ cus of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than to listen to the Big Bang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
a while ago I tried an experiment .
for one year I would say to all &quot; Yes ! &quot; in front of which I feared .
regardless of whether I made myself nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I urged me to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
wanted to speak in public ?
no , but yes !
wanted to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
wanted to start playing with the swing ?
no , no , no , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I feared , I removed my fear .
my fear to keep talking , my social anxiety -- Pu@@ ff , away .
the power of one word is impressive .
&quot; yes , my life has changed .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes , my life deeply changed , on an un@@ expec@@ tedly . it started with a question of my youngest .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls all &quot; estim@@ able reasons . &quot;
as if she had a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; estim@@ able , I need milk for my beak @-@ asse . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new attitude in my family . from that time I swe@@ ar myself to play with them whenever you call me up . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- each and every single time .
fast . I am not perfect , but I am very angry .
it has a magical effect on me , to my children , to our family .
but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : first of all , I actually realised that the &quot; Y@@ ES &quot; Sa@@ gen had saved my career with my children .
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think things out , we@@ aving to life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I Cre@@ ate TV . I do more than television .
I do TV , in grand style .
in this TV season I am responsible for adding 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours TV . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television program can lie between three and six million dollars .
we say 5 .
a new episode every nine days a four shows , so every nine days twenty million dollars TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three episodes : 24 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my television series will run out on Thursday evening .
over the world my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV shows are shows , which I created myself , and not only produces , so still ob@@ scure . I have to find time , really sti@@ lled , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire that burn around the world .
do you know who still makes ?
no , that &apos;s why I am a Titan .
dream job .
I would not like to impress you with this .
I say it because I know what you think , if the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you so that all of you who &apos;re working so hard to take a business or a classroom , take a shop or a household , so you can understand that I &apos;m not just playing around the computer and imagin@@ ative , and it is true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not going to dream during a dream job .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am deep@@ ened in the work there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country from nothing .
it &apos;s like when I made troops as m@@ old I got on a canvas .
so as dre@@ aming one has a high tone , a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and maternal , cruel and rational , and the best thing is the money .
there is such a change in me when the work is fine .
a buzz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the tot@@ als sounds like a animated street , I could go for ever on her .
many people take note when I &apos;m reading the buzz that I am writing to writing that writing me pleasure .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does it .
but the money -- when I began working with the TV production , when I began working and work , building , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this sums , this energy . the money !
the money is more than writing .
the money is action and activity . the money is a drug .
the money is music . the tot@@ als is light and air .
the money is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a buzz , you cannot strive differently from the size .
the feeling of not being able to strive differently than by size , no matter what price .
this is called the sum .
or maybe it also means a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
perhaps it is called genius .
maybe it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only know that I am not made for failure , and I just know I love the buzz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just want to say to you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to put it into question .
to make a clear one : the more successful I will , the more episodes , the more higher borders , the more work there , the more things at the same time , the more I write myself , the more I write history , the more my expectations are there .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , not true ?
the land , which I created , the marathon , I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone , the sums , the money , the money .
I like this buzz . I love the buzz .
I need the money . I am the money .
am I just this money ?
and then the money stops .
revised , over@@ hau@@ led , exaggerated , burned .
the buzz has been stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mother is a single worker .
Har@@ per told people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; valuation , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da Land . &quot;
there are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
you are baby @-@ ti@@ anas .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the money heard .
the buzz of the engine eff@@ ected .
I loved my job no more . the engine was out .
the money came not back .
my buzz was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , run@@ out weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , nothing deleg@@ ating , a Titan R@@ ole not , does not exist , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no money .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show @-@ Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the buzz and the buzz was me .
so what do you do , if what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade ?
I know , some may think : &quot; H@@ ay yourself , bl@@ iss@@ ary of the author @-@ Titan . &quot;
but you know you do it , you do what you &apos;re working to be a teacher , a mother to be a mother , a mother &apos;s to be a mother , a mother &apos;s to be a mother , and knows how the money doesn &apos;t feel when the money stops , when the money stops , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern states &quot; wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; Ask a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out , late , and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I will say NO , for me to become aware of two things :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she did not call me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it calls no one more &quot; valuation . &quot;
when is this happening ?
I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and my buzz , and here everything is changing in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
we play and her sisters also come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing unusual .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in the sol@@ itude and in the absence of the sw@@ amp , I can do nothing except to adjust .
I am focused .
I am silent .
the land , which I created , the marathon , I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone - they do not exist anymore .
everything that exists is sti@@ cky fingers and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax , and the song in which it is letting go of , or whatever the girl is releasing in &quot; The I@@ k@@ gin . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so nar@@ row@@ ly that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes up and there comes in an energy boost .
and that is not right away , but it happens .
I feel it .
the money comes slowly back .
no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the money , but a buzz .
and now I feel like I would know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the cause .
it is love . that is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the buzz , the working environment , the tit@@ anium dioxide , this is just the replacement .
if I ask you , who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I get po@@ unded by using shows and TV hours and how to function my brain , then I forgot what the real money is .
the money is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the pleasure .
the real money is dependent upon the love .
the tot@@ als are the flow , which comes from life .
the real money is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real sums are ignored the pressure of history , the tasks to experience , the expectation and pressure .
the real money is simple and original .
the real money is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps fle@@ eting God the wrong words , for which God told me I am a Titan ?
it is simply Love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child will play with me , I will say Yes .
I &apos;m doing this as a rule , so I can free myself from a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic from any guilt .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice unless I want to hear the money again .
I wish it would be so simple . I am not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
games don &apos;t play to me how to work .
the truth is hur@@ ting ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer working at work than at home .
this entry is painful , because what kind of man is working rather than to be home ?
well , I .
honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
we run around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we sh@@ atter@@ ing soap col@@ bub@@ bles .
at the same time , I feel mainly sti@@ ff , absent and confused .
I am always looking for my mobile phone .
yet it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the buzz of the universe met me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped with the games ?
you can also ! let &apos;s say yes , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you keep me for na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ light .
well you are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you also know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is just 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most about 15 minutes , giving them funny that they want to do something else .
there are wonderful 15 minutes but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes I replaces a Mari@@ ja or Ke@@ ks .
and speak my te@@ ens for daughter all 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
it is just 15 minutes , more needs it not .
everybody can bring about 15 minutes in a piece , even in a bad mood day !
15 minutes on piece !
no mobile , no laundry , no distr@@ action .
the day is short : dinner , the children are praying .
but 15 minutes are possible !
my children are my well @-@ sensitivity , my world . it does not have to be children . it is necessary to feel the sums you have to have a place for his soul peace .
it is not about playing with the own children . it is about joy ,
about the &quot; Games &quot; in general .
allow yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out it and keep it out .
I am not perfect in it . I failed and I victories . friends meet , books read , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training when I wanted to exc@@ el myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a piece , why not treat a full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the money came back in my free time . the money then appears to return if I &apos;m not working .
working does not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months there will be a door , the energy flow in and I find myself in my office . I hear a well @-@ known melody , it fills me and my soul . she guides me to new ideas . I use it into full and love my work again .
I like the buzz , but I do not love it .
I do not need it .
I am not the money , the money is not me ... no more .
soap col@@ ates and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends .
this is now my money .
the buzz of Life .
the buzz of love .
the buzz of the work is part of me , but just one part . and for that I am so grateful .
I &apos;ve been sent to me that I &apos;m a Titan , I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and to play more .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my bon@@ fire still burn .
the more I play , the happier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as good mother .
the more I play , the more clear my head .
the more I play , the better I am working .
the more I play , the more I hear the buzz . the land , which I created , the marathon that I run , the high tone , the tot@@ als , the money , the money , the money , the money , the money .
the more I feel this buzz , the more this unusual , hum@@ id , naked , and new feeling of life in me is wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel the buzz , the more I know who I am .
I am writing . I think things out , I awake you to life .
this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dre@@ am@@ job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more to play . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thanks lovely .
I am Neuro@@ surgery .
like most of my colleagues I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a serious stroke , or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ surgeon it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low capacity for self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury of the central nervous system , the patients often have a permanent , heavy disability .
this is probably the reason why I was in function of functional neuro@@ surgical treatment .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve nerve functions through various surgical procedures .
certainly they have heard of one of the most known , the &quot; low @-@ brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , one has an electro@@ de deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons so that the neurological function is improved .
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease that suffered from severe tre@@ mb@@ ling and severe pain .
however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ cure .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the recovery of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was Chief atri@@ cian and worked in the emergency room day and night .
often I spent patients with sk@@ ull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they must imagine that at sk@@ ull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ mas , the brain @-@ floating , and the sk@@ ull @-@ thread increases .
to save life , you have to l@@ essen the sk@@ ull pressure .
but sometimes one has to remove a part of ben@@ evol@@ ent brain mass .
instead of throwing the bra@@ ined brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to leave cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
let cells grow from a tissue march , comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
one must find the proper diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to flour@@ ish .
this was exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts there was Jean @-@ François .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , that are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
perhaps you still know from the bi@@ ologi@@ a lesson that stem cells are un@@ mature cells , which can turn into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , little neck of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain these types of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they slowly divided and after a few weeks they even died .
thus we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but it beha@@ ved differently .
we needed long to understand where they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our big hir@@ wal@@ nut cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us , they provide for the ton@@ ing of the brain .
but why are they supposed to get us ?
we don &apos;t know this .
we believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain , as we find it in higher concentrations , close to brain injuries .
this is not so safe .
one thing is clear , however , from these cells we got our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source , which enables brain healing .
this was what we had to prove .
so , we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ language range and then cultivate the cells exactly as it was Jean @-@ François
and they subsequently highlight color to keep track of them in the brain .
in the last step we im@@ planted them at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the same individual . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we call the autonomous transp@@ l@@ ant - Aut@@ otran@@ smit@@ ant .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we re@@ implant these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we reproduce the same cells in bra@@ in@@ ous brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we re@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after some weeks they disappeared completely disappeared as if they were taken back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we caused an injury to and repe@@ aled the same cells , and now the cells remained preserved -- they grow up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were re@@ im@@ planted .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells we color in vit@@ ro , in the culture .
here we could not stop .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we orda@@ ined monkeys with a manual skill task .
you had to take feed pel@@ lets from a tray .
they did so very well .
when they had achieved a stable overall level of skill , we recorded in motor@@ ic cor@@ tex the gri@@ lling section .
ther@@ eu@@ pon the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand .
just as it would happen to people , they recovered spontaneously , to some extent , as after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to rec@@ u@@ per@@ ate with the help of sculp@@ tural in@@ doctr@@ ines . they are reco@@ vering to a certain degree , just as the monkeys .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you see the monkey , who recovered spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now look , when we im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the im@@ plantation .
I can tell you that were also for us very exciting results .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can both free@@ ze and use later .
we can use them in other neuro@@ path@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ pl@@ ate them with humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon how human brain gives the means to heal itself .
many thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I am sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what are the greatest obstacles before you start clinical trials in human beings .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the greatest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these amazing results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms in order to undergo this kind of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a very professional team .
BG : have a look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look forward to the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : it is difficult to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will we allow the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to do this study with a small group of patients .
it has been a long time to select patients to perform treatments and evaluate if it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply it to a multi @-@ centric study .
you must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment each .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting us and that you have told us about it .
BG : many thanks .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to look at it as natural .
we do not see democracy as the broken plant , which it is in reality , but as a invent@@ ories of our society .
we tend to consider them as un@@ changing conditions .
we believe that capitalism will inevitably lead to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great after@@ math in Beijing have doub@@ t@@ lessly proved that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely non @-@ democratic .
indeed , democracy stands in us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- made it clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group - our choices -- not to influence the savings programs implemented in Greece .
at this moment I thought there would be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends who told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if anything would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce an economic model for genuine democracy .
I ask you to believe again , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of an error , we could save us the democracy but that we need a true and defen@@ cel@@ ess democracy .
for without democracy , our societies are en@@ visi@@ oned , our future ble@@ ak and our great , new technologies wasted .
regarding the subject of wast@@ ing , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction in which our economies are at risk .
I call it the &quot; twin &quot; paradox . &quot;
one top is known to you . you know and recognize it as the forgiveness of debt that casts its long shadow over the U.S. , Europe and the whole world .
we all know the debt @-@ mountain ,
yet only a few recognize its Di@@ dy@@ mus .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , that is , however , is too scar@@ ed to invest it there , where it would be productive and income , with which you can reduce the debt recovery and also produce all the things that mankind is urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months , 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion invested in the U.S. , in England and in the euro area , 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion invested in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , streets , sports , equipment , and so on and so forth .
3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sounds after a lot of money , until one compar@@ es it with the 5,@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time stood around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to do except the stock exchanges and the real estate fees high .
thus debt and un@@ productive capital are the twin tw@@ ins that are not vers@@ had@@ owed by the usual market mechanisms .
the result are stag@@ nating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year old in the US , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low demand that fear the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which could not invest in . just like O@@ edi@@ pus Father , who is from fear , the prophecy of the o@@ car@@ dium could be true that his son would kill him if he will grow ,
invol@@ un@@ tary the circumstances leading , which cause O@@ edi@@ pus k@@ ills him .
this is my ha@@ unt with capitalism --
its extremely outra@@ geous art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents , and to finance especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for saving the Earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
I think . but before we continue : what do we understand by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ eles defined democracy as the social form in which the Free and the poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy of course closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be an error to make the significance of the ath@@ om@@ ic democracy due to these out@@ puts .
the decision for the ath@@ om@@ ic democracy was and is that it gave the working poor , and not only the right to freedom of speech , but more important and more important , which they grant them the right to political co @-@ operation with equal voting rights in questions of state level .
emp@@ athetic democracy has not held long --
like a candle , which shines very light , it is also quickly expanded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , our current liberal democracies have no roots in the ancient Athens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers .
liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process has been im@@ ited to politics , while the economy -- the world of corporations , became a democratic free zone .
in our present democracies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two instead of taking the economy gradually inf@@ erior the policy and depri@@ ves it .
wonder why the politicians are no longer like in the past ?
it is not up to a de@@ generation of its DNA .
it is because you cannot be in government today and still do not believe in power , because the power of politics is diver@@ ted into the economy and separated the ranges .
I mentioned my ha@@ unt with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is about as a herd of predat@@ ors that sustain@@ ably nur@@ sed the animals from which it nour@@ ishes them , that they are so hungry at the end .
it is similar to the economy , which has stabil@@ ised the policy so far , that it is growing up by the self @-@ caused economic crisis . the power of corporations is increasing , political goods are increasing , the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of the corporations are frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy the higher the tw@@ ins of people , and the greater the wast@@ age of human labour @-@ power and the wealth of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we must bring the policy and the economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; retain control , just as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , of women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it didn &apos;t go well .
the teaching from the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position like in the ancient Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is one solution : to create the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ exposure to automation and robots .
the problem is , so long economy and politics are separate areas , the automation will be higher , the automation of the twin , and the social conflicts deeper , as it is , very soon , as I think -- in countries like China will come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to re@@ design the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and we must note that we are heading in a united surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that shows the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a documentary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question is thus not whether the capitalism has brought forth the technical achievements which he has brought forth , will survive --
the most interesting question is whether capitalism is similar to &quot; The Star Tre@@ k &quot; or something similar to that of society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; where machines serve man and cut their energy into the study of the Universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; A@@ gora , &quot; in long talks the meaning of life .
I think we may be optimistic .
so what do it mean , how could it look , these &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you , in a nut@@ shell , some examples .
in the area of the company : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money , while you work and in which your capital will follow you from a work@@ station to the next , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those who work in the company .
then all incomes come from capital and proceeds , and the concept of wage labor is completely obsol@@ ete .
there is no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but who do not work in it , and employees working there , but no more exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no up@@ surge .
in the realm of global political economy , please be aware that our national currencies would have a free wa@@ vering exchange rate , in a Universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest Emer@@ ging Markets &#93; in the interests of the whole of humanity .
imagine that the whole world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade winds of the respective country into a common fund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also imagine that these funds are invested in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies especially in parts of the world where investment is scarce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it &apos;s basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes in der Bret@@ ton Woods Conference was proposed in 1944 .
the problem was that it was not the technical means to realise it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have it , especially against the background of a re@@ united politics and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world that I describe you is at the same time liber@@ alization , in which they pre@@ fers individuals , and Marxist , because they have buried the separation of capital and labor in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ an@@ ically , global key@@ n@@ esi@@ o .
but above all , there is a world in which we can introduce a real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar di@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide political together .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said , Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economics is ... do we do this , technological development will generate a massive drop in overall economic demand , what Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers referred to as &quot; long @-@ term st@@ agnation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from part of the Earth to the next , as we experience it , it is not only destabil@@ ising our democracies , but also the countries whose interest in liber@@ ality democracy is low .
if this analysis is correct , Marx is quite relevant ,
just as Hay@@ ek , which is why I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and therefore I am completely wir@@ ing .
BG : actually , and now we are probably too .
Y@@ V : when you are not wir@@ ing , you do not think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said this . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday evening dinner at the speakers have you very clear what you think about the view of the West in China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democracies we have the semb@@ lance of a democracy .
as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of the people play , -- the area of economy -- is a democratic free zone .
in a certain sense , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resembles that of the England of the 19th century .
because -- remember -- we tend to unite liber@@ alism with democracy -- that &apos;s a mistake , historically considered .
Liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stuart Mill --
he was particularly skep@@ tical of what the democratic development concerns .
what we can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done themselves in the 19th century , arrogan@@ tly smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that lots of list@@ eners were curious about your experiences as the Greek finance minister in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I knew that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half @-@ year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start with the Eurozone a new beginning ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely , to say goodbye to self @-@ suffici@@ ency , and the continuous denial that a massive ret@@ ali@@ ation line ran through the Eurozone , and continues to be a massive threat to the development of the whole of the European Union .
we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- that by the way , the first proposal was , who revealed this denial --
to do it properly . unfortunately , the forces within the eurozone , within the Europe @-@ group , have still elected the denial .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to obtain an economic system that is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , it will be able to delay it for a while , but when change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt and destructive .
BG : what change are you looking ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seriousness ...
if there is a finance minister or anyone who gives office in office after 6 months , especially in such an tense situation , he made no mistake , then that &apos;s a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the greatest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they merely wanted to bring our government , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the inv@@ ari@@ ce that passed through the Eurozone .
they did not want to conce@@ de that they have been a cat@@ ac@@ lys@@ mic program in Greece for the past five years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Troika of don@@ ors who imposed on these policies , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a collective mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of conversations , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone in front comes from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the eurozone is not survived .
for if they do not survive , the ring@@ ed fli@@ ers will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not be disastrous for Europe &apos;s catastrop@@ hic consequences , but for the entire world economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we make ourselves the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , that it appears to me , it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you very much for you to be in TED .
Y@@ V : thanks .
of Roy Price , most still never heard , although he is likely to be responsible for 22 intermediate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a leading provider at Amazon Studios ,
the TV @-@ production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has a cor@@ n@@ um and describes on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and the content to the Amazon .
naturally this is a very hard @-@ fighting sector .
there are already so many TV series that Roy did not select any one .
he must find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are on the right side of this bend .
this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ D@@ b website . the rating shows from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review received .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; Bre@@ aking bath , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where , after watching a season , your brain is asking : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; that should tell you enough what is going on at that end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price does not care to get on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence , to be &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the mean explo@@ iting , the average TV -- shows , who are neither good nor bad , simply do not delight them .
so he has to make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is there , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing something , therefore Roy Price does not want to risk .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows , and choosing eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents them online , where they can watch everyone for free .
and if Amazon signs something out there , is it possible to attack correctly ?
millions of viewers look at these episodes .
however , they don &apos;t know they will be observed while looking at these shows .
they are observed by Roy and his team who are recording everything .
you capture , when you start the show when you p@@ aus@@ ed what parts you ski@@ ps or have to look again .
they collect millions of data to decide with these data , which show they should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process it and from it results in response , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com on four republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good .
there is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of that curve 7.@@ 4 amounts and Alpha House is lan@@ det at 7.5 -- something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about at the same time at another company another manager put a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design by Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it but he makes it a little different .
instead of holding a competition , he and his team have looked at the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews that they give the shows , their course , what shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these small details about the audience : what shows them like , which manufacturers they like .
when they had all the parts together , they went a wagon and decided to do not make a Sit@@ com on four sen@@ ators , but to make a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has got hit a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 review on this bend , meaning exactly where they wanted .
of course the question is : what has happened here ?
you have two very competitive , data vers@@ ed firms .
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because the logic somehow states that all should work with everything .
when you collect millions of data for a decision you meet , then you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
one optimized it through very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work , then this is something frigh@@ tening , because we live at a time in which we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company multi @-@ health system ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one comes in touch with this software ever in touch with this software . come in touch , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison in the United States and ask for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a discharge is made or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results produced . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data failed companies are wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes does mistakes .
2009 Google announced that they can pre@@ tend through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way , pre@@ dict -- through data analysis of the Google research .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year round year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work out ,
and no one could say why .
it just didn &apos;t work , it was a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data failed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these mistakes stream data up@@ ends in decisions of life -- in the workplace , in legal arrangement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure data is helpful .
also I know lots of trouble with data . I &apos;m working in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very wise men can use ma@@ gin@@ able many data to make serious decisions as to make the decision for a cancer therapy
or developing a medication . over the years I have identified some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be circul@@ ated .
should you ever solve a complex problem , do basically do two things :
as a first , you dis@@ miss this problem into its parts , so that you can analyze the items ; as a divi@@ ding you put the items together again to a resolution .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to set the parts back together and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something for which the brain is good , it &apos;s parts and pieces to sit down again , even if the information is incomplete , so that it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful , because they used data and intelligence , where they also belong in the process .
they use the data to better understand their audience , what else they would not have been able to do , but the decision on how to put all of these parts , and make out of it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; which was not in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this show , which meant that they went a great personal risk with that decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they chose &apos; TV ideas &apos; , then when they chose &apos; Alpha House &apos; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they say the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data is just a tool , and to not forget that , this device is pretty useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball , &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions with a yes or no question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly likely , &quot; exactly here at this moment .
I will be ready to skir@@ t it later with a newspaper demo .
so far I made some decisions in my life , with whom I should have heard on the ball .
however , as you know of course , if you &apos;ve made the data available , you would like to replace it through something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so perhaps the ball is smar@@ ter and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I feel this as a very up@@ lifting message that , in spite of the great amount of data , it is still paying off , taking decisions to be an expert in what you do , and to take risks .
in the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you hit at the right end of the curve .
thanks lovely .
