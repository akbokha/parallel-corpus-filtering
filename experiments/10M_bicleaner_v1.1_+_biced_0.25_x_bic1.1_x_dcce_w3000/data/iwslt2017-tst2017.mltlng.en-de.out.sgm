<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him, because he won the Pulitzer Prize in New York Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone heard about Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which it was spectacular, that the NSA infringes illegally from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should make a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence intervention, where the CIA literally delivered drafts for an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an unbelievable story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapters did not coincide?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For nearly 10 years, the government has established against benign and urged him to name its alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this move he became a symbol of the pattern of the government, whistleblowers condemns and reporters to be spined.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the first constitutional record, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right, if media does not get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the mud that they disclose.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thus, when the government with Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters had already done before him: he refused, and said that he would prefer to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen therefore lived with the risk to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">Yet then, just days before the process, something happens.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, though they have spent years of information, that it would be crucial in their case the demands of the government on crats were dropped.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time electronic monitoring the reporters and sources are getting less and less hidden.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "rather than fail and bring crats to the statements, it could also get his digital footprints for him." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators have kept secret, without his consent, his phone references.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like its e-mail data, financial and banking information, its lending, and even traveling-links with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn for Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA istleblowers and Risens.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect his attack, whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments together.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too much dependent on its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of having a whistleblowers turned into a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press work on the game, which is to be safeguarded by the first constitutional claim, because the government has more and more possibilities to piate all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology of the government allows to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can take the moment in which they contact, instead of entering in the afterward.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software that still didn't give when it had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is Securedrop, an open-source transmitter system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the advent of Aaron Swartz, and today is from the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I work, developed further.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, like any ordinary mail.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will be encrypted and stored on a server where only the relevant message agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot procure more information secretly, and many of the information it would be requested would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is but a small part of the whole, to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are constantly developing new espionage technologies that are jeopardizing us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it is important to us to make sure that not only technology transfer to Edward Snowden have a way to do misdeeds. it is just as important as we protect the next whistleblowers." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The lack of problems in the supply of soldiers and who knows of crowded hospitals. or the next environmental laborer who strikes the alarm to the contaminated water of Flint. or a wall street, which warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">Nevertheless, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crime but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the largest data leak of history was published.] [the] Panama Papers "[the] Panama Papers" [...] [what does it mean?] [we bate Robert Palmer from Global Witness by an explanation.] this week we were sent by messages about a leak of 11 million documents of the law office of Mosca Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies such as Moselle Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set it up?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that a Ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad's postage firms in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russia's President Vladimir Putin, through a close friend of children's days, a famous cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others who are waiting to wait for the next release, and to the next exposed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the Plot of an agency's representative or John-Grisham's wife.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems cries away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens, not all of their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organisation, global Witness, these revelations have been phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by some of them to hide and concede their assets -- something that we have for ten years discuss and disclose.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people will be very confusing this whole world and it is difficult to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matrjoschkapulip.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to truly understand who is behind these growths.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on the matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there has hitherto been no prominent Americans who in these revelations, this scandal occurred.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans to hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But the principle according to which these tax havens work, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we would have a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples to see the connections in the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some U.S. states you need less information, to provide less information to found a company as to get a reference ID.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school-districts to gamble in school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has permitted scams to gamble particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covered inquiries to the offices of 13 Anwaltsfirms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigators turned out to be African ministers, who wanted to bring suspicious money to the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked that all up to a lawyer made our investigators suggestions as he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all pre-meetings. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course, nobody has been handed over to anyone, but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer, who submitted some suggestions to our secret investigations.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single top political, implicit in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And in order to cope with this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to aggravate this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very intimately, as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing has ever changed, as if it is always the rich and the powerful ones.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a dependable optimist I quite see that a lot has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">During the last few years we have seen prefers more transparency regarding what the owners of companies are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic gained political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU is based in central registers at the national level, who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both parliamentarians, but it is not the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the U.S. and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headlamps.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need executives in the economy, who stand up and say:" "" "Intransparent is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and apply this kind of transparency through laws this kind of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finish the intransparent, which now allows this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering, finally finish.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I had once almost abducted and have landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after having completed my design study, I made a back-sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda remained standing and looked at my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made a road trip all the country. afterwards, he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he excitedly told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where sleeps you tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse, "I do not know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who knows the situation not?</seg>
<seg id="108">Will I now have to offer a sleeping place?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to peace, but I don't know if he really is planning. I don't want to wind up in the trunk of a Mazda!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small piece of luggage!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard me saying," "" "I have a air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "said one voice in my head:" "" "uh, how to ask?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I stumbled to the blanket and thought: "Oh man! what I got into it?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild-estranch in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of the bed, hanging on the tips of the door, and closed my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork that he had bought from me depends in its classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Maybe the people who were sold to me as a stranger, really friends, who were just waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accommodate people on my air mattress, was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress up.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate gets out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all the hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create, fear in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky: "Brian, I laid down how we could earn something about it. our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers are staying with us sleeping, WiFi and a desk, including a mattress and each morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a site and founded so "air mattresses and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on air mattress at wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham-Omeletts tasted completely different, because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we finished our last guest and the door in the castle fell, rting Brian and I sat down.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came into the roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if one could make this business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented ourselves to the investors: "we would like to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors you are included when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite other foreign people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "this will be the next big thing!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody, who is still quite solace, would invest in a business, the strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all have learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">When you have a problem, you go to the things that one can do well. we have been able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create trust through design, between people who never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with Design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taway, which degree confidence we put together.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your Comfortzone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unnecked cell phone to your left side.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quietly alignment of panic that you can now feel -- -- is exactly what you feel when opening the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your text, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked cell of a stranger in their hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">The majority feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So also most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only times, who actually has Al Gores mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you preach on Twitter that he is candited to the President of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbour would have imagined only once with his name; if he would have told what he comes from, how his dog or her children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you could have 150 Bejudgements that all say: "he can really very well discouraging mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-known feedback system increases trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have done some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to release negative evaluations.</seg>
<seg id="175">Ultimately we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had submitted their evaluations before we made it online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We carried out a study with Stanford. we examined how probable it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are about age and dwelling.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprise we trust the people most, most of us are most similar.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social predjudice.</seg>
<seg id="181">Thrilling is when you add the call of a person -- in our case through judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">When you have less than three evaluations, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But one has more than ten, it changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation is similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">Furthermore, we learned that confidence is dependent on how much you need from them.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first news of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If one tells too little how for example "hi!" you do not get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">You are told a lot, as for example: "I have problems with my mother," -- -- the request is rather not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal level of openness, such as "unbelievable works of art in your home! I make my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct quantity of text. we also give tips on what subjects to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on hoping that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need that has not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is running very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are times even if not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have unallowed parties to have celebrated or dwelled.</seg>
<seg id="203">Host have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">In the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service. all phone calls directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls, it hurts, if I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the callers, was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, the 123 million found a problem only a fraction per cent.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">When confidence works, it can create curiosities.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host takes him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation.</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers, who tend to sleep because of sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are a real guardian angel who can save life even though they don't know properly.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you feel lonely, they bring books past.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even longer stay longer without paying the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So of course does not run every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money-transaction are exactly what one wants to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I was proud about this term for the first time, I wondered:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is here an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">But it is now simply to call "rental industry" the thing will not do justice.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade, that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People place a part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel nowadays, that is to be compared with Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place you were visited, a group there would wait to wait a thorough, and to show a bar in a bar, which one has never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">These days, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to create apartments from the ground up to the opposite side?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would it look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would have to deal with the thoughts of the common part?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow society and relationships, instead of loneliness and depreciation.</seg>
<seg id="239">South Korea's capital Seoul has already started this project. many parking spaces that the government belonged.</seg>
<seg id="240">Are now residents offered. students who were looking for a place to stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were sent to people whose children were moved. there were Incubator programs started,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share economy. our platform alone will be hosted by 785 000 people in 191 countries by a stranger, or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was there even before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has our works?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we realize that you can find the right design with the components of the trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deeply ingrained prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find that amazingly,</seg>
<seg id="251">Downwards.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to contemplate each time when a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great impact, I wonder what we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think, if you want to see me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppress, a brainwashing, or a terrorist attack?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay at the security que at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">That's how the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study revealed that 80% of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that the Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not speak to their drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I say to you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted</seg>
<seg id="271">A gagm-like-fanatics in,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual musliin.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga, because, baby, I was not born that way.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do that.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I met my decision to outreach me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I chose the Hijab to wear my headgear.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why are you oppressor yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The somber was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, namely against the pressure which I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt to a perfect and inaccessible beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, asked, asked, and believed in.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow commitment that deepened with each reading of the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm makes me sometimes a weeping thing.</seg>

<seg id="290">Then this terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>

<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>

<seg id="300">Oh, my god.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my country being attacked, but in the Nu related the deeds of others by a citizens in one suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day, we had to travel through the Middle West of the USA to start a new city and start building.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember that when we drove it -- so deep it went down into my seat, and I feared the first time to be recognized as Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment that night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations, said: "be watchful," "silk careful," "wretched in well lit areas," Versampled you not. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed in the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then Friday was in that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again the warnings: "does not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were, understandably unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people that man was holding in the outdoors and hit the outdoors.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really Brandants on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who had attacked this country, attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have refused the anger of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to have to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can actually hear people: "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we start it? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and make mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my community like from a tumor in the US.</seg>
<seg id="324">It arises only the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor removed as a whole and a benign tumor, one only keeps under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first-men and Olympiacics.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closing of mosques America make safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">It might open a few parking places but not stop terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to a people of other faith tolerant, and to show greater citizens' participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as I told a head of the police in the Washington, DC, told me: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">The radicalization process has been found that it starts online. as a result, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family, that the extremiths may be a brain-brainwashing, that believes that the person might be the true Muslims, and anyone who despises their behaviour and ideology is a traitor, or the faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to avoid radicalization, we have to stop people to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming that Islam is a non-violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a man, I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would pasted ourselves into its imagination if one recognizes it as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>

<seg id="345">It is their brutality that they can read through these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him, because she had imagined to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was just the opposite. every clergy, with whom she spoke, she brought to the silence and told her that her anger, her sense of unrighteousness in the world, would only bring them into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Of nothing inspired and something that had given meaning to its anger, it was a main target for the instrumentalization by extremists that promised a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam gave the connection to God and her church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she kept her to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">It was an insight, how the Islamophobia lead me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually showing several neuroscientific studies -- saying, If we fear, pass at least three things.</seg>

<seg id="360">One study reveals: if one has informed F news, in which negative about Muslims, they vote rather military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood against Muslims came down -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terror attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>

<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, grin man whom she knew.</seg>

<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque or we were safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We took advantage of it and for us it was no easy decision, for it was about which America would like to leave our children, one that would control us through fear, or anyone in which we can exercise our religion freely.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to do the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat we drove to the mosque, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, and looked out my shoes, went to the prayer hall, and what I saw, letting me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked them and welcomed our guests, for half of the gathered together were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who were not to interfere with us, but to assist us.</seg>

<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what do you say to those who might say that you're holding a TEDTalk, a denigin with deep draught, thus an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, do not fool you. I am completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is permitted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Looking at Muslims around the world, and I did that with the most experienced study on Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity to the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am no exception to this in any respect.</seg>
<seg id="405">When people seem like an exception to rule, then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for crafting, is about to become a billion business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial threats. possible, this can be done in research institutions around the world.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air parcels into our social consciousness, a autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre was built live in France in front of the audience a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago she began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">Combined with strapping, airdressers brings high speed and acceleration at the narroar space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build on self-wearing loadable structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They learned to carry loads, interfere with turbo and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to present you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to work autonomously, it needs to know collective where in space the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamical tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a member of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine position in the room, to determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands are available on the highest layer. for example, start "start" and "wind."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called Heckstarter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A plane, which tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in the downward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most of the starter lights, it can float, and thus has large advantages in the start and landing, and is highly versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of mercury is that it will react insensitive to turbulence as wind-bows.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that the air conditioning doesn't matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often represent fundamental abstract questions that lead to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such issue would be for example: what is the petty-potential toll of controlled parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known about as machines with a thousand movable parts, which reamalgamate to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago trained pilot-controlled airdressers were able to fly, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a Heckruder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently, we discovered that flies with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the moneinner, the mechanically remote-used flight device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No capping, hinges and cross-rudder, no further actuator or controllers, only a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, it happens very much in the inner life, so that it can fly stable and move in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the Heckstick. to bring it to the fly I must throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The chance to throw it exactly properly when I see all, is low, therefore I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the bud is a exercise in congruence, this machine is here, the omancé with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">You see that it is not yet symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thus it will get the auspicious ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in the room in all directions, no matter which direction it is filmed or even as it rotating.</seg>
<seg id="448">Naturally it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some is adjustable in models, the rest is learned directly at the fly.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that on.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are once part of our daily life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This is spinning in clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them, they act like a high-performance square quadcopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">If something goes wrong -- one engine or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can continue to fly the machine if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that by making a half way off.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration was examined synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomy, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took the commercial micro-quadcopter -- each single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equip them with localized technologies and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. that's why there is no limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine is standing there on Broadway becomes a flying lampshade.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types such as us, wage work lies in the development and creation of the work.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a memory, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it permits creative, clever creatures allowing them to shape over a spectacular manner.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive growth and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="469">1,3 billion years ago, in a very far distant galaxy, two black holes are becoming increasingly faster, they turned the mass of three others in a tenth of a second in pure energy around.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment, they lit brighter than all the stars along in all galaxies of the whole known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not set their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was released into space-time frame itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">We first arrange the events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">3 billion years ago, multi-zelliges has been founded on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, sauces, men and -- God is standing by us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group decided to develop especially courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational-waves, which are about due to colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them stopped them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough humans recognized them as crazy geniuses so the US National Science Foundation financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard work, they developed the detector of LIGHT: the laser-interferometry and gravitational-waves-observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up time, the precision of lightweight could substantially increased what the recognition performance improved tremendously.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore you now call him Advanced Light.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, LIGo was started for a final test run to clarify some small, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes through the earth are through.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: two moments in my life were emotional as this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the departure of my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this what I had worked for is no longer Science Fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been investigating the gravitational waves for 23 years and their due to observatories like LIGO measurable signals. but what are gravitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crousal in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">By passing the wave, the space and its whole content are stretched into a direction and distorted to the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustration, lecturers in courses on the Relativity-theory often lead to a really faulty dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and shrink, stretch and shrink."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On 14 September, for example, everyone was stretched in the waves at the time of the waves and stolen it to the elongation of an average human being was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. Darum explained the LIGO staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre long laser detector, and this is absurd, this length would have to be measured with less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. this is grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text on gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of LIGOs, the hunt for the waves as follows: "the technical difficulties in building such detectors are tremendous.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are resourceful and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott maintains that LIGO is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial lifts, the size of your cellphones.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because you can create an image or a map of things by putting the light around you from multiple points coming around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">With pots this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot of things to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child about.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain properties such as sound and temperature, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now, just Alice" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob put her down."</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for LIGO are the measured frequencies in audible.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wavelpattern in cord, we can speak the all literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation on listening, can tell us about a lot about the collision of two black holes, so my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not three holes, it is simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Rotate the two bodies very fast, one stops the same circulatory with an additional toning change. that sounds like that: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu XWu</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of restraint, engrained in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date, that at least I must never forget -- heard a noise from -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold sun mass, which are about as fast as the rods of your mixers.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: do we think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the most dense body in the universe, one with a mass of 29 sun, the other with a mass of 36 probe, revolve around one hundred times per second, before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanence meaning of lightweight.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO opens an entirely new way to investigate the universe as it never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this road we can hear the space and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">We can do much in space -- practical or basically - not to see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massertive stars in super-novas explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about the space.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes occur however at the core which lies behind thousands of kilometers from iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through, since these oppositions are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron, as if it were more transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them since the Big Bang is obscured by its own...</seg>
<seg id="541">Using the gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we will never see, and of which we have no idea at all. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, LIGO found the right thing in the first attempt of things which we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars that bring black holes as LIGO they observes, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, age-old body of prehistoric times. the black holes are the sauerknodes for our archeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Lightweight provides us with a completely different point of view of the events in space, the appearance of the stars and ultimately as we went out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now consists of being as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circus of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than to listen to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">A while ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">For one year I would say to all "Yes!" in front of which I feared.</seg>
<seg id="556">Regardless of whether I made myself nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I urged me to say "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Wanted to speak in public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Wanted to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Wanted to start playing with the swing?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what I feared, I removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear to keep talking, my social anxiety -- Puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of one word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes, my life has changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes, my life deeply changed, on an unexpectedly. it started with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls all "estimable reasons."</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she had a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"estimable, I need milk for my beak-asse."</seg>
<seg id="572">"" "she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude in my family. from that time I swear myself to play with them whenever you call me up. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- each and every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Fast. I am not perfect, but I am very angry.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, to my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a startling side effect: first of all, I actually realised that the "YES" Sagen had saved my career with my children.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think things out, weaving to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I Create TV. I do more than television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I do TV, in grand style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for adding 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours TV. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television program can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">We say 5.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days a four shows, so every nine days twenty million dollars TV, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three episodes: 24 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my television series will run out on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">Over the world my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV shows are shows, which I created myself, and not only produces, so still obscure. I have to find time, really stilled, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who still makes?</seg>
<seg id="598">No, that's why I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think, if the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you so that all of you who're working so hard to take a business or a classroom, take a shop or a household, so you can understand that I'm not just playing around the computer and imaginative, and it is true when I say: I understand that it's not going to dream during a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am deepened in the work there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country from nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's like when I made troops as mold I got on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">So as dreaming one has a high tone, a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and rational, and the best thing is the money.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is fine.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the totals sounds like a animated street, I could go for ever on her.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people take note when I'm reading the buzz that I am writing to writing that writing me pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the money -- when I began working with the TV production, when I began working and work, building, create and work together, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the money!</seg>
<seg id="618">The money is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The money is action and activity. the money is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The money is music. the totals is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The money is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz, you cannot strive differently from the size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being able to strive differently than by size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sum.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"" "" "" "I only know that I am not made for failure, and I just know I love the buzz." ""</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to say to you, I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to put it into question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear one: the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more higher borders, the more work there, the more things at the same time, the more I write myself, the more I write history, the more my expectations are there.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, not true?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land, which I created, the marathon, I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone, the sums, the money, the money.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the money. I am the money.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this money?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the money stops.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overhauled, exaggerated, burned.</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzz has been stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mother is a single worker.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper told people: "my mum will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "valuation, I want to go to Shonda Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are baby-tianas.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1, when the money heard.</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzz of the engine effected.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my job no more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The money came not back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, runout weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, nothing delegating, a Titan Role not, does not exist, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no money.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz was me.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do, if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade?</seg>
<seg id="665">I know, some may think: "Hay yourself, blissary of the author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you do what you're working to be a teacher, a mother to be a mother, a mother's to be a mother, a mother's to be a mother, and knows how the money doesn't feel when the money stops, when the money stops, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states" waitress "Ask a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way out, late, and she says," "" "Mama, do you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I will say NO, for me to become aware of two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she did not call me" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">It calls no one more "valuation."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I'm Titan and my buzz, and here everything is changing in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mama, do you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and her sisters also come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing unusual.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in the solitude and in the absence of the swamp, I can do nothing except to adjust.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land, which I created, the marathon, I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone - they do not exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists is sticky fingers and humid kisses, delicate voices, wax, and the song in which it is letting go of, or whatever the girl is releasing in "The Ikgin."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so narrowly that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and there comes in an energy boost.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that is not right away, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The money comes slowly back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the money, but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the cause.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The buzz, the working environment, the titanium dioxide, this is just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you, who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I get pounded by using shows and TV hours and how to function my brain, then I forgot what the real money is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The money is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real money is dependent upon the love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The totals are the flow, which comes from life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real money is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums are ignored the pressure of history, the tasks to experience, the expectation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real money is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real money is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps fleeting God the wrong words, for which God told me I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply Love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child will play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I'm doing this as a rule, so I can free myself from a workaholic from any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no choice. I have no choice unless I want to hear the money again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so simple. I am not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Games don't play to me how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth is hurting,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This entry is painful, because what kind of man is working rather than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We run around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We shattering soap colbubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">At the same time, I feel mainly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I am always looking for my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">Yet it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the buzz of the universe met me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! let's say yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you keep me for naïve, for a daylight.</seg>
<seg id="742">Well you are right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you also know why? you are not Rihanna or a muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most about 15 minutes, giving them funny that they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">There are wonderful 15 minutes but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes I replaces a Marija or Keks.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speak my teens for daughter all 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is just 15 minutes, more needs it not.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everybody can bring about 15 minutes in a piece, even in a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are praying.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are possible!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-sensitivity, my world. it does not have to be children. it is necessary to feel the sums you have to have a place for his soul peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not about playing with the own children. it is about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">About the "Games" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Allow yourself the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out it and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">I am not perfect in it. I failed and I victories. friends meet, books read, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "" "" "do you want to play?" "" "just for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training when I wanted to excel myself more and more." ""</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece, why not treat a full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The money came back in my free time. the money then appears to return if I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months there will be a door, the energy flow in and I find myself in my office. I hear a well-known melody, it fills me and my soul. she guides me to new ideas. I use it into full and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzz, but I do not love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the money, the money is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap colates and sticky finger, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is now my money.</seg>
<seg id="775">The buzz of Life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The buzz of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The buzz of the work is part of me, but just one part. and for that I am so grateful.</seg>
<seg id="778">I've been sent to me that I'm a Titan, I have never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and to play more.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my bonfire still burn.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clear my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I am working.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the buzz. the land, which I created, the marathon that I run, the high tone, the totals, the money, the money, the money, the money, the money.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, humid, naked, and new feeling of life in me is wide. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel the buzz, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am writing. I think things out, I awake you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This belongs to the job, which means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dreamjob should be a bit dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"" "I said" "" "Yes" "" "to less work and more to play." ""</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks lovely.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a serious stroke, or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeon it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low capacity for self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury of the central nervous system, the patients often have a permanent, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was in function of functional neurosurgical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve nerve functions through various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Certainly they have heard of one of the most known, the "low-brain stimulation." in doing so, one has an electrode deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of the neurons so that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease that suffered from severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-cure.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was Chief atrician and worked in the emergency room day and night.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I spent patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that at skull-Hirn-traumas, the brain-floating, and the skull-thread increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, you have to lessen the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">But sometimes one has to remove a part of benevolent brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the brained brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to leave cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Let cells grow from a tissue march, comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">One must find the proper diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to flourish.</seg>
<seg id="823">This was exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts there was Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, that are surrounded by small, unmature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the biologia lesson that stem cells are unmature cells, which can turn into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, little neck of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain these types of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They slowly divided and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">Thus we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but it behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our big hirwalnut cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus, they provide for the toning of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why are they supposed to get us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain, as we find it in higher concentrations, close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">This is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear, however, from these cells we got our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source, which enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">This was what we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">So, we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to extract a piece of brain mass from the non-language range and then cultivate the cells exactly as it was Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And they subsequently highlight color to keep track of them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we implanted them at the "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" of the same individual. "" "</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autonomous transplant - Autotransmitant.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we reimplant these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reproduce the same cells in brainous brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we replanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after some weeks they disappeared completely disappeared as if they were taken back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we caused an injury to and repealed the same cells, and now the cells remained preserved -- they grow up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells we color in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we ordained monkeys with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take feed pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did so very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had achieved a stable overall level of skill, we recorded in motoric cortex the grilling section.</seg>
<seg id="869">Thereupon the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen to people, they recovered spontaneously, to some extent, as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then they try to recuperate with the help of sculptural indoctrines. they are recovering to a certain degree, just as the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey, who recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now look, when we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the implantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also for us very exciting results.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can both freeze and use later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implate them with humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon how human brain gives the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I am sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can do that."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what are the greatest obstacles before you start clinical trials in human beings.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the greatest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these amazing results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms in order to undergo this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a very professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: have a look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to look forward to the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it is difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will we allow the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to do this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It has been a long time to select patients to perform treatments and evaluate if it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply it to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment each.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting us and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to look at it as natural.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the broken plant, which it is in reality, but as a inventories of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchanging conditions.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism will inevitably lead to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great aftermath in Beijing have doubtlessly proved that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely non-democratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">Indeed, democracy stands in us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- made it clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup - our choices -- not to influence the savings programs implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment I thought there would be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who told me that democracy would be abolished if anything would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce an economic model for genuine democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you to believe again, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of an error, we could save us the democracy but that we need a true and defenceless democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy, our societies are envisioned, our future bleak and our great, new technologies wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">Regarding the subject of wasting, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction in which our economies are at risk.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin" paradox. "</seg>
<seg id="916">One top is known to you. you know and recognize it as the forgiveness of debt that casts its long shadow over the U.S., Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all know the debt-mountain,</seg>
<seg id="918">Yet only a few recognize its Didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, that is, however, is too scared to invest it there, where it would be productive and income, with which you can reduce the debt recovery and also produce all the things that mankind is urgently needed, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion invested in the U.S., in England and in the euro area, 3.4 trillion invested in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, streets, sports, equipment, and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars sounds after a lot of money, until one compares it with the 5,1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time stood around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to do except the stock exchanges and the real estate fees high.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debt and unproductive capital are the twin twins that are not vershadowed by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result are stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year old in the US, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low demand that fear the pessimism of investors, which could not invest in. just like Oedipus Father, who is from fear, the prophecy of the ocardium could be true that his son would kill him if he will grow,</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntary the circumstances leading, which cause Oedipus kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my haunt with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its extremely outrageous art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents, and to finance especially all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for saving the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think. but before we continue: what do we understand by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the social form in which the Free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy of course closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be an error to make the significance of the athomic democracy due to these outputs.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision for the athomic democracy was and is that it gave the working poor, and not only the right to freedom of speech, but more important and more important, which they grant them the right to political co-operation with equal voting rights in questions of state level.</seg>
<seg id="935">Empathetic democracy has not held long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, which shines very light, it is also quickly expanded.</seg>
<seg id="937">"" "" "" "however, our current liberal democracies have no roots in the ancient Athens." ""</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">Liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process has been imited to politics, while the economy -- the world of corporations, became a democratic free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two instead of taking the economy gradually inferior the policy and deprives it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Wonder why the politicians are no longer like in the past?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not up to a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because you cannot be in government today and still do not believe in power, because the power of politics is diverted into the economy and separated the ranges.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my haunt with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is about as a herd of predators that sustainably nursed the animals from which it nourishes them, that they are so hungry at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy, which has stabilised the policy so far, that it is growing up by the self-caused economic crisis. the power of corporations is increasing, political goods are increasing, the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of the corporations are frightened to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism distributes the "Demos" [the people] out of democracy the higher the twins of people, and the greater the wastage of human labour-power and the wealth of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we must bring the policy and the economy again, and it would be better if the "demos" retain control, just as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, of women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it didn't go well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The teaching from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position like in the ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to create the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-exposure to automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, so long economy and politics are separate areas, the automation will be higher, the automation of the twin, and the social conflicts deeper, as it is, very soon, as I think -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "" "" "we need to redesign the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and we must note that we are heading in a united surveillance hyperautocracy that shows the film" "" "matrix" "" "as a documentary." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is thus not whether the capitalism has brought forth the technical achievements which he has brought forth, will survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">The most interesting question is whether capitalism is similar to "The Star Trek" or something similar to that of society in "Star Trek," where machines serve man and cut their energy into the study of the Universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athener "Agora," in long talks the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what do it mean, how could it look, these "Star Trek" like utopia instead of the "matrix" -similar Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you, in a nutshell, some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of the company: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money, while you work and in which your capital will follow you from a workstation to the next, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those who work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all incomes come from capital and proceeds, and the concept of wage labor is completely obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="964">There is no distinction between those who belong to the companies, but who do not work in it, and employees working there, but no more exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no upsurge.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the realm of global political economy, please be aware that our national currencies would have a free wavering exchange rate, in a Universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest Emerging Markets] in the interests of the whole of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the whole world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and each government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade winds of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">"" "also imagine that these funds are invested in" "" "green" "" "technologies especially in parts of the world where investment is scarce." ""</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It's basically what John Maynard Keynes in der Bretton Woods Conference was proposed in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that it was not the technical means to realise it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"" "" "" "today we have it, especially against the background of a reunited politics and economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="972">The world that I describe you is at the same time liberalization, in which they prefers individuals, and Marxist, because they have buried the separation of capital and labor in the dustbin of history, and keynesianically, global keynesio.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, there is a world in which we can introduce a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar diystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide political together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography as a libertarian Marxist.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I have just said, Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economics is... do we do this, technological development will generate a massive drop in overall economic demand, what Larry Summers referred to as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from part of the Earth to the next, as we experience it, it is not only destabilising our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberality democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is correct, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just as Hayek, which is why I am a libertarian Marxist, and as Keynes, and therefore I am completely wiring.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are probably too.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: when you are not wiring, you do not think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said this. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday evening dinner at the speakers have you very clear what you think about the view of the West in China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the semblance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of the people play, -- the area of economy -- is a democratic free zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain sense, if I may say so provocative, China today resembles that of the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- remember -- we tend to unite liberalism with democracy -- that's a mistake, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical of what the democratic development concerns.</seg>
<seg id="998">What we can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now proposing to do what the West has done themselves in the 19th century, arrogantly smells of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that lots of listeners were curious about your experiences as the Greek finance minister in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I knew that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start with the Eurozone a new beginning,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, to say goodbye to self-sufficiency, and the continuous denial that a massive retaliation line ran through the Eurozone, and continues to be a massive threat to the development of the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal -- that by the way, the first proposal was, who revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">To do it properly. unfortunately, the forces within the eurozone, within the Europe-group, have still elected the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to obtain an economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism, it will be able to delay it for a while, but when change occurs, it happens abrupt and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change are you looking ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: have you made any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister or anyone who gives office in office after 6 months, especially in such an tense situation, he made no mistake, then that's a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the donors to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government, just because they didn't want to deal with the invarice that passed through the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to concede that they have been a cataclysmic program in Greece for the past five years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "none of the Troika of donors who imposed on these policies, says:" "" "this was a collective mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of conversations, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone in front comes from someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the eurozone is not survived.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they do not survive, the ringed fliers will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">"" "" "" "this will not be disastrous for Europe's catastrophic consequences, but for the entire world economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we make ourselves the way of a post-modern 1930, that it appears to me, it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you very much for you to be in TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thanks.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Of Roy Price, most still never heard, although he is likely to be responsible for 22 intermediate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a leading provider at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has a cornum and describes on Twitter as "movies, TV, technology, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and the content to the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Naturally this is a very hard-fighting sector.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy did not select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are on the right side of this bend.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDb website. the rating shows from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review received.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "these are shows like" Breaking bath, "" "" Game of Thrones, "" "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addictive, where, after watching a season, your brain is asking:" "" "where are there more of these episodes?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left side, here at this end, shows like" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- "" "--" that should tell you enough what is going on at that end of the curve. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not care to get on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence, to be "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the mean exploiting, the average TV -- shows, who are neither good nor bad, simply do not delight them.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he has to make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is there, and of course it's the first time that Amazon is doing something, therefore Roy Price does not want to risk.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he keeps a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows, and choosing eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents them online, where they can watch everyone for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon signs something out there, is it possible to attack correctly?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know they will be observed while looking at these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who are recording everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture, when you start the show when you paused what parts you skips or have to look again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with these data, which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process it and from it results in response, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom on four republican US senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">There is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of that curve 7.4 amounts and Alpha House is landet at 7.5 -- something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About at the same time at another company another manager put a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design by Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it but he makes it a little different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a competition, he and his team have looked at the available data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews that they give the shows, their course, what shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these small details about the audience: what shows them like, which manufacturers they like.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they went a wagon and decided to do not make a Sitcom on four senators, but to make a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has got hit a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 review on this bend, meaning exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what has happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">You have two very competitive, data versed firms.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic somehow states that all should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">When you collect millions of data for a decision you meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">One optimized it through very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, then this is something frightening, because we live at a time in which we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company multi-health system?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one comes in touch with this software ever in touch with this software. come in touch, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison in the United States and ask for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a discharge is made or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results produced. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data failed companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes does mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">2009 Google announced that they can pretend through data analysis outbreaks of flu, the bad way, predict -- through data analysis of the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year round year, until it suddenly didn't work out,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It just didn't work, it was a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data failed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these mistakes stream data upends in decisions of life -- in the workplace, in legal arrangement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">Also I know lots of trouble with data. I'm working in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very wise men can use maginable many data to make serious decisions as to make the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or developing a medication. over the years I have identified some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be circulated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Should you ever solve a complex problem, do basically do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a first, you dismiss this problem into its parts, so that you can analyze the items; as a dividing you put the items together again to a resolution.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to disassemble a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to set the parts back together and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something for which the brain is good, it's parts and pieces to sit down again, even if the information is incomplete, so that it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think Netflix was so successful, because they used data and intelligence, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use the data to better understand their audience, what else they would not have been able to do, but the decision on how to put all of these parts, and make out of it a show like "House of Cards" which was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this show, which meant that they went a great personal risk with that decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first as they chose 'TV ideas', then when they chose 'Alpha House' as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision, because they could always say:" "" "they say the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data is just a tool, and to not forget that, this device is pretty useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball," it's amazing. for decisions with a yes or no question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer. "highly likely," exactly here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will be ready to skirt it later with a newspaper demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I made some decisions in my life, with whom I should have heard on the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">However, as you know of course, if you've made the data available, you would like to replace it through something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball is smarter and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very uplifting message that, in spite of the great amount of data, it is still paying off, taking decisions to be an expert in what you do, and to take risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">In the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you hit at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks lovely.</seg>
