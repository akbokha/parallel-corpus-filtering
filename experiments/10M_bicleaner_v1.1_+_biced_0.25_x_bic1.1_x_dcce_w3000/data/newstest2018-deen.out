Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards , which change your view of the city
a Irish institution where young people are going to meet .
a greeting chapel , where now for the S @-@ Bahn Tunnel are buried .
small gar@@ den@@ ers cultivate the past cause of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories to come .
it is annoying when landing cards are not up to date .
this knows everyone who had to take an upright because the car Nav@@ i instead of a byp@@ ass street showed a green meadow .
the historic maps of the digital Bayern Atlas , an offer of the Ge@@ o @-@ Portal in the Bav@@ arian State , are anything but up to date - just so very enligh@@ tening .
especially when you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mercury in Munich since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern Atlas is a sp@@ lat@@ ency work that is not immediately visible as such .
in the large coverage map for cities and communities we receive detailed maps , so @-@ called pri@@ es@@ dat@@ ashe@@ ets .
these arose according to the Bav@@ arian surve@@ yed administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 , and escaped from the first de@@ duction of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army secretary occupied Bavaria since the spring 1800 during the Second Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ eg@@ es with Austria .
Napoleon was looking at an overview of the occupied country and was commissioned by top@@ ographic reception - of course for military purposes .
even if French troops were finally moved with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville , February 9 , 18@@ 01 : they were today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a region @-@ wide Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max I@@ V. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was further forward the project , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ mess@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ur@@ posi@@ tional blatt for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 , and is like all the others on the site of the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison earlier / today is the example of the provincial capital most impressive .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling that appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
Send@@ ling was 21 years after creation of the map , thus 1877 , as Munich part of the district .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling lies in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ man concentrate on today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , you see nothing but fields - at first glance : with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written fl@@ ot@@ ings from so @-@ called &quot; urine &quot; from which the base tax was derived .
small plots do not occupy there any farmers anymore - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the complex &quot; land in Sun . &quot;
a large green space is situated north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 ro@@ place of the October Revolution , was in the 19th century indeed a meadow - and no concrete form .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map provides an insight into the history of the psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the Ur@@ posi@@ tional blatt , in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen is not only reading the street name &quot; on Gast@@ sta@@ g &quot; or from the ascent &quot; On the air - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ strasse there are once people with madness .
there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Mün@@ chner @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; on the Au@@ er Lü@@ nen .
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden led the institution - the psychiat@@ rist , who in connection with the death of King Ludwig &apos;s II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended for example the purchase of the so @-@ called Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has forbidden the personnel forbidden to apply violence against in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Director of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen museum , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients first was first enough , later on 500 places were expanded .
sometime we have reached this capacity no more - the reason for the construction of the circular pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary in hair in 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ East , one of the biggest psychiat@@ r@@ ists in Germany since 2006 .
the real estate of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt are now meeting young people at Munich &apos;s Sal@@ es@@ an@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth @-@ home with training facility .
west is the soccer field of the TS@@ V in East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 , one taught the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; - in an architectural reference to the country of origin of the Ir@@ d district , which had been destroyed during World War II during bom@@ b@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; head office &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 56 as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Head Office &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Al@@ lies , in December 1944 , got a lot of holes in the city centre .
a big one remained to this day - Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English institute , small business buildings and a pit chapel from the Middle Ages stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof where these days are the pre@@ ten@@ ement and place on 5 April 2017 the sp@@ ade for the second S @-@ Bahn .
the old Munich @-@ map enables to compare the old Munich @-@ map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
Civil Rights , published before the Mis@@ souri
the National Association for the promotion of coloured is issued a warning for color @-@ colored people who travel to Mis@@ souri due to the discrimin@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks by the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Council for the federal state Mis@@ souri , who is to come into force up to 28 August 2017 , invites special attention to visitors and Mis@@ sovereign , as a number of frag@@ mented , r@@ ins@@ ing pre @-@ based proj@@ ections can occur in the whole state and can be noticed here , &quot; it is in the Group &apos;s opinion .
a recently adopted law of Mis@@ souri , which makes it harder to gain discrimination , as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state that are dis@@ proportionate to minorities , led the group to recover the travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; they have injury to citizens &apos; rights that people happen .
they will be arrested because of their skin colour , they are put together or killed , &quot; said the president of the Mis@@ souri NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear afflic@@ tions in such a frequency we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .
the group cited as rac@@ ist condem@@ ning against black students at the University of Mis@@ souri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ ennes@@ see .
S@@ anders died under fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no gasoline any longer during the journey and was taken into custody by the police of Mis@@ souri without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points to a recent article by Mis@@ souri in Mis@@ souri , to be shown that black motor@@ ists in the state 75 percent are more common than wh@@ ist@@ les .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and about their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ souri , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to bring both Cau@@ tion or relatives that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ souri drew up 100 hate crimes in 2015 , following the latest figures from the Spanish criminal investigation programme of the F@@ BI , which shifted the state into relation to the number of such violations in the 16th position of the country .
travel warning is also a response to a new Mis@@ souri law that would make it harder to shor@@ ten a company because of living or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the countries of immigration law adopted that local law enforcement authorities are committed to conce@@ de people due to immigration violations , which will contribute to pro@@ voc@@ ative views of the AC@@ L@@ U .
travel openings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but in recent times , stakeholders have deployed the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the US .
Wei@@ ghts project is elementary
the fishing village of Wei@@ de@@ fence @-@ Project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U @-@ Bundest@@ ags M.@@ White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac took a picture on the spot .
at the right @-@ dig@@ ging of the family Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann met representatives of the Fis@@ hell CD@@ U local network together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two lob@@ bying .
Markus Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann granted insights into his farm , in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 cows , and there are also many young animals and houses in five apartments of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este .
the &quot; Black @-@ milk &quot; is for him the alternative market @-@ proof for the milk of its cows , so Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann .
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este comes exclusively on@@ ales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as it is also BL@@ H@@ V @-@ president of Fis@@ her@@ bach , he described the Wei@@ ler project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spontaneous &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can manage on such steep areas not in a profitable way .
the green @-@ area care for a lot of work , much needed to be edited with the engine sense .
&quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann stressed .
in 2003 he took over the el@@ ter@@ ous operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fer@@ til@@ is@@ ers , even though he does not lead bio @-@ business .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Comm@@ une has recognised the meaning of the Wei@@ ler Project and is happy with the leader of the leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per h@@ ect@@ are , the farmers would have to be supported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope that the re@@ for@@ estation of surfaces nor a whole while could be moved . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the greatest treasure we have , the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their operation , &quot; stressed the Mayor .
farmers are often referred to in criticism due to funding
over the Wei@@ ghts promotion were fenced in 2013 for a total of 25 plots of eleven participants .
this open surface is about 40 hectares , which are not allowed to be hosted by at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of 71 500 euros was promoted to half by leader , a quarter carried out the municipality of Fis@@ her@@ bach .
thus , farmers love 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to get in 16.@@ 2 kilometers past@@ ure .
&quot; the great advantage is the longevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; declared Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann .
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and farmers it doesn &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter We@@ iss we stand : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here the best food is produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape of Agriculture ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg is possible for the government to promote past@@ ures .
the goal is the preservation of the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald .
prerequisite is the presence of one of the L@@ PR recorded conveyor belts .
in addition , the oc@@ cl@@ and@@ ing area may not be in@@ conclu@@ sive ( H@@ ang@@ a@@ version over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by re@@ for@@ estation .
for the Fis@@ her@@ bacher Wei@@ ghts project 2018 , the application of eight participants is running with 24 plots , which would like to build nearly 16 kilometers of fence .
the accounting surface is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing more sacred ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp is taking the Statue of Liberty
the safest sign of a regime transfer is it when they begin to att@@ acking statues .
the Americans estimate this as well as any other - therefore the careful fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ m place in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tru@@ mp regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic fee with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N about the proposals of the President to the dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to be fair , Miller did not hold the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ators had it paraly@@ sed if he had done it .
but he attacked its importance , and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to , when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus , 17 years after the completion of the monumental homage , was added to his basis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the poem you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is princip@@ ally correct , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history .
it is about the contemporary resonance to the distor@@ ted words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; your exhausted , your poor , / your depres@@ sing crowds , who y@@ earn to breathe free , / the el@@ aring waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; el@@ iling waste &quot; was better seen on our screens .
Miller was not involved in literary critic - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in the Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict : it is in fact a conflict with the importance of America .
Lazarus and her friends who put themselves in place their words for their death on the base - did very good that they have been doing a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the links between French and American re@@ public@@ anism , presenting the feminine embodiment of freedom in an un@@ used classical exposition .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice .
and she gives himself a very different name : mother of ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist Cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vism .
and exactly as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .
the great cry of Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John of the Baptist , argued for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued for the Statue of Liberty , rather an early neo @-@ conservative , which bring the American flame into the re @-@ re@@ ated world : &quot; Lady Liberty is proceeding .
she is supposed to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch is not meant to illumin@@ ate the way to the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here found on something .
the importance of the statue is entirely at all a question of the point of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus consisted in seeing them as they did from the exhausted , miserable , but hope@@ ful men after long and often terrible journeys on the Dec@@ ks of ships was seen .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue says to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear .
and of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp would ever wish to recognize .
their tor@@ ches should not light the way , but hatred , who is their only source of power .
World Championship 2017 : Neil Black F@@ lows Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two holes had belonged to the team of Great Britain .
the performance @-@ direc@@ torate of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Advisory Board has a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
black believes that &quot; Scotland developed something special in Scotland and to learn something from the world &apos;s athle@@ tics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we figure it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy on the stre@@ et@@ corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals @-@ candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5.000 m stretch , while E@@ ili@@ ie do@@ yle was elected by the crew to the team @-@ occup@@ ant .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is rather modest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were ch@@ ot@@ tish or wherever they live or train , they went out of the room and felt very proud and were highly motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ ie brought quite naturally was great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Commonwealth @-@ Silver Medal , which is competing for the 5th World Championships on the 400 @-@ m hur@@ dle , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 holes in the British team are .
Scotland &apos;s best total of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
there was five British and two European records set up in the last year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runners .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 square meters , is another Scot@@ sman that you should follow after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members its first world championship that was the only different Scot@@ sman in the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell was .
the Mann@@ ers Captain tells that they are &quot; enormous &quot; on the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots will not only belong to the team , but in some cases also with the medals and the Fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing to be to the team is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so it &apos;s a great honor anyway , but to know that my team @-@ mates have voted for me and chose me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the fle@@ ets which belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows only how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes , who want to get on po@@ ds .
as far as my speech is concerned as a captain ?
yes , I think it went well .
I have just pointed out that in this situation we are very happy as we have a home circuit .
so it is really important to put on this home support and to benefit from it , that we are at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go there and compete and it &apos;s just going to be a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
don &apos;t block critics on Facebook : ask yourself a public office if you can &apos;t wear the on@@ ating from voters
the father of our country knew something about a bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not last long until the newspapers sm@@ ote him because of all , from the internal policies to its political principles .
he p@@ lowed in the criticism , sure .
but he did not have his critics sil@@ enced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te , we will be guided by the sheep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Maryland under Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who must work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on its official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ation def@@ endant him therefore at the beginning of this week .
the stock@@ pil@@ ing of the govern@@ ors left the law@@ suit as fri@@ vo@@ l , and the on @-@ line comment was full of a bac@@ kl@@ ash against &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; many people said .
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like ho@@ gan@@ ese .
this is a Republi@@ can Gover@@ nor in an overwhel@@ m@@ ingly democratic state which is amazing .
he has the second @-@ ranking approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
ho@@ gan@@ ese is not a reactionary heat .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his ha@@ un@@ ess head following chemotherapy in his side .
therefore , the ref@@ usal of persons who come to the side of the Govern@@ ors - which is a public forum that is officially designated as official and by workers who are paid by public tax @-@ Dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post defended Ho@@ gans Spre@@ cher@@ in Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the actions of the Govern@@ ors and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moderation .
but it is too simple to use the image of tro@@ lling or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ water @-@ filled people who reson@@ ate online the ver@@ tex .
the post was talking to some of the real people blocked from Ho@@ gan .
and these are just genuine people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a pastor , not a tro@@ lls .
they all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not profound .
the priest passed the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
lawyer , Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , MD . , was not re@@ asser@@ ting , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news , &quot; wrote them in the commentary box &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position at the same time , they are considered by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what the employees of the Govern@@ ors signi@@ fied as &quot; concentrated Spam @-@ attack , &quot; would other likely call &quot; inter@@ c@@ acies . &quot;
the Facebook @-@ era makes it simple to cut a message by simply blocks a critic or deleted a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in previous times when you have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical comments , and to burn demonstrators or prot@@ esters .
but this is exactly what exactly happening now .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official who is critici@@ zed by Facebook and other social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tru@@ mp has blocked from Twitter @-@ users who were blocked from his Twitter feed on Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the first milestones on this question fell in Virginia last week .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County was the last A@@ mend@@ ment , according to the US District Court James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she called a vot@@ er from her Facebook page .
and K@@ entu@@ cky , governor Matt B@@ vin ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of its use on Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so hard .
as far as Washington &apos;s time , Washington had a similar effect on the Internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous mail @-@ drivers proposed to his leadership .
and even then , Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ me such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters of newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
peti@@ tions , which critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and navigation of Great Britain , over@@ came his ministry , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he did not have them sil@@ enced .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes on domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home convenience over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Loth@@ ar organized the 25th issue of Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , which was next year , in the Ar@@ cher@@ field left until the final round , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new scene and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; I have seen how Renaissance club was built and we see how he reached his fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty .
&quot; the players will see this course from their best , he is in a great state .
Jerry made a great job than he was at the place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous suppor@@ ter of this game and is proud of its performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he won in the European tour as well as at the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; this really feels particularly &quot; , &quot; said the player found in South@@ port .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open because it was in the year after I had won it , taken from the program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to that part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from the last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year to win here .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year to the European Senior Tour , returns to his home ground .
this event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I &apos;m glad how we have come . &quot;
with the trio at the field the former Masters @-@ winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ever .
Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six holes in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ All@@ ister , Bill Long@@ b@@ ir and Ross Dru@@ m@@ mond .
the entrance is free , the parking costs £ 5 a car with a in@@ mates and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers .
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less pneum@@ onia by hand @-@ hand smoke
in the past two decades less and fewer people have died because of passive exposure to lung cancer .
this results come at the University Clinic Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates a year 16@@ 7 L@@ lung cancer is due to passive exposure to passive exposure , &quot; said academic leader Hei@@ ko &apos;s cup .
as a comparison , he received his own study on this topic of 1994 .
back then there have been 400 lung cancer cases for passive exposure and pas@@ si@@ ties per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
im@@ parti@@ tions prove to be very complex
the construction works in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; lie somewhat in time , &quot; says the head of the Bau@@ x Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the home accounts , the situation is more complex than suspected , as in the underground is much closer , which is not noted in the plans .
the traffic that has repeatedly hin@@ dered the construction work , represents a major problem for the B@@ aut@@ rup@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of the motor@@ ists in front of red lights and barriers is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is locked and only the buses are eligible to drive .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the St@@ ump@@ p company has been working on the bridge since weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were very exhau@@ sting already . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but luckily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; said Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian Gold@@ land
if Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i cook dinner , she does not use coo@@ ker .
it even rarely used a pot .
in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai cabin in the un@@ quiet Indones@@ ian Province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually presents a sweet potato - locally as &quot; not@@ a , &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour the lon@@ ged tu@@ bers is s@@ worn with di@@ lig@@ ently , un@@ seas@@ oned hands and dev@@ oured them .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay maker - she does not have furniture - where she also performs its daily work , Z. B. Dres@@ ses with clou@@ dy water from the nearby mar@@ sh .
a bu@@ cket in a homeless space is used as a cabinet .
as youngest of the four wives of her husband you were not assigned any fields .
poly@@ gam@@ y is usually common .
of course it can be dangerous to work too : most of the st@@ ett@@ men are unemployed , and many are drinking hard and there are the soldiers .
&quot; nobody w@@ ns it , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life of the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1.@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of occupation forces .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up for independence from the interven@@ tional rule , turned quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , who owns control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal entities .
in 2003 the province was officially distributed in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua in 2003 , being comprised of the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea &apos;s eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is located just as it is o@@ de . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there is no public transport .
the city with approximately 19@@ .000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bam@@ boo and wooden roofs , which were converted by r@@ ust in various yellow @-@ brown sounds .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , because journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian missionaries arrived , hon@@ ed Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to their lively , handmade Tur@@ ban , their dark hem@@ d and her bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we only had leaves to our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indones@@ ian in Indonesia , where 28 % of men live below the poverty line and some of the worst inf@@ estation and alphabe@@ tization rates in Asia have .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and profitable gold mine in the world , grass@@ lands , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a strongh@@ olds in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3.000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has decreased in value of $ 3.3 billion in gold and copper .
moreover , Pap@@ ua has Wood@@ resources in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars .
these riches are however a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s em@@ powered military remains a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port seeks local military units and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , among them up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars in a single officers .
Pap@@ u@@ lian demands for greater autonomy are thre@@ aten this golden li@@ ans and become merc@@ il@@ essly treated .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 pe@@ ua were killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed since 1969 by the Indones@@ ian military , tor@@ tured and de@@ tained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mass kill@@ ings at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mass@@ u@@ as tribal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 1970 @-@ 1980 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; became a genocide in line with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the region alone , the Indones@@ ian police held more than 3.@@ 900 peaceful demonstrators in the past year .
&quot; we value all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a report of the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Brisbane taken from 2016 , in which reports on atrocities and torture - rape and electro@@ des are especially popular after another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s difficult to count the number of victims as each week passes , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have been reinforced because Pap@@ u@@ as resources can bring a flow of settlers in other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development changes itself because Muslim economic migrants are coming from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ning P@@ ines are sold @-@ in chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ines .
local people are fighting for it here .
&quot; the migrants began to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local pe@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ local , who moved to work in the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has tasted the native indi@@ ua - the mom @-@ Mama , the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Indones@@ ian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i , spoke during his election campaign to address inequalities and violations of law in Pap@@ ua .
the former Zimmer@@ mann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua ( including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel betrayed .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i , with the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes , that justice is restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , the Pan@@ i@@ ai exp@@ elled only two months after J@@ ok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October .
on December 7 , 2014 was a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali as two Indones@@ ian soldiers on a motorcycle by the dark .
the start@@ led children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took off her tone and later came back with four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers , the drank , had hunt and swal@@ low the group with their rif@@ le , they said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year old Yu@@ li@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so badly beaten , that he fell into a coma .
a few hours later the building of the nearby government Commission was set in fire and escal@@ ated things next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered together on a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Commander centre to demand justice .
they bore cerem@@ onial hunting ch@@ ats and led the Wa@@ ita Dance - in the circle continuously and a s@@ wan im@@ it@@ ational - of Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ trunk .
some prot@@ esters began to drag stones at police and military post .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : if the masses do more than three times , they shoot it dead , &quot; said in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released by the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ min@@ ent danger and called for tranquility and called the crowd to return home .
no one was heard in the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my lin@@ kes wr@@ ist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colorful wooden house .
Kay@@ ame still does not know who has found , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the soldiers gathered here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was taken three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the sho@@ ots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure that he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who like many Indones@@ ian only a name , the TI@@ ME in gri@@ mmer mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said repor@@ ters that his officers must &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure their station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they are attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young prot@@ esters were killed and many others were injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings came first on the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; by Jak@@ arta .
three weeks , J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and v@@ owed to tackle the historical problems of Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like this case will be resolved right away , so that in the future it will no longer happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
security minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 , that he should set an extra@@ judicial mechanism for Sett@@ lement of historical human rights violations .
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the injury occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and early 2000 @-@ s years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have ple@@ dged to address these violations , but there are processes that must be passed through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then she made a withdrawal when he spoke with TI@@ ME on June 5th in Jak@@ arta with TI@@ ME and said he did not have any plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wir@@ anto , which accused the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; said more than 1,000 cas@@ u@@ alties in East anti @-@ independence in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua were already discussed , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims with gri@@ mm@@ ers unbelie@@ ving .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was interviewed in the past three years , but there was no progress &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he is still living in fear for years .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus reiter@@ ated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought after me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indones@@ ian police on villagers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between the villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring a unconscious man to hospital , a person died and 17 others were wounded , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drunk as he was in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
extended villagers prot@@ esting from the company &apos;s sit@@ ing office .
the police said that the villagers fell upon officers , who re@@ acted to re@@ fired warm @-@ shots .
but natives say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot the crowd and killed a killing .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witness how the injured one was quickly delivered , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; I have hidden myself in my house two days . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to hold the officers to account and withdraw the mobile Brig@@ ade of the police in the field .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a sh@@ ru@@ gated board for the Indones@@ ian government .
the lack of sensible development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the Me@@ e Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ land of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) to defend the re@@ bel army , which claims to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by encounter@@ ing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and scre@@ enings of Indones@@ ian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ o@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to this , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years and put under arrest under the pretext of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security of national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some will never dive again .
among the people of Pap@@ ua the Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten town . &quot;
poverty rein@@ forces the dis@@ satisfaction .
the bit of rice , being sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of range .
the people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women to edit four or five fields of sweet potato .
they keep the bulk of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of not@@ a were only 10,000 Indones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
over time , economic inequalities between the indigenous Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown , since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire Airport in greater numbers have arrived .
the few jobs that exist in the region go generally to the better trained and wealthy migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own enterprises competitive .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the tribal Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
insulation keeps the eyes of the world far away from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , limitations of the reporting international media are tense .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ cham@@ p were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they were given rare permission to films .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the vice @-@ president of Human Rights Watch , the promises of J@@ ok@@ ow@@ is electoral campaign , the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development , is not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new risks to foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia of un@@ quiet east@@ ern@@ most provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua ( visa @-@ denial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of the pap@@ as .
in March six on@@ fish states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the mar@@ sh@@ all@@ Islands and the Sal@@ om@@ onen Islands - the UN Human Rights Council , to examine the &quot; various and widely spread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shooting .
the same countries have historically considered the O@@ PM .
the speaker of the Indones@@ ian Foreign Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ tha N@@ asi@@ r referred to the accus@@ ation of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia still holds a democratic system and there is free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights violations . &quot;
the people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of human rights ambassador Ke@@ es Van Ba@@ ar , May@@ ap@@ ura visited their silence and printed him , &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a spring which also attended the meeting , but remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua say that they probably will not vote for J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the tribal Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants , that J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it lives under the constant threat of a rob@@ ber military , finds itself in im@@ pover@@ ished educational and health services .
Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider her voice for J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; he must pay back .
&quot; you do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and intimi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ sho@@ ots resulted in a very symbolic act of the du@@ des : the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station .
they know they might never give justice to them , but at least they do not forget their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with absolute head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire grasp the &quot; Tor@@ ch &quot; skyscr@@ aper of Dubai for the second time
on Friday , a fire took place in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai his pass@@ book and forced hundreds of residents , from the 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed building .
it is the second fire that has been swe@@ pt through the high @-@ house in just two years , that they are called random the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries have not been reported , and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we have been with fire @-@ raid and the scre@@ aming of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; told a resident that tell his name as George ang@@ ab , Re@@ uters .
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building cooler .
the government said it is working on providing accommodation for those concerned .
the incident can revi@@ ve any questions concerning the safety of materials used in outside areas around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 was that the largest part of the abuse of dis@@ guise , exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or isolation .
in Britain the police , she said that the system of plates for isol@@ ating and cl@@ adding to the London Gren@@ fell tower could have contributed in June to the rapid spread of a bran@@ ce , in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup @-@ Reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis courts ( IT@@ F ) was taken at the general meeting with his large Davis Cup @-@ coup at the A@@ GM .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup sol@@ itary is not only supported on two demonstrations , Hau@@ ch@@ thin is not supported by the two @-@ third majority .
the indeed very long , but even therefore very much @-@ valued five @-@ sentence classics remain the traditional process .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of member countries voted for re@@ formation , the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore , was only scarce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our members will not have accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one will continue to work on improving the quality .
even not until the vote was , after many verses , the proposal had already reached before the final on a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively small details : so the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be in the first round the host &apos;s law in the first round .
to reduce the costs of the organizer , the requirements are facilitated in new training places etc . and players will have to complete less official media outlets before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 of 5 US travelers will find forbidden objects in the plane , find a survey
a survey conducted among passengers revealed that more than 20 percent become aware of or unconscious items to the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , who played the aircraft while they were accidentally disp@@ osed of kni@@ ves or other items with blades .
less than 1 per cent of claimed it would have been bel@@ ated that they have been shiel@@ ded with weapons , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey with more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet @-@ charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also found that younger travelers are more likely to abuse the rules .
from those surve@@ yed , the en@@ cor@@ es that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 per cent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were .
the most common items that have been inten@@ tionally un@@ inten@@ tioned to T@@ SA &apos;s agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent gave to know@@ ingly worn items with blades by safety control , while 2,@@ 2 percent of female respondents rep@@ lied and 3.@@ 7 per cent of the male respondents rep@@ lied that they could have pur@@ pos@@ ely banned drug into the aircraft .
the company said it has interviewed travelers throughout the country to find out how many accidentally s@@ mug@@ gling in s@@ mug@@ gl@@ ware produced by airport security and how many have done it inten@@ tionally .
it &apos;s no surprise that the people who were most satisfied s@@ mug@@ gling ware - know@@ ingly or un@@ know@@ ingly - through security carry , those were most often flying .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing .
people are often unsure which liquids they are allowed to take or how much of them .
it is therefore no surprise that the largest quantity of the liquids conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden .
a while ago people thought the T@@ SA could look into books as s@@ mug@@ gling ware .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la &apos;s clients cancel order
&quot; &quot; &quot; electric genius El@@ on Mus@@ k will be happy to present with the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , he so far failed to have withdrawn some of the customers their non@@ comm@@ itt@@ al reservation already withdrawn .
alongside the always triumph@@ ant figures on sales points and even more gigantic target targets , Tes@@ la leader El@@ on Mus@@ k has been given another , less gl@@ oss @-@ full number for the first time : the cancellations made at the new mass market model 3 .
Mus@@ k had often applied with the more than 500@@ ,000 pre@@ orders for the new car , whose delivery begins right .
Mus@@ k A : from the total 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre@@ orders , 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn .
critics always had pointed out that it is only a non @-@ binding reservations .
in a cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) .
currently 45@@ ,000 of these non @-@ binding reservations are currently available in a telephone conference with analysts .
that the cancellation of so far about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem , however , the Tes@@ la leader does not believe .
its argument : the challenge for ambitious growth is not the demand , but on the production page .
the Tes@@ la 8@@ 4.000 vehicles provided last year .
2018 : all models are to be put together - 500@@ ,000 , 2020 - one million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k currently are present a day 1800 reservations .
whoever orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; can already be expected in the second half of 2018 with the delivery - if Tes@@ la creates it to re @-@ establish his brand @-@ new , never in the practice of tested production lines without greater interrup@@ tions with maximum discharge .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
if there is too much delays , then the dis@@ binding of reservations should become a problem for Tes@@ la .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for then the company cannot prevent non @-@ satisfied customers in dro@@ ves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
EPA chief stim@@ ulates the rules of the Obama &apos;s rules to cut emissions back
a day after having been tam@@ pered by 15 States , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the leader of the environmental protection authority , had its previous decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions tu@@ g @-@ causing disease lubric@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented change when its agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not address the law@@ suit against his previous position in a Federal Ministry of occupation .
this is a deadline , which was going on 1 October for states to meet the standards of 2015 for bot@@ tom@@ ed ox@@ igen ( o@@ zone ) .
P@@ ru@@ itt reported in June that he would delay compliance with a year , in order to give more time to his authority to study the plan and to avoid &quot; impe@@ de &quot; in local decisions or to impe@@ de economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was in front of his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp Pro@@ secutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent for severe environmental protection regulations .
since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt repeatedly pushed to impe@@ de regulations or to delay , which chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels will resist .
the sudden conversion of Wednesday is the most recent legal withdrawal for the P@@ ru@@ gel@@ ic Roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a federal court in Washington had decided that the EPA has exceeded his authority than he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas business for monitoring and reducing meth@@ ane .
in one on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt present that his turn@@ around in O@@ zone &apos;s standards simply hit the willingness of EPA in cooperation with the states through the complex process of timely fulfilling of the new standards .
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often observed the deadlines for carrying out and then waited for being indicted by activists and others , and in an agreement to set the appointment for the execution , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained over a dozen times in his previous job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by judicial proceedings , and we take time seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that we are giving us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the EPA adopted that P@@ ru@@ itt present his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority for the delay and all other legal claims available &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to ensure that the rules &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rely on solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ can in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive re@@ tin@@ ting of o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved in the last month is intended to delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 at least eight years .
the measure was not yet made to vote in the Senate .
the New York @-@ General @-@ General Eric C@@ ens@@ man , who led the Coalition of the States , who suffered the EPA from this week , said the group intended to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turning the EPA - according to our law@@ suits - is an important asset for the health and security of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and those over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the Smo@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ dres@@ sers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

soil @-@ o@@ zone arises if pollut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil raff@@ les , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere on sunlight react .
the smo@@ g smo@@ g can cause serious injuries in sensitive groups of people , and each year will contribute to thousands of premature death cases .
representatives of the public health system and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered over P@@ ru@@ dence &apos;s course of change .
&quot; it &apos;s disturbing , how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step by the responsible for the protection of air we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government , and turn to environmental contam@@ in@@ ers and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ ors celebrates 750 years St. Hil@@ arius church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church : on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Berg@@ kirche is invited to the old cemetery A@@ real in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16 July to 16 : 30 at a Seren@@ ade .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historic town of St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Centre a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the sixth charity , can ench@@ ant themselves from this powerful place .
the rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens .
Walter Martin@@ i : &quot; it is a unique village . &quot;
in the year 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ al chapel was first mentioned in the Wur@@ ttem@@ berg Mountains . Graf Hermann of Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen , with the Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; to Mag@@ ister E@@ ber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Diet@@ rich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the wording of the certificate , standing on the Tum@@ linger Berg , except the erst@@ while parish church , also a splendid farm , belonged to the church or the Pat@@ ron@@ al Church , and not the other way around .
so there were people there .
as comes from the description of the Freu@@ den@@ heim city of 18@@ 58 , in addition to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , today still visible in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; Berg &quot; of the Third , the glori@@ fied settlements of the village .
ancient maps from the period around the year 1600 were supporting these historical circumstances .
the pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ worth was born from the early medieval her@@ bi@@ ome @-@ law .
a Lord who built a church , kn@@ itted and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church and could also bequ@@ e@@ ath this church .
associated with it was the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor .
three alt@@ ars were offered in the church and two bells on the tower .
the biggest of the two bar@@ gs at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell set then for the first time 16@@ 92 , had to be released later during the Second World War in 1942 .
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the wind@@ ow@@ es were pushed and the bells was stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops in the vicinity of the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and top @-@ chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church commen@@ ced in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius @-@ cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from hear@@ ers .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ary Church was broken down .
only the snow@@ storm was left .
in the New Year , 18@@ 34 , a storm turned the cher@@ ub@@ by storm and half the storm .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was cancelled .
only the still existing tur@@ m@@ ite remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today Horst K@@ all@@ en@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ her maintain the help of the &quot; Schaff@@ ors &quot; as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
as organis@@ ers invite the friends and sponsors of tum@@ our on Sunday , 16th July , at the sixth seren@@ ade to the old cemetery for the St. Hil@@ ary chapel .
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium ( Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with the contribution of Kurt D@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ te@@ is .
place @-@ standing Hartmut Rom@@ ann speaks the closing remarks .
the program starts at 16.@@ 30 PM .
the admission is from 15 : 30 PM .
to the end of the Seren@@ ade , a trunk takes place before the cemetery .
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with the wide view over meadows into the forest , the hosts make the fantastic view out .
the Seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organis@@ ers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance for tum@@ our and hear@@ ers .
the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens are particularly committed to the domestic care , as Seren@@ ade @-@ organizer Walter Martin@@ i .
association aims to assess the permission of wind @-@ motorcycles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim pursu@@ es itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see a legal requirement for construction and therefore has turned towards the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is called on Land@@ mark Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to increase his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association argued that at the time the approval of 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette had no wind turbines , because at the time in Vier@@ sen due to the limit of the Schwal@@ m@@ tal which exists a wind @-@ concentration camp zone .
within this concentration @-@ area , construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , at the same time the concentration zone effects but a exclusion of wind use for the rest city area .
such zones should be a &quot; sealing &quot; of the landscape .
indeed , few days ago , the City of Vier@@ sen decided to change a second wind turbine zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but it had not approved the District government in Düsseldorf , because of a lack of forms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the lack of planning @-@ law , the shared appro@@ vals is still illegal and therefore allowed to take , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : the City Council decided once again on the wind@@ breaks zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still coming out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this point , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines was formally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been dealt with by the circle four@@ term since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained a narr@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes it to the occasion to re @-@ examine the matter again .
but they are not likely to conclude that the procedure will be stopped .
with a view on current procedures at the Board of Directors , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in content on the argum@@ entation of the &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette to build four per 200 metres high wind wheels .
already last year , the company participated in which the town quarters is central , le@@ ases with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of great terrain .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be met - this corresponds to approximately one @-@ fifth of the electricity requirements of all four @-@ day households .
the NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen City joined the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , and a stake in a wind farm in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the circle Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor cr@@ ush together : women dies in an aw@@ ful accident
one sk@@ inn@@ y traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 am on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ Wal@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn cable ) .
a woman was viol@@ ating here .
two other people were easily injured .
the country road was suspended over hours .
according to the police , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch accompanied by their passenger car with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as companion to L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel .
city and dealer plan the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za@@ ar and people from the region are to explore the shopping opportunities in the city in September .
the aer@@ os@@ ol and the municipal authorities want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 in order to l@@ ure its residents to the city &apos;s shopping streets .
like the chairman of the profession , Christian King , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; will sensi@@ tise the customers what offers the own town out of the usual supermarket product .
planned is therefore a market with regional suppliers , similar to the market .
in addition , domestic companies are to present themselves with their training places .
moreover , the shops of the city will invite you to &quot; M@@ It@@ ter@@ rains @-@ Shopp@@ e . &quot;
the action is aimed not only in inhabitants of the city and in the surrounding region .
in preparation : commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bag , that point out on the Ak@@ tions @-@ Week@@ end , so Christian King .
the Municipal Institu@@ tions and Trade Union collaborate with the industrial and Chamber of Commerce .
this makes the profession enter and the city into another stage of the project At@@ trac@@ tive downtown . &quot;
this includes new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ak@@ tiv Day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; including the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ak@@ amas Day &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; talks with all the entrepreneurs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tra@@ des@@ men and hosts , to make them active . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also attractive offers for Saturday and the renoun@@ cing of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential should be re @-@ established again or again .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many natives would have lost the city centre when they buy .
in the end everyone had to contribute to in@@ vigor@@ ate the city centre - to landlords , businesses across the city and associations .
it was bol@@ ted to overcome with a network the Le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy that made some extent that made king in the spring .
Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , leader of the I@@ HK @-@ Centers in Müh@@ l@@ hausen shared that there is the third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , for the first time , five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities .
beside the Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Wei@@ mar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and St@@ ay @-@ P@@ ago@@ da .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should promote the value of local trade and raise its importance for the common good of our cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the au@@ spices of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct and direct environment by his sales behavior .
two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
during construction it came to an inn in the school building .
new other people were injured .
with a gas of gas in the U.S. city of Minneapolis , two people were killed and nine others have been wounded , some of them were struggling .
according to the fire@@ brig@@ ade was on Wednesday ( local time ) still a vulnerable in critical condition .
a man died when a portion of a school building collap@@ sed at the explosion .
a first mis@@ m later was also dead .
among the dead it was an employee of the school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an unfortunate war , the authorities expected work on a gas pipeline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were few people in the building of the Bau@@ haha acade@@ my .
Tru@@ mp succeeded by telephone trans@@ criptions by telephone calls to Mexico under pressure due to payment of the limit at the border .
trans@@ cription of telephone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and Le@@ ading of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tru@@ mp requested in a telephone call with the Mexican president En@@ rique Pen@@ a Nie@@ to , publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
the U.S. President compl@@ ained because he denoun@@ ced the wall in public . according to him , he said to him , &quot; This is what you can &apos;t say to the press . &quot;
Tru@@ mp started his presidential campaign to establish a wall on the southern border of the US and to s@@ way , to pay Mexico for the project .
trans@@ cription of his first attack with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and presented a tense exchange .
Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull , that a trade for the US refugees mig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; ridicul@@ ously &apos; and &apos; silly , &apos; and that the pol@@ ls on the trade , which led by the Obama administration , would let him look like a &quot; de@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States .
Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; which is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford @-@ Mass@@ acre : activists run rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch , as a call for justice back on
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury was driven by a group of spectators in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and caught by mar@@ sh@@ es on the Ford @-@ bridge of Moore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , the bridge could reach the bridge , a group of white men came forward with tissues to block its path .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a middle aged man in a needle @-@ strip - took a long train at its ci@@ gar and looked after the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then the man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ l him out of the car ! &quot;
cry torn in pieces the silence , as a young black man from the passenger &apos;s seat was cr@@ acked .
thank@@ fully this terrible scene , which was played on 22nd July is only a post@@ ur@@ ser .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost all of them in the audience is very real si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 Civil Liber@@ ler come back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to em@@ ulate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever charged with murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person has been arrested - although we are seeing them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; said T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks , who helps in organizing the job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a strainer on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year former congress of the State of Georgia and a life of Civil Rights .
for him , the announcement appears as a dram@@ atic call to action and represents an annual memory of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that an injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; we want criminal prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to get fairness , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we get fairness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a judicial physician lays out a towel over the body of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on July 27 , 1946 .
according to F@@ BI branch , which were obtained by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men of Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding Graf@@ ships were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch process .
but no one was ever charged .
although the susp@@ ects have been on the free foot for decades , the citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions around the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made a clear decision by the Supreme Court of Justice for the first time , in favor of its voice in the summer .
about at the same time as choosing st@@ ach by the F@@ BI of the black Far@@ mp@@ guard Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a battle - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the ru@@ mor of the city was , that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby whom she carried , did not originate from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
but when they came to the prison quarters and the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge crossed , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surround the car .
&quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison , who arranged and arranged the mur@@ ders , and concludes a F@@ BI report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s also obvious that there was a compromise between state and local law enforcement , which was not only involved in the murder , evidence of removing the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks are still form@@ id@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a electoral law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they were all killed in order to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; when you register and when you vote , then this will happen . &quot;
nearly a decade has C@@ ass@@ andra Gre@@ ene led the annual announcement of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her representation is vi@@ vi@@ ous , po@@ ign@@ ant and explained in a kind of deep racism that many believe in America that it no longer exists in America .
it is difficult to watch , and to look more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that that is the point .
&quot; we do not want to talk about the Lyn@@ x , because we are confronted with the u@@ gl@@ iness in all of us , &quot; she said .
&quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done through . &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest of the Black - packed in a room and sil@@ ently made an overview of the piece started .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Green@@ es Co @-@ director .
for many years he has played the role of the boss , but he said the role will never become easier .
&quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room tried the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , which play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester sh@@ outs and bes@@ et him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n -- he , made of my own property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona reci@@ proc@@ ates the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laugh at the lau@@ re@@ ous .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; , asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said still ki@@ cking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I simply don &apos;t think that white people were &quot; n &quot; &quot; n &quot; n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , wit@@ ted one of the other black performers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you only need to get the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and precisely here the energy shifts in space , a feeling of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy trying to get this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says sharp and with im@@ prints .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
there is scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman who clo@@ th@@ ed with a funeral g@@ own , is above the cor@@ p@@ ses of actors and introduces &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks out in every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it there was a group of about four dozen spectators and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost ev@@ enly divided between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelling to see the performance , many come down only the street .
they have experienced every nearly eight hours of Georgia when Broo@@ ks performs it on a pilgrimage to the cemetery of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point the Mor@@ de has remained a anec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands on the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels a perfect table .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the bodies .
children ho@@ cken in their heads , register the counter@@ f@@ eit blood and the breastfeeding bodies and whis@@ pering each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; m@@ um@@ bles a little boy , as he wants to remember it .
after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene thanks Gre@@ ens - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ ch@@ rop@@ l and wi@@ pe their tears away .
Brad@@ sha@@ w sha@@ ded Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the move that has played the c@@ lan@@ member .
Nick Ras@@ cona orbit two of his fellow @-@ players and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional load of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you did that for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience starts together with the actors for dinner .
at a table , a white pair made from Atlanta leads to a coloring with a black couple that they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski strug@@ gled to find words what feeling the performance left .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come by people who look like yourself and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ne still continues &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today the only police shoot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks yard at his table , he e@@ ats and reminds of the civil rights .
he said he already started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the after@@ math is very inspiring , for it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it may happen again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he who is not studying his own story , who does not know his own story is sentenced to repeat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dä@@ mmerung &apos; drow@@ ned the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ re@@ uth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work director Frank Cast@@ orf sets on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e staging in front of gigantic , six @-@ storey setting .
the stage stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) reveals a s@@ hab@@ by street corner with a mart@@ rest and D@@ ön@@ d@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from the GDR &apos;s times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before it is an open Mercedes @-@ classic car , in which the R@@ hen@@ le@@ vers are pos@@ ing as rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively an is@@ setta .
Gest@@ hap@@ ed oil cas@@ ks recall Cast@@ or@@ fs Shi@@ mo@@ tiv - Money , Power and greed - that draws itself through its &quot; ring &quot; staging .
the three R@@ hen@@ le@@ vers - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise as already in the &quot; Rhin@@ gold &quot; wonderful .

Stephen M@@ illing sings the gorgeous fibro@@ us Ha@@ gen , which surrounds the au@@ ra of a wei@@ ghted box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when he sm@@ iled Sie@@ g@@ fried .
later I must still believe Gun@@ ther ( Mark Ei@@ che ) .
the audience thanks it to the ensemble with strong applause .
stor@@ my are Foster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and Di@@ rig@@ ent Jan@@ owski who is modest and moul@@ ding hands on Merkel @-@ smokers .
great applause for the festival orchestra , which is first on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in empty leisure clothes .
with tension the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his team ete@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 he had to let 2013 a rolling stand with himself , there were five years later big Ju@@ bel , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to be happy about this .
&quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; ring &quot; in some way , &quot; she had said just before the performance of d@@ pa .
the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it has also grown to an understanding of its view .
I prefer a positive Res@@ um@@ é .

what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it &apos;s a nice , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
you are 26 years now , so a late volunteer volunteer .
how does that come ?
quantity : I have done SL@@ C .
and then a civil engineering degree , we say very successful , successful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I recognised that it is true for me and I want to do something else with people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
take a social year since there is a look , there you can see how it is spot , in the focal point , perhaps , really .
and was it like this ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will launch my studies in social relations in the winter semester .
I will study carbon , probably do in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social work training and studied in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule .
is it not unusual , during the volunteer service to have several different kinds of applications ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it is always coming to where you make his FS@@ J .
you can do it from Alter@@ sheim to youth work - in all sorts of fac@@ ets of social work .
I was very varied with me .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that has mat@@ ured me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs .
different than in the civil engineering degree ?
quantity : well , here it is not about calcul@@ ating st@@ atics .
one has always imagined different people who each have a very different story behind each other .
whether a refugee is a teen@@ ager , a teen@@ ager , who has been removed from the family - you have to always go on to it individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations about that ?
quantity : I am not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
much love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but so life is just like that .
Pear@@ son releases other 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve the business .
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , she will build more 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate dividend by 72 percent as another restructuring program will start to overcome the pressure which the company is facing .
the job @-@ building , the Director @-@ General of John Fall@@ on , announced overwhel@@ m@@ ingly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , which has already been lost in 4.000 .
Pear@@ son announced in May in a third cost reduction programme to cost further 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to resume a business which was made by the rapid move to digital learning .
the company , which had expressed its participation in Pen@@ gu@@ in Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the fiscal year remained unchanged , after achieving an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds on the first half of the year .

a terrorist attack has attacked a military con@@ voy at the Afgh@@ an capital Cab@@ ul , a soldier of Nato killed and several others viol@@ ate , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter have been injured , shared a declaration of Nato .

the bombing raid is the last force that Afghanistan hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday a su@@ icide bom@@ bed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of Nato membership is to happen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an explosion on Thursday night when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by one &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impro@@ mpt@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injured in a stable state and in U.S. military hospital on the air@@ field of Bag@@ ram are treated .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a serious concern for NATO troops in the nearby bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , including around 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July a su@@ icide @-@ car@@ om@@ be killed at least 30 people in a mainly chic district of Kab@@ ul .

on 31 May a tremendous bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed over 150 people with the killing milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the US @-@ led troops urged the Taliban out of power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ scores the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , since U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops to support military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the su@@ icide bom@@ b@@ ate in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , its policies and especially in the call of President As@@ hr@@ af G@@ han@@ i .
EPA is making the decision to delay the smo@@ g usually after transport
the U.S. American environmental protection authority has a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ aled that the states are obliged to for@@ ci@@ ze the smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this was a day after 15 countries compl@@ ained because of the stri@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA has announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ zone @-@ regulations 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; them show the obligation of the agency to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and remember that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , in June , had announced the intention of EPA , which should be measured in part of the country &apos;s contam@@ in@@ ants , to specify where inc@@ isions are needed to delay stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year up to October 2018 .
a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , came for a law@@ suit on Tuesday and said that the effort is illegal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to set a wide range of environmental issues , which has imposed on President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda , which should boost economic growth , according to Tru@@ mp &apos;s economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , efforts have triggered the back of Democrats and reserves to worry about the impact greater emissions on public health .
the EPA website says that the inhal@@ ing of air , the o@@ zone incorpor@@ ates &quot; lung function and increase the symptoms of symptoms &quot; like asthma .
community wants community space
in the end , the decision was clear : with two bac@@ kl@@ ash , the municipal council of flu@@ u@@ orn winds up the establishment of a communal space in the future retirement residence .
there is an important information before the discussion : the purchase agreement for the still missing plot is signed , told Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
while it still will last until the municipality of the Church @-@ municipality of the municipality is still owned , but there is now no planning for the project from a private investor to st@@ em@@ ing project more .
there is a discussion regarding a common period .
one of the two investors , which are still in the boat , has offered to meet the church .
on the ground floor he would provide a living area - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters area for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the Council fle@@ ats ho@@ vers , such a common room can not be seen as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ act living , but openly into the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made a lap . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision will be made by providing funds for the current household already last autumn , by funding opportunities .
the building is in the refurb@@ ishment area .
the establishment of a common period would be so reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent beneficial .
the decisions taken to signal the investor that you want to throw him in this respect is no bil@@ lets between the legs , the not@@ ing that both saddle - and what exposure to the ambient - as well as pe@@ akers - which makes the tr@@ ack@@ down and the construction of an economic power - were also possible .
need@@ less , so not just Wil@@ fred sole , be this supplement .
if it helps : unanim@@ ously , it is happening in the body .
it is not that easy with the common common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many private buildings with which one can not move so much , that is the common room with the window , she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am struggling with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger speaks absolutely for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it looks behind it a covered Sub@@ si@@ dy to any high net worth or even foreign investors .
and that is not so , because with the purchase of the surface you do not give an allowance , but get a real , in doubt of a par@@ ent@@ able equivalent , is the counter @-@ speech .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers request to set up the decisions accordingly , will find three advocates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way it remains with two counterparts in the original program that summar@@ ise Stefan H@@ aller so : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we summar@@ ize the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

for the five defeats in the past six test , An@@ cel@@ otti has made the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team .
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical shape , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team .
the last one was not good . &quot;
the 58 @-@ year @-@ old however believes in performance enh@@ ancements in the first official mandatory play of the season .
&quot; soccer is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to be intelligent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is a &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

emig@@ rated to the star of the res@@ in of Stern
in the res@@ in , the nationwide &quot; star@@ ry &quot; is due to arise .
this is planning the association Stern@@ warte Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a planetary path are available in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star@@ ch ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come to the information desire of many hard@@ ships , it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connec@@ tedness with nature , science , movement and sporting performance .
the members want to set up the tables along the planned route and inform about stars and star paintings .
in a first phase up to 2018 , the &quot; well @-@ accessible installations in five to six locations &quot; is planning in Ober@@ har@@ z .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ask for St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Ho@@ gar@@ iness and Sie@@ ber . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the information on the boards should be supple@@ mented by the internet .
therefore in the setting of production a good mobile network welcome plays a role .
accessibility Is a crit@@ erion .
later the star@@ ch train should be extended by train .
&quot; on the star@@ ch , the observer experienced a lot of knowledge : for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association .
they also learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is stronger lumin@@ aire than another , although he could be far further away .
I &apos;ll also give in which constellation will find a selected star and when he is best to see .
the association has been operating at the Berg@@ städ@@ ter St. Andre@@ as@@ berg Hotel which is the highest located observatory of Northern Germany .
the location in the heart of the National Park Har@@ z is part of the Federal Environment Agency for Natural Oil at the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
frequently they are visible from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ meda @-@ galaxy with the naked eye clearly .
it has been in the university city since 2003 on the initiative of the Sup@@ porting Society Di@@ vin@@ ingen something similar to the planned star@@ base - the planet Earth .
starting in front of the h@@ ect@@ ards hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet stretches with its poles up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and at the observatory - as well as a &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ ards ( municipality ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the poles with the individual Plan@@ ets - including the d@@ warf @-@ plan@@ ed down@@ grade Plu@@ to at the end point - are set exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a height of 6.@@ 5 milli@@ meters in diameter , whereas the sun sets 75 meters above all 75 meters above sea level .
the complete distance of the planet is about four kilometers .
while the light from Sun to the planet Plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedest@@ rians need a good hour to the St@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedest@@ rians are thus faster than light in the cosmos .
the march to the next Fi@@ x@@ star would last more than one year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ ar Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ ar Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , which should be standing in a collision with the most exciting pit @-@ fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , the un@@ varnis@@ hed World Bo@@ xing Council body Champion , the hallway leads down to Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko , the World Bo@@ xing organization super @-@ spring champion to be welcomed .
according to Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through an agre@@ eable decision on the former four @-@ divisions &quot; World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ zer on Saturday in Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it to you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
as the couple for photos , Lom@@ a@@ en@@ ko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as , that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect size . &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; reminded Gar@@ cia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I grew up for bronze &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to down@@ stream on a body @-@ weight .
and it has to move on belly wei@@ ghted &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then fight .
this demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko was agreed .
&quot; bo@@ xing needs this fight . &quot;
climate change asked if it should be on pay @-@ per view , part of a strategy to schedule the Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year , to schedule a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) which also interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell after whose lightweight , championship fight in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; this battle could be held in pay @-@ by @-@ view mode because all fans asked him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and expressed themselves later , to fight in the network that offers the best financial package .
we are the best .
no other names can cause this kind of attention .
when they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he will see Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he &apos;ll be able to participate on his Saturday battle .
but Lom@@ a@@ en@@ ko held with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the three @-@ fight champion from River@@ side view &quot; very slow , I &apos;m sorry Mi@@ key ... You wanted to be co @-@ Aus . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show strength , then bo@@ xing .
both said they could feel the momentum they built for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the fight to be done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ a@@ en@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been waiting for the top fighters and that is Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four wounded for tyre plat@@ zer
in case of an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were injured on Thursday and four people .
after first information lost the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira against 16.@@ 30 p.m. , shortly before the connection of the connection , the driver probably lost control of his vehicle .
the passenger sh@@ ook off right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he struck , and then stayed on the roof in the strip .
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were badly injured during the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by b@@ ail@@ out service , the A@@ 7 was locked in direction north for about an hour , then the traffic could pass on the left @-@ road at the accident place .
Fort@@ unas : &quot; Trinity &quot; works better &quot;
Andre Hoff@@ man hopes after 2 : 2 for the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that the optimization of def@@ enses in Au@@ e counts .
with the first performance , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , as not the two oppos@@ ites would have been at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we must fit even better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enses of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the tri@@ erk@@ ette should also be further optimised .
and a gate after a break @-@ up is also no longer wanting to feed the Fort@@ unas .
&quot; for the future it will be that no one is next to Michael ( R@@ ensing ) onto the line . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the experiences in the preparation with the three @-@ column , than with the four &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; qu@@ artet &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; nor do I know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer bur@@ ial place , but Hoffmann is himself to be sure , &quot; because we have just installed in the three @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a prerequisite is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ ieren and do not contribute so many ab@@ uses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann will also go to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one cannot speak after a draw from a failed start , do not know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Ms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if we stand on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the tro@@ phy we will surely speak of the season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about this his coach did not want to know anything .
&quot; the start of the season evalu@@ ates I only after six to eight seasons , &quot; said cem@@ eter@@ ies , who don &apos;t want to speak from an advantage over Au@@ e only because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken off because of a storm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season practically with a HE@@ IM@@ SP@@ IEL , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fun@@ kel and Hoffmann , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said that players from Au@@ e might be even something fresh , since they wouldn &apos;t have he@@ avier and complete game like Fort@@ una , against an ascension @-@ breeding in the bone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not know about 100 percent where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland as an easy favourite on Sunday will be at last ( almost ) the stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are swe@@ pt away , only because we have the claim to come under the first six , is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fun@@ kel , whose record is entirely positive with only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the second Bundesliga to propose &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Fort@@ unas and coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such a statement is arrogan@@ t and more hetero@@ geneous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so , Fun@@ ds will not experience his players on Sunday in any case .
new results published by the Swedish asylum @-@ rate review
the latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , who were subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that over 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . however , not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for for@@ en@@ sic medicine ( Sing@@ ing medic@@ in@@ al@@ hi@@ et ) began with the implementation of the tests last year .
they should make the assessment of the age more precise during the asylum process after the Swedish migrants authority ( migration flows ) was critic@@ ised due to the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were under@@ age .
until today &apos;s migration has been sent around 6.@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2.@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or more , whereas in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person may &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are growing steadily for the past months .
&quot; we do not see a big difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said the local magazine The Local .
the high proportion of cases when the person was judged above 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seekers above his age have been lied .
in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the person examined 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det the 5@@ 81 results issued , it found that in the 243 of these cases the person had said openly that they would be 18 years old .
the method of medical age evaluation , in the x @-@ rays of Weis@@ ors and MR@@ I scans of sound di@@ stract , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a skep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ olin@@ ska Institute whose work involves the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see whether they went sooner or later as usual through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it , and I do not believe the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to assess the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
if we can &apos;t say it for sure , we should not do as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper metro .
Gö@@ ran@@ sson by the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in the Plan
the work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday , a seven ton of gravity was attached to the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it works great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold L@@ ess , Bau@@ leader at the Department of street and Transport in the governing council of Freiburg .
in April the works started simultaneously to all three reconstructed bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and Easy is certain that the schedule is met .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ ault @-@ gen@@ gen@@ sis made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges also , it has now come to the years .
to ensure the stability and road safety , the three buildings are now comprehen@@ sively restored .
the other two bridges lead across the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built from red @-@ brick stone .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , and 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance to the entrance to Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1,@@ 30 metres wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called fr@@ ing@@ cap .
this is a random draw , which is also used as an operating path .
on the southern part of the bridge , a 2.@@ 20 metre can be used on Friday .
on this then the pedestrian route went away .
the special thing is that it is a part of finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges have already provided with the patented bridge @-@ caps .
special finger@@ board feeling has demanded the wir@@ ing of leader@@ ships by the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also an fibre cable , connected to which many companies are connected .
the inhabitants were informed about the project in advance of the work .
in addition , first fish and cancer were forced to turn off .
for the bridges between the building of the building and the ren@@ dez@@ her in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg the traffic is regulated by a traffic @-@ lane .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher &apos;s entrance , the road is locked in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof , &quot; and &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den &quot; fully locked .
the costs for the three frac@@ tures are 700 000 Euro .

it isn &apos;t so frequent that parties are pulling in a rope but when it comes to alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , which else is difficult to get under a hat .
the parties represented in Kre@@ ist@@ ag Vol@@ x@@ oph@@ el represented parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a wide alliance that will be shown on this day peacefully because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ an invites to the &quot; great election campaign . &quot;
and known names at the start brings - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land , formed the top directors of the Bundest@@ ags @-@ election on September 24 , and vice @-@ president Beatri@@ x by Stor@@ ch .
but those who are already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D voters , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot;
originally the town @-@ pic@@ ni@@ cs was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the fountain spot , but now finds in the parking space below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle .
a colourful picture that offers .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair of the Forum One World and one of the leading organizers , really pleased : &quot; great , how many people have come together here . &quot;
there is music and plenty of food , including a &quot; age german potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D easily , &quot; says the woman who brought it back .
the police force many officials from Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it also shows presence , mainly at the station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how has the Af@@ D come on Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported from the Af@@ D Vol@@ c@@ ines , he tried to make such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked about in Dau@@ n , but there is a cancellation , because because of the already built @-@ in tree @-@ owned kir@@ k , there are not enough parking places available .
well , the Ron@@ del , Hom@@ es is delighted that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; facing the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does : at 8@@ pm on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle various speakers , including the R@@ hen@@ land @-@ pf@@ alz region Uwe Junge .
in the hall there are about 200 list@@ eners who are waiting for the spit@@ zen@@ kan@@ atin for the Bundest@@ ags @-@ election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Chairman of the Beatri@@ x von Stor@@ ch .
unchanged is the police force , but so far the officers had a quiet evening .
a little over an hour will take you to the Af@@ D event , guests on the front desk have long breath , but there is also a short amount of time after 9 pm .
the police can dis@@ locate - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets the trumpet
a reunion with the Wolf@@ maker Pos@@ aun@@ ch@@ Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series of Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ freiheit , tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 p.m. in the clo@@ ak watch .
together with the Bulgarian Tro@@ mp@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Schwarz@@ meer hits Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to classical German training with roots in brass music . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winning and winners of numerous international competitions and have acquired Sol@@ opo@@ si@@ tions in European leaders .
thus Pet@@ kov Cha@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is available at the prestigious Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ ov &apos;s the SW@@ R Symph@@ onic orchestra .
both united the desire not only to exceed the boundaries of their instrument but also merge the limits of different gen@@ res .
Johann Sebastian Bach at the two as in a new guise , Daniel S@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; united with Bulgarian folklore , and in piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the J@@ az@@ ze@@ ch@@ op@@ re@@ istr@@ al N@@ ils Ge@@ gram , mix classical , jazz and the free playing to a fascinating overall work of art .
this core program of the program was first performed this spring with long @-@ term success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils Wo@@ gram has written it for the two musicians and wrote more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ p@@ erk@@ ir@@ che with her special acou@@ sti@@ cs will be consciously included into the concert .
Kr@@ isten Stewart speaks about their bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; some people love gri@@ lled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I would like to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stewart recently openly about their bis@@ ex@@ ual sides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I teach in gri@@ lled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; .
the probably most well @-@ known relationship of the Hol@@ ly@@ re stars was the one of their &quot; t@@ wilight &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ in@@ son , who eventually went bitter .
despite all that ass@@ ures the brunette performer compared to the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar . magazine : &quot; I was in any serious atmosphere I &apos;ve posted .
or do you believe , I have played it ? &quot;
after her separation , Kr@@ isten gave him that she bis@@ ex@@ ual , and said , &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed in the du@@ alism .
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
I just liked it to be taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially among them I have suffered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but at school time as they rather disgu@@ ised like a book : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really got me hurt .
when I was 11 I told the children , I would look like a bu@@ b .
I felt really attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girls , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public does not love their love @-@ life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to take you in a certain way , and anno@@ yed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anch@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but I don &apos;t like it to be justified before the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
. the Democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tru@@ mp where he will change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have been away from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as the inhabitants of West Virginia , I cannot help you if I am a democratic Gover@@ nor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the manifestation broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to Re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a trainer I would say it &apos;s time to play a different game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp promised a major announcement in the West Virginia Rall@@ ye .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice is not approved by the Democratic candidate of Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , who according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes presents that he has coal min@@ t in five countries and have inherited a carbon @-@ business from his father .
he is worth approximately 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday night announced a statement in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party which would rather prevent us from working in order to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 govern@@ ors and the control of the least legal entities in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor is the final ref@@ usal of a party that is from above to below without guidance and is unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ president Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e lo@@ ges &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the worldwide leader of the athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday , what he described as an open excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sports .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics boss , Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the athle@@ tics world championship that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , I am sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were carved from competitions gold and silver medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ground@@ ing , which was imposed in November 2015 , after a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) has found evidence on state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e to repor@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognised with itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and do everything possible to make sure the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia was accepting the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made but the congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alise this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athlete from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
ninete@@ en Russian athletes will start at the athle@@ tics World Championships on Friday in London based on the strict ad@@ AF criteria as a neutral actors .
the Director of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Andersen , said on Monday that Russia should still meet some of the criteria for a re@@ setting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; threats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; threats are still inadequate and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; forbidden trainer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said repor@@ ters in London after a talk at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
funeral sector for in Mali pl@@ ung@@ ed soldiers
at a funeral service in the Nor@@ h@@ ess@@ ian Frit@@ z@@ lar have thought about 1000 people of the two at a helicopter @-@ crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city by high security arrangements .
in the un@@ resolved background , Secretary of Defense , Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they drew the two pointed pilots but as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ eb@@ ner of their field &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tend to have the highest sacrifice which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old town of Nord@@ h@@ essen were killed on Wednesday a week in the West African Mali .
their spar@@ rows were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a total guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the deep jungle of St. Peter .
at lun@@ ch@@ time only the relatives were placed in the Church goodbye .
then the funeral service began in the circle of the family , closest friends , from representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics .
below are also Hess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general spec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wie@@ ker .
gro@@ an@@ ed rose rose to ro@@ ses , the relatives were arm in arm at the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ es and numerous soldiers watched the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary of Defense from the Le@@ yen described the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elevated soldiers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and will be crus@@ hed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann made the plane of the fighting h@@ our@@ er tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar with built and was one of the first six @-@ trained Tiger @-@ pilots of its Regim@@ ent .
also Volker Bau@@ ers@@ al , commander of the Regim@@ ent in which the soldiers belong , stated : &quot; if that occupation could not turn the crash , then it would not have wasted . &quot;
doub@@ tless the UN mission in Mali , Minister of the Le@@ yen made it dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is of high importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral service the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they will be ta@@ xed , the Bundes@@ wehr did not hold information .
prince Hen@@ rik does not want a tomb beside his wife
the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ a ( 77 ) , prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , would not be o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed by his death next to his wife .
that divided the Royal House on Thursday with .
traditionally the Danish kingdom is buried in the cathedral @-@ church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard was already prepared a Sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen was with the decision of her husband , it was further in the message .
where prince Hen@@ rik is buried , is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he did not have the intention of being buried in his French country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
prince Hen@@ rik has never made a secret of it that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ a in 1972 he would have loved to be king .
in 2016 he reti@@ res and also sets the title &quot; Princ@@ ge@@ ma@@ hl . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark don &apos;t have the title and the function he wanted to see himself from his wife not as equivalent to him - even after death , L@@ ene b@@ alle@@ by explained the boss in the Danish kingdom .
where the last resting @-@ place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he did not have the intention of being buried in his French country but in Denmark . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French Nob@@ ility , had seen Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
at the Thames , he worked in the French Embassy .
during his later woman the sympath@@ ies of the people always helpl@@ essly , the prince Hen@@ rik in his almost 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es have a heavy stand .
in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did .
my D@@ än@@ isch was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , sil@@ ky quart@@ ets instead of kn@@ itting , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Vol@@ vo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and who had the issue here , the reputation of social intellectual intellectuals , I was not able to hope for the view .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were the same two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants to re @-@ election swift new election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of potential majority in Lower Saxony
low @-@ esteem Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green period for a rapid re @-@ election of the land@@ day , but does not want to come back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the Parliament spoke for the resolution of the Parliament on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprise of a Gre@@ bis@@ cite from a Green Party in Lower Saxony had precip@@ it@@ ated the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Land@@ tag , the red @-@ green Coalition in Hannover lost its scarce A @-@ vote majority in the Parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets set up their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election 2018 in their constitu@@ ency @-@ circle ( des@@ erts ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future at the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared Friday in Hannover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ U chief of Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler intends to recommend his group to record them .
associated with it CD@@ U and F@@ DP together 69 seats in the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship was the opposite .
the new Land@@ tag will be officially elected as of the 14th of January .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the red @-@ green power government must now decide whether they could rule in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l is essential however , that the landing stage decides as soon as possible its self @-@ solution .
the CD@@ U faction is expected to make a further decision on Tuesday .
the State dra@@ wer also provides the possibility that the country &apos;s day chooses the Prime Minister and choose a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these opportunities must be properly checked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all questions if they are legally reasonable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the policy himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
it was a wor@@ m@@ ist from black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called on the accused number of members for the return of their land meeting .
&quot; we are , of course , that she has received her Land@@ tag , which she has received over the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; shared the Landes@@ bank Met@@ a Jan@@ s@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner discussed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the group leader of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have deliberately decided not to lead an pron@@ unciation in the group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even before the background that there were no sub@@ stan@@ tive differences , we cannot trace this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ an@@ did@@ at Martin Schulz condemned the authority of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ ests to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Gre@@ ens in Lower Saxony is not just betra@@ yal of the constitu@@ encies and constitu@@ ents but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote the President of the Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly renew the country day .
the exit Tw@@ enty costs red @-@ Green in Nieder@@ sachsen the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the policy chief &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their van@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their frustration and in their frustration , expressed their personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critici@@ zed SPD general Secretary of Hu@@ ber@@ tus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony starts this dirty war and attempts to propose political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
low @-@ concern CD@@ U @-@ fac@@ tion@@ ists Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler intends to recommend his parliament@@ arians to put El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets into the CD@@ U .
the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw out T@@ jack@@ ets with face @-@ to @-@ face career path the outcome of the Sunday &apos;s election in 2013 .
the CD@@ U was at that time the SPD &apos;s strongest force , SPD and Green had a semi @-@ thin majority of one voice in the country .
agriculture ministers in the interview - How do we protect ourselves against poison , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discusses about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Minister for Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is mentioned in an interview with the Federal Republic of Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from poison@@ ing eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage consumer within and consumer to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the st@@ amping pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the consumer protection portal www.@@ gro@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de the Bundes@@ länder represent the most recent information on the hard @-@ charge eggs each .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
also , if after all we know at the moment , an health haz@@ ard practically is practically excluded .
is Al@@ di the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs come out of the offer - because the central role of the enligh@@ ten@@ ant of the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really seen ?
food monitoring is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless my house has immediately turned up and is since the announcement of Germany &apos;s announcement in close contact with the authorities of the countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and the risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade has just as much as the manufacturers to ensure that the goods sold is safe and hygien@@ ically safe .
if for eggs of the back @-@ load content of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are non @-@ refundable .
un@@ loaded eggs are however sold and consumed .
this time is not the factories to blame .
do factories and consumers sit in the same boat ?
after the same level of knowledge , the factories meets no immediate guilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , it must be expected because of alleged illegal practices of service companies with economic damages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as always there is a lack of chec@@ kers in the harvest .
is it missing only at the staff or even at the conclu@@ sive competence ?
it was just the official controls that have uncovered the procedure .
for truth , however , food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out of 100 percent .
this is precisely why a consistent explanation of such events and the hand@@ over to the pro@@ secut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences are protected , are of crucial importance .
I have spoken many times over many times that I would expect an incomplete education by the responsible authorities .
is the regular stabili@@ mis@@ m at food @-@ sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumer consumer and consumers have the right to get solely safe and high @-@ conditioning foods .
if an un@@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide in the food industry is used , consumer within and consumer are rightly outra@@ ged .
through the cl@@ apping , manufacturers , traders and consumers are advised in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of living animals is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately .
this must be done on all levels at all levels and worked with high pressure .
I expect from all the relevant authorities , that the atomic fact is spe@@ edi@@ ly and fully elu@@ ci@@ dated .
how the financial statements of the Football Cup on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ har@@ sh@@ attered issues of European foot@@ ball@@ ers will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A , as the leading institution , which over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban cre@@ ws from the access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules , which were launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G sometime to point out that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million euros ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar is receiving a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can make sure the money free@@ ze , so N@@ ey@@ mar it writes and bring it into a galaxy of other stars , given the funding of the team by the energy @-@ rich officer of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to purchase a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but must be subject to legitimate revenue sources , which allow them to make the break @-@ up secondary point in their on the football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini as part of his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that associations in their quest for success had taken enormous debt , effectively decei@@ ving and risky to ruin , if banks or owners re@@ ar@@ ed their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P moved from concentration to the debts of the clubs to monitor its losses .
the amendment meant that the business model was used , the Roman A@@ br@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch , originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then managed to build a global brand - to build a global brand - to become a tougher business .
during the recent three @-@ year comparison period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses in the amount of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini was like to please by the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ ut@@ in will continue to be deter@@ red from excessive expenses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certainly , FF@@ P is not dead and we will step up the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is in charge of RE@@ P &apos;s UEF@@ A , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out version of N@@ ey@@ mar in a Pau@@ line , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ ices over the duration of the contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the resolution can be re@@ funded over the next five years in the amount of 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million euros per year &apos;s financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hosted the PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G has received a penalty of 60 million Euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which later was reduced to 20 million euros - and it became arranged that the Mann@@ it@@ ates members are limited to the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A UEF@@ A is on the search for clubs that could try to list its financial statements by turning their income through companies affiliated with the owners of a club .
while a Hungarian company could sponsor the PS@@ G , if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not exceed the legitimate income .
this happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A determined that the P@@ SA &apos;s value was b@@ lown by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G Pay@@ ments to N@@ ey@@ mar concluded about payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have disputed that N@@ ey@@ mar Championship drivers are to be held and a like @-@ like maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators are easy to find out .
the former sanctions against PS@@ G means that the UEF@@ A will still be more attentive to take note of any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEF@@ A won no preliminary discussions with PS@@ G through N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports indicate that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a sales of 5@@ 4@@ 2.@@ 4 million .
the accounts for the last financial year must be published as well .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrived a bo@@ on for sponsorship de@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ pod .
the association assumes that sales after signature by at least 30 percent will increase .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players going to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s guide@@ posts by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; funded dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s official owner .
arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League for a State that finances a association .
&quot; it is the consequence of the owners and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday .
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the financing of Fair@@ play because you can have different ways or have different interests if one country has such a major player to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is in search of a new shock supplier .
in the past years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board has been created for Swiss .
now the flows of cooperation is standing in front of one possible end : the airline writes the order new .
Swiss @-@ speaking at Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency SD@@ A to report a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Northwest Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
following current planning , the Air@@ line will open a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products were reviewed every two to three years and subjected to a quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the speaker .
around 17 million small rot@@ ten zi@@ pped Sho@@ gg@@ it@@ af@@ eln to distribute on 14 grams a year before the landing of the passengers to the passengers .
Swiss does not want to provide Swiss information about the cost .
however , the order volume in the &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; will be estimated to be 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the mig@@ ros daughter achie@@ ves an annual turnover of about one billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the adver@@ t @-@ effect : for a shock manufacturer it is a prestigious location .
as many applicants are there with the new tender , Swiss does not want to betra@@ y .
but only Swiss manufacturers come to question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to strive for a renewal of the contract concerning spring 2018 .
for the SD@@ A the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .
chocolate tables distributed Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before holding a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut was supplied in collaboration with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablet .
the possibility to place the logo , Swiss launched two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ range flights the customers of First Class with treats would be pampered , in business class Ms Scho@@ gg@@ i by Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
in the short track Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i distributed by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; to the N@@ ische Zeitung
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gically because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ er years , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ years @-@ fr@@ ame@@ die @-@ com@@ edy ( The State &apos; for M@@ TV rotating ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd came to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally par@@ o@@ dy and an embodiment of our Facebook @-@ capable form of permanent memories .
but as a franchise , it feels like the time would be close .
&quot; first day of Camp &quot; surprisingly good , not only because of its absur@@ dum@@ its ( it contained an original story for a promising sc@@ anned vegetables that had been spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by rel@@ ying on the core of the day - actor middle age , vacc@@ inated children , who will grow up - still manage the im@@ possibility to regain the last part of the weather .
&quot; ten Years later , &quot; with his adults , who now play adults is less emotional , and its par@@ o@@ dy is more dependent on the poly@@ mer &apos;s principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ er years like &quot; The Hand Side Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The hand , the cradle the cradle &quot; ) .
at one point , a character comprised through an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some in@@ line Sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gracious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show old ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ e@@ au ) still not forgotten .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not lost his vir@@ gin@@ ity .
and there is another crazy @-@ mal@@ ign@@ ant P@@ lot , included in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( even Mr. Show@@ old ) , who now is supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ made impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always the ex@@ tradition is the best part of the franchise .
it is particularly fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ lu@@ sion@@ er of &quot; singles &quot; shows , whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy .
these are the moments of random fol@@ ly that this franchise may be like a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches that which I &apos;ll show off as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years ago , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Amazon now reminds on a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War by &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Atom@@ ic B@@ lon@@ de &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ low &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its East @-@ West @-@ West @-@ struggle @-@ icon@@ ography . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka , who spoke with Rh@@ ys Thomas as a director , a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who are fighting for truth , athe@@ ism and the path of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism .
the protagon@@ ist - a hard @-@ red Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ ose@@ f - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogs by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt to be syn@@ ced to English .
it is an in@@ geni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some beautiful G@@ ags to watch ( the police spend time playing chess on television as Americans may do it with football ) .
and the list of the famous narr@@ ator , including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - takes out the voice for an ongoing game &apos;@@ Fin@@ de . &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is involved so much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a distr@@ au@@ ght propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer that we@@ ars a Re@@ agan mask , that there is often a single one playing .
for six long episodes , the com@@ edy stops and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which could better deliver its ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ S@@ ati@@ re better , as Gregor and I@@ ose@@ f again visit the US Embassy , whose Lobby is always occupied by two big men who are always a tro@@ op of ham@@ burger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Communist audience &apos;s message is that Western culture can make everything for food for a space .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian creators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and theirs .
blow against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police have a blow to the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , at the Black Forest , in Rot@@ tw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ Circle , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Con@@ stance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart many objects were searched through , as the Public Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Con@@ stance on Friday afternoon .
15 lab@@ ours were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and were already issued in arrest warran@@ t against this .
in addition , the officials asked bigger amounts marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , as well as several hundred thousand Euros .
at the same raid in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two suspi@@ cious Italians there were German Ar@@ rest War@@ rant .
the two are therefore probably delivered to Germany .
in the action Italian and Bav@@ arian investigations were involved .
in total , over 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the members of the Mafia will be organised crime crime , heavy violence , tried murder , as well as rob@@ bery and ex@@ tor@@ tion . &quot;
since the summer of 2016 , the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Con@@ stance against organised drug trafficking in the South German region .
between the Public Pro@@ secut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo , a br@@ isk exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
so big effort was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning .
in doing so , the investigations presented primarily by Italian pro@@ secut@@ ors in relation to the Italian ma@@ fia .
a incident took place on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , which were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account of the Ban@@ de .
thus , large gaps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens that should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : a report indicates the foreig@@ ner in Germany has considerable shortcomings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lead to some serious mis@@ steps in asylum @-@ procedures .
the term for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Roth , has drawn attention to a media report according to large gaps in the country @-@ country reg@@ isters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the recorded data could result in asylum methods and de@@ port@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding some serious mis@@ steps &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; warned accordingly in an analysis that is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; South German newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Register , according to some 10 million people with foreign citizenship , some 5,@@ 7 million are recorded from non @-@ EU countries .
the data are therefore managed by about 600 agencies in Germany .
because the data was not sufficiently well maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good at all so far .
in some cases , data from 1921 were found , &quot; of people who have long been no longer alive , or of citizens who have become the German citizen and are not supposed to emerge in the register . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faul@@ ty data backup can be significantly slow@@ ing back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says the report continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics relating to the travelling human rights , the EU citizen is captured which would not have to travel at all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such false formations led to a distor@@ ted debate about dealing with pron@@ o@@ car@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it says therefore in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the German government has obviously begun to send refugees families with 16 @-@ year children back to Italy when they have travelled from there .
this is drawn from an internal paper of the Federal Government for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BAM@@ F ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ ro@@ cker newspaper . &quot;
in the paper it is said , the BAM@@ F lead such procedures &apos; regarding families with children - with the exception of infants and to@@ dd@@ lers - from Italy since June 1 , 2017 .
since the end of 2014 this was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper uses a reference to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin agreement , the EU is responsible for refugees of the EU state to first achieve them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a Mig@@ rant is travelling to a different EU country , the state can send it back to the traveler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to justify the post office &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the recep@@ tive capacity has increased significantly to families with minor children in Italy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy gave to the reception and accommodation of families warran@@ ties .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ r@@ t@@ HR ) obtained these promises for sufficient .
other EU states would send refugees back to the Dublin Agreement within the Dublin Agreement .
the internal political spokes@@ person in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children , thre@@ aten to the im@@ perfec@@ tions in the Italian asylum system , un@@ lawful terms and a endangering of the child &apos;s health . &quot;

so sometimes three people could benefit from a blood@@ stream .
at the same time Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported of the actions performed in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result in 114 don@@ ators , &quot; said the DR@@ K county manager .

the Bank of England will hold the interest rates of 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England will probably later announce that the interest rates will remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation led the spec@@ ulations over a rise .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth will &quot; stay &quot; than they hold the interest rates on family income in the midst of intensi@@ fying pressure .
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 for keeping interest rates on 0.@@ 25 % , whereas the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in its quarterly report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1,@@ 7 % and by 2018 to 1.@@ 6 % and warned that pressure on fiscal income would continue to continue , whereby inflation in the autumn is likely to rise to almost 3 % .
but she sign@@ alized that in the next few years Zin@@ o@@ ases would be necessary to ch@@ ap the inflation of Bre@@ xit and she said that the credit costs would have to increase more than expected on financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw a part of the Mam@@ mut @-@ recovery package that was published a year after Bre@@ xit .
it will demand time for financial investment plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from the coming February , although it is expected that they will provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion Po@@ unds Ster@@ ling .
minutes after the decision on the interest rate said the Bank : &quot; in the central pre@@ diction of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , since pressure on real@@ ein@@ ation of households will continue to use consumption . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the interest rates repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain imp@@ unity of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something greater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be required than markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that Hei@@ gh@@ ings would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the forec@@ ast@@ ed growth forecasts for this and next year will be a total of 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the growth forecasts in May .
it has maintained its growth forecasts at 1.8 percent in the year 2018 .
the pound rather fell to the dollar compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 dollars and fell by 0.1 % to 1.@@ 11 Euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent disappointing growth slow@@ ed down the rising expectations for a further increase and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months has risen to 0,@@ 3 % .
growth will be due to 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year .
the most recent In@@ fl@@ ation@@ ary report offered little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by rising inflation and minor changes , as the tigh@@ tening will first get worse before they get repaired .
it added that monetary policy in the coming years can &apos;t prevent revenue from income , but it added that wages will be able to recover at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot;
the economy is also reinforced by the rising demand for British goods , which is attri@@ but@@ able to the weak pound , which will compens@@ ate for a portion of lower consumption expendi@@ tures .
the decision is coming one year after lowering the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that condemned the sin@@ king of the pin@@ tor@@ ment .
the Bank appreci@@ ates that it will probably take four years until this will achieve the prices and the economy .
prior to the final judgment of the bank on interest rates , the call has risen to a further increase , as the inflation increased pressure on hard pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July called a rise to 0.5 % .
inflation was dropped last month from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.@@ 6 % , although the Bank said this was expected and will be attracting it again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said the crossing in relation to their goal of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to write a weak pound weight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew C@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ mort@@ broker , said : &quot; in the face of the s@@ wap foot@@ steps , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive , as the len@@ ders are looking to businesses and want to end the year in a positive way .
the market looks very good for those where existing de@@ cks run and the new mort@@ g@@ ages will be completed and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) will cast more cont@@ entious HIV drug drug .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that a pre @-@ refer@@ ee prophy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the infection risk in high @-@ risk experiments by about 86 percent , now from health service to a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he was willing to finance the process after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice last year after which N@@ HS had authority to pay for the Pr@@ EP despite the asser@@ tion that local authorities should finance him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England leader Simon Stev@@ ens as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the First , which will allow the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
prevention of prevention ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV supplements that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduces HIV @-@ transmission in infectious diseases .
Pr@@ EP in front of intercourse means taking just enough drugs in a person present in order to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so two hours before the intercourse .
those who come for treatment in question include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV positive partners that have not been treated successfully .
clinics , suitable participants are identified that will agree to the study , including men , women , transfers and individuals who have a partner , whose HIV status is not known as anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and are registered with a resident physician can also opt @-@ in for possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of the drugs this week after an international competitive purchase .
the study is intended to assess the full potential of the Pr@@ EP by placing clinical evidence on how it is implemented in a large scale , implemented and implemented .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should be the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts for preventing HIV to supplement and over@@ take .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in addressing the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive of NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if it is targeted at vulnerable and endangered people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .
from September to people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and is not subjected to a negotiation with a partner that leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority now must be made that the study is carried out rapidly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , as the Pr@@ EP test@@ es has been created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , Sha@@ der Health Minister said : &quot; the beginning of the EP process is welcome after months of delays and hesit@@ ant implementation by the government and over@@ due .
the evidence show how transforming this drug as a part of our approach to HIV prevention can be and can end the transfer of this life @-@ changing infection .
this try brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of the EP .
now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that they will contribute to ending the spreading of HIV in society a step closer . &quot;
the big Life live : me@@ zz@@ anine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , shr@@ unken in 2014 from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
situated on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold their bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I searched for something that was comparable to my price .
I showed this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have fallen in love with them and made an offer on that day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square footage was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a shared layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne dam and a me@@ zz@@ anine to make the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she instructed the Archit@@ ec@@ tural Design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed from Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill that util@@ ise 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two spaces over@@ each other , leaving the architectural challenge to lay a me@@ zz@@ anine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think creative to solve the presentation .
&quot; the steel works is quite complicated . &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were inter@@ tw@@ isted , without we needed to shift . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel on it that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement made it Re@@ fan to place two spaces in full height - with a lot of extra drama .
for the me@@ zz@@ anine floor a classic copper light window overlooking the glam@@ orous living area .
Ge@@ pie@@ sa@@ iled gold furniture , sil@@ ber@@ ne acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illum@@ ination put the style for the program .
the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to take him longer .
the kitchen feels the mirror of a window into another room .
at the entrance we split units space for all seating area and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a glam@@ orous space the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchen are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a guard .
&quot; a bit of engineering went in it , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the st@@ ahl@@ reinforced , fur@@ ni@@ fied M@@ DF @-@ door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important , so when you push the door is very easy to push . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could win extra 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base space - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and generate a calculation based on the soil size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the ground floor and at the same time use high quality materials , which give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you do not love the electric plu@@ gs into the walls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself by good design and increased square footage of something absolutely stunning .

brothers fight for a 500 million dollar lease
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the Dyn@@ asty , a confrontation with one of the largest real estate imperial Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as worth more than 500 million dollars .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer of Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets will be divided .
Paul has been planning to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp rise above the separation takes place at the Supreme Court of Justice .
together with her mother Anna the brothers met 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family was bought a shop at Smith Street , Col@@ ling@@ wood .
he founded the West@@ co E@@ ans family and grew into a chain of 160 retail outlets .
it was sold in 1999 to 85 million US dollars .
this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento that include the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
according to an agreement with their late father Col@@ in - is described by Paul as the main operator and the dominant personality in the De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul , about a third .
a judicial record states that Col@@ in property has the value of $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul has in the value of 17@@ 6 million dollars .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem @-@ point for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those proposed by Col@@ in proposed reviews have left him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in an initial aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed plac@@ ements took place the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice .
the brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business , of which Col@@ in , like Paul Shachtman asser@@ ted him .
Col@@ in argued that this is not true , but thro@@ ws Paul in advance to manage some possessions in@@ competent .
in an early affair , which has been submitted by Col@@ in , he says , he hope to put the dispute .
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of sites with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading attor@@ neys , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides to law firm .
Mrs De Lu@@ tis and her husband &apos;s husband Luigi were the Italian immigrants who runs dairy bars and delic@@ acy transactions dating back to the late 1950 @-@ ies and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
they used the security to buy the Col@@ ling@@ wood @-@ property , in which Col@@ in the first je@@ ans store the family opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in says he began from West@@ co , when he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my last years of the High School &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , did hope to pass her property on her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi has often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , with Col@@ in claimed that Mark paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million in leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the conditions of their financial division . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has kept very back , though he was a former AF@@ L board member and was a biography from the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media participated with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their attor@@ neys .
only Col@@ in answered by SMS , to say &quot; I can really not say much &quot; because the case before the courts may be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother had decided to wi@@ den me and draw our family names through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in writing to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; our father did not have wanted , that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; he said and added that he &quot; was still hoping for a solution . &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our issue will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s of new staff is planning to restrict the media dis@@ su@@ ction of the president .
others have tried and have failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if yes , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reports that the new Chairman of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp - including reports of the news media - hoping to keep the boss on an even higher course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of the White House , his first working day , he exhibited a major problem with President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , he appointed a major problem with President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , he would have fixed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad news that got into the hands of the President . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ing - because the president would make better choices if he would receive good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring their media skills .
President Tru@@ mp@@ s relationship on television dates back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; when Candi@@ mp was upset because of a fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places that were convinced , &quot; said the former election consultant Sam Nun@@ berg in February opposite to Poli@@ tico .
Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key to keep Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit in control , according to six former electoral campaign officials to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady lob@@ ster . &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter is ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridiculous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe this campaign investig@@ ators do something we don &apos;t know - that Tru@@ mp@@ s T@@ we@@ ets would have no more flu@@ ff without their interventions .
we probably will never know something about the twe@@ ets if the Tru@@ mp has not sent .
if his associates were to manage it a few times , to keep away from him , their efforts have been worth it .
but nobody has consistently able to avoid that Tru@@ mp &apos;s controversy creates .
a part of the problem is that people in a white house that unites itself from competing parties , repeatedly try to drive their own agenda by promoting Tru@@ mp material that possibly promotes their views from the world .
Poli@@ tico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ er to provide doub@@ t@@ ful information on the president for strategic reasons .
this was an example which was described by Reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp may respond to negative press sections , especially those who have sh@@ ame@@ ful le@@ aks , and that they will find out how they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly that happened at the end of February , when someone hit the President mali@@ cious a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ vocation Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy secretary of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a pile of le@@ ak in the White House .
although Johnson was held from Twitter permanently on Twitter or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that in the past he vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations and re@@ vo@@ ke them in the past .
Tru@@ mp read the article and started to ask staff about wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the Rec@@ ycle ram . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive Self , and his advis@@ er still strive for influence .
these un@@ changeable factors make the mission very difficult .
Me@@ ist@@ searched mur@@ s get the post of Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population is inv@@ oked and hoped for .
the police across Europe sent over this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous forms on the run .
as the addresses of the sought @-@ in abundance of nature are not known , indications made from the population are hoped and pray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action , which is followed by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calendar of winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences would have shown that many whis@@ pers hide from holiday places , it was on the part of Euro@@ pol .
you have assembled 21 post@@ cards for selected criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , it has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , which was more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online requested files have so far been arrested , at least eleven of them due to indications of the publication on the website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are again negotiated with some compens@@ ative travelers at war trees that have negotiated some of the church in tow@@ ed dit@@ ch to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the travellers have parked their 20 caravan on a field outside a prosperous road from Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and an army of transport , after they were ki@@ cked out only in May , without being de@@ ported from the Council of excav@@ ated dig@@ ging to prevent their attacks .
the tactical group found a gap in the defensive systems and expressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ ted to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; waste residents have printed the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous habit@@ ant said , &quot; They were moved on Monday night after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones at the pas@@ sers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced by step into action , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were moved in May , where they were moved and are now back again .
more came yesterday evening , probably more today . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to handle them by holding long sub@@ missions to protect their parks .
I live on Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my community dest@@ ep@@ ts when the council cannot stop once . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a inhabitants who did not want to be called , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is ridiculous , we have just been watching the last round of these travelers just to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the figures have this time increased and one even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot;
a spokes@@ person in the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to allow them to continue as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to support our demonstration , it is very important that as many people make a anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by invo@@ ke 101 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the judgment must prove , when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Birken@@ hof is a Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ ch is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house at the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is being renovated and is scheduled to be re@@ opened on March 1 next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the hotel bir@@ ch guided by the then ambi@@ ance operating company mbH and 13 April 2014 , the time went up around 30 000 nights per year and also revenues of tourist tax .
in autumn 2014 , in the light of the figures for refugees who arrived in the County , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation , which cat@@ ered for controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to safeguard the area as a hotel location .
at that time the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time .
but especially the Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Ober@@ bourgeois master Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke already then of serious interested parties in the house .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ tow hotels with business @-@ run Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer was acquired with a voluntary auction house in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of three @-@ star @-@ Plus Categ@@ ory under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter building .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ chi@@ al .
you hot hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ tow park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ ch@@ hof are ready for a long time building container in front of the entrance and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renovation works are made .
the so@@ ils were ri@@ pped out , blankets to some extent , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a beautiful hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspapers .
everything is to be renewed in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are built in .
everything was later &quot; beautiful bourgeois @-@ close , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment .
it would not stand on the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bath , but already at an up@@ scale downtown level , acc@@ entu@@ ates cas@@ erer .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms will set up a wide range , explains everything .
both individual holiday makers , groups or business@@ men should feel at home in their hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ se@@ wald and tourism direct Michael Kr@@ ause , he has already led , so Sch@@ erer .
the ideas of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investment needed , Thomas Sch@@ erer will not want to specify exactly .
less than a million euros , he reck@@ ons .
also the exterior facilities are brought on front , this is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , there is a large terrace that will be accessible from the restaurant , which is publicly available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : us @-@ Special , the Grand Jury consists of
in Russia @-@ affair to US @-@ President Donald Tru@@ mp , Robert Mu@@ eller should have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury for Robert Mu@@ eller .
the Panel has included the work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; under vocation with the cause of familiar persons .
the newspaper reviewed the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller extended his investigation and intensified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CN@@ N &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported the first pre @-@ inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ et in connection with a meeting between the Tru@@ mp@@ s al son and a Russian lawyer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
us intelligence agencies acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin since a long time being re@@ mixed in the presidential term in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller studied whether they were talking between the Tru@@ mp@@ s election team and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigation , several men are to stand , acting in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republi@@ can .
on the other hand , Mu@@ eller also took more and more Tru@@ mp@@ s private and commercial environment under the lens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote some weeks ago that the special officer Tru@@ mp has personally moved to the centre and seek to search for whether the president has hin@@ dered the judiciary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main task of Grand j@@ uries is to check and decide the evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether prosecution should be charged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Grand j@@ uries are therefore also called dock .
mostly they are turned on when it is bigger and controversial .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be switched on by the Public Pro@@ secutor to invite people to support under E@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N &apos;s station , prior inv@@ itations were already exhibited , which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
those who were involved in meeting were asked to a statement which was called in the report .
furthermore , they should provide documents .
next to Tru@@ mp J@@ r. also were Tru@@ mp@@ s advis@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ers as well as his dam@@ alist election director Paul Man@@ a@@ fort@@ . in the interview with us .
legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the installation show that Mu@@ eller won &apos;t let him be timi@@ d in his work and that he should be necessary to act fast .
however , it would not mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on in the end to decide on the collection of an indictment .
nevertheless , the suspension of the committee for the beginning of a new phase in investigations , and a new reason for concern for President Tru@@ mp .
in the midst of the new revelations , the President on Thursday evening used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russia @-@ story is a complete invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the issue gives the Democrats a way to feel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advis@@ ors T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in an opinion which is nothing about the suspension of a Grand Jury .
but this also works usually in secret , he emphasized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advocate all measures that accelerated the work of the Special agent in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former F@@ BI manager James Com@@ ey said three times that not to be determined against the president .
there is no reason to suppose that something changed because it was in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller had only been deployed after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this R@@ aus@@ fs , alleg@@ ations were hoo@@ ked out to Tru@@ mp , he wanted to hin@@ der the judiciary .
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp asked him to be asked for an adjustment of investigations against the then national security advisor Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
according to the representation of U.S. media , the White House gathered material against the special officer and its employees .
the most effective spec@@ ulations whether gu@@ mp Mu@@ eller would be released .
different from an independent special occasion of the congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , the President Richard Ni@@ xon , has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the margins of the President of the Justice of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to bend one such step but for@@ ging .
two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic transm@@ it@@ ators re@@ fra@@ yed on Thursday , according to which the Special Representative could no longer be released as easy .
Antar@@ ctic : giant ice@@ berg drive in the Antar@@ ctic
in the West@@ ant@@ ar@@ ctic , a giant ice@@ berg has solved itself from the barely four @-@ fold size of Berlin from the swe@@ eps .
this distributed the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institut für Polar@@ - und marine research on Wednesday .
the over a tri@@ l@@ lion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square @-@ square kilometers are now driving north and probably will need two , three years until he is mel@@ ted .
it is with 175 kilometres long and a width of up to 50 kilometres , one of the largest of the ice@@ berg that have registered in the past three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
how far climate change has played a role in the demo@@ lition of the ice@@ berg is unclear .
since around 30 years , however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s of ice @-@ monkeys in the region , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in one fact .
according to many researchers , this can also be connected to global warming .
the now un@@ broken collagen was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it continues to grow faster into the sea and regularly breaks down .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula .
just north of this swe@@ ar region was the balance of wa@@ xing and ab@@ ort a couple of years ago .
a complete sm@@ el@@ fe@@ is was dis@@ integrating there , AW@@ I researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes .
it also means a lot to do that even the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sh@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , as the more serious c@@ rested has not as far withdrawn as currently .
in addition , the iron plate can be found under tension and can be dis@@ bur@@ dened , if at a key point , a piece of dro@@ p@@ down .
the m@@ elt from Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ i and ice@@ berg are not the sea level because they swim on the water and pushed out to ice as much water as it results in the m@@ elt itself .
however , the loss of the skir@@ mis@@ hes also leads that the glacier can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in the low degree , the British research project reports to the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( MID@@ AS ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is according to AW@@ I information with almost 50 000 square kilometers is the four @-@ biggest che@@ el@@ ab@@ is of Antar@@ c@@ tica .
at the passage from the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters .
there it regularly breaks down .
&quot; although it is a natural procedure and has no direct connection to climate change , the ice sign comes now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; this is the widest retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; confirmed also .
under scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is will now be growing again or in the long run , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even if this researchers did not bring the demo@@ lition of this gigantic ice@@ berg to climate change , so many ice @-@ nu@@ is@@ les of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula are cru@@ mb@@ led in the past decades .
this long ornam@@ ental of the Antar@@ c@@ tica covers the direction of South America .
according to data from the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey is the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula since the 1950s , decreased by 28 000 square kilometers .
the decline have contributed to the temperature of temperature .
the Antar@@ ctic peninsula has grown in the past 50 years by around three degrees and t@@ amed with it to the areas where the temperature is fastest .
CD@@ U wants home @-@ if at the staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to seize free bodies , the CD@@ U calls to step out of the Emplo@@ yers Federation to step more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the Kre@@ ist@@ ag has won 41 new positions in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the administrative office in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now have 17 trainees of their first working day .
the teachers in the circle are obviously very popular .
some 6@@ 20 applications were recorded for the seats in this year .
nevertheless , the circle still lacks personnel to cope with the raised requirements and tasks .
at present , there are still 50 occupied positions in the circle M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as the forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U now intends to jointly take the initiative with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and to oppose the initiative and the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
the administration is intended to create a concept for human resources and personnel development according to the needs of the parties . &quot;
the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term needs of specialists , but forward @-@ looking the application cru@@ mb@@ ness , it is said .
the overall concept should be oriented towards the inside and outside , show concrete measures for cross @-@ entran@@ ts and involve an exemplary offensive , call CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this already sounds a good approach .
because the circle has it with staff problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is run by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of the public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes a high number of employees , which re@@ jects disease or age @-@ related causes .
it is high time for action so that no more places will remain un@@ occupied .
yet Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ ths , Leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party .
he had long ago been employed in Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a lazy surprise when he presented the recruitment into question publicly and pu@@ ff@@ ered the other parties .
people would like all the ways that all possibilities will be verified to provide an exit from the local employer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfying solution here in short notice , the county administration with the unions - perhaps even in collaboration with the urban towns - should seek a Hau@@ star@@ if &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U tries to pay the employees and officials better than the collective bar@@ gain for the public service actually fores@@ ees .
the sal@@ aries are currently less prescribed , elev@@ ations , or more money there are only when one changes to a higher level , which is oriented toward employment years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitutes .
last but not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers , Mr. Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direc@@ torate Martin Richter has a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tough@@ ens the tone into NGO migrants &apos; li@@ f@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has also warned that the li@@ f@@ ables for migrants in the Mediterranean are warned that they do not continue to continue , if they do not stick to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new Code of Conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; said Minister of Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; youth Ret@@ t &apos; , because their team had worked effectively with men &apos;s hands in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .
the aid organisation , which has been in operation only for a year , refused to express itself with the Italian pro@@ secutor of Am@@ bro@@ gio Carto@@ sio .
&quot; for us , saving of the human life is our upper@@ most priority . so we are sorry that in the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; the organisation said in an opinion on social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only assess all alleg@@ ations that are currently being raised , after we all have collected information and assessing the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had the boat of &apos; youth Ret@@ t &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , supervised since October .
it is assumed that its occupation of the din@@ gh@@ y migrants would take on board , that they can be delivered directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that the s@@ mug@@ gler @-@ ers can drive , so that ships can be used again .
at least one such coincidence , just 1,3 miles left off the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the pro@@ secutor of the pro@@ secutor , whose content was published by Italian media .
the crew is suspected of the authority of the Italian coastal guard to mi@@ tig@@ ate rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other moti@@ fs .
under the Code of Conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta have to operate in particular one of the Italian officials who supervis@@ es their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been explained to hold on the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be accepted as unnecessary but acceptable , as they would not be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates organization has without limits ( MS@@ F ) .
Minn@@ iti , meanwhile , said that the number of migrants arrived in Italy after the rescue operations in Italy , has declined in recent weeks , making efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local citizens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
An@@ ch@@ illas and Tri@@ als
nine women &apos;s bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berlin out@@ posts &quot; and two guest @-@ drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North @-@ Palat@@ inate , in order to enjoy four days long Tri@@ als and points of interest .
there were 3 friendly guides available to this guide .
the vacation rental in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ inn@@ est from Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour conducted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards for the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
it followed lookout spots , partly to towers , from which one could look far over the Pf@@ al@@ zer forest and the vor@@ ed levels .
in between there was a longer period of pon@@ ti@@ ring for the long trial .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim for the Sal@@ ine and the People &apos;s feast .
again , outlook point to the view point , connected by &quot; flo@@ ppy , &quot; Tri@@ als , and moderate An@@ c@@ ages .
in the last two days many al@@ timeter were cancelled .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and tur@@ ne@@ at@@ ts brought with welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim at@@ me@@ ars the bi@@ kers in the open @-@ air @-@ truste@@ e br@@ ist@@ br@@ ine .
also Neu@@ stadt has been controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres ascent , the group had discovered the Pf@@ al@@ zer forest at its best - sporty and culturally .
console instead of tur@@ f - Bundesliga are hosted for e @-@ sport
sitting the sport @-@ stars in the future face computer consoles , instead of going through with wind and weather over the stadium race ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long become a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high passages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also has recognised the first federal states that are increasingly involved in this field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , followed by the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , followed later by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded the mid @-@ July an e @-@ sport department and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract .
&quot; we hope to get quite new young audiences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO of Jo@@ chen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is certain that there are several associations in this move . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the upcoming weekend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Football Club World Cup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is organizing the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the gam@@ er of various clubs can compete against each other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , such as Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V inv@@ hoven qualified .
also Robin Dut@@ y looks great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advises an agency for virtual ball@@ ers .
&quot; the real football needs to diver@@ ge itself in particular with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ old , that young people will still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the associations tried to capture every possible markets , especially the Asian .
with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract you could be even more often present on these markets online , than once a year to send the Federal Republic to Asia once a year .
what is it all about ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; with e @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; League Of Le@@ gends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or just the football simulation of FIFA on cont@@ ests . &quot; &quot; &quot;
long ago , as in normal sports also , well @-@ established , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and , 2006 , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the presentation is certainly normal .
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ous has long been faced with the question .
for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , e @-@ Sport is a sport because he is competitive and displaying a lot of biological and physical responses , which one can also find in classical sport - for example raised heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormonal changes .
furthermore , it need cognitive skills , a technical and tactical insight and a quick reaction capability .
professional gam@@ ers should not only be on the console , but also train their body and look out on the diet .
&quot; the f@@ itte Player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is getting more and more an issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to run on online gaming , and in the scene they fail the structures of classical sports .
scientists emphas@@ ise the scientists the high inclusive effect of e @-@ sport .
the players are travelling internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural barriers .
a study of corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) says the e @-@ sport a rapid growth ahead .
in 2016 , there has been 50 million euros to be implemented in Germany , mainly about advertising , sponsorship , and great tournaments .
sales at 130 million are expected to be at 130 million in three years .
against the barely 2.4 billion euros of the soccer league , this is little .
however , the e @-@ sport &apos; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants .
international are many countries already on .
large markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ Bas@@ ket@@ ball@@ ers Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez are participating in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ashton Kut@@ cher will invest in the e@@ Sport @-@ competitions of Uni@@ kr@@ n .
also in Europe is doing some things .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport has been introduced as a class , F@@ rob@@ ous says .
in the Netherlands and in France the soccer league from Dut@@ y has now ple@@ dged to set up a e @-@ sport department .
&quot; in the European comparison is Germany behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ CEO Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann .
only to fall in nostal@@ gia and to clarify the old times is no longer sufficient .
the aim is to keep the tradition of the association , but to align it with the modern market at the same time .
&quot; we are living in a digital world , &quot; says Dut@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there you cannot stick to it that only with football everything remains as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poison @-@ eggs - The egg alternatives to bo@@ iling and b@@ aking
the sc@@ andal over poison@@ ous eggs are now almost all federal states hit .

Michelle Carter , because of the texts , which Conrad Roy urged to su@@ icide ,
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she has encouraged her friend through texts and calls for su@@ icide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condemnation behind G@@ it@@ ters and five years have been exposed to currency .
Carter was sentenced in June because of neg@@ ligence kill@@ ings of Conrad Roy , which took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free to appeal .
she had been faced with a maximum of 20 years , but their representative ar@@ gues that both she and Mr Roy did believe in a psych@@ ic disease .
clo@@ th@@ ed in red pants and a cre@@ amy bl@@ ouse , Carter comes with tears in the eyes , with folded hand and down aligned eyes , when it was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions made Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the pro@@ secutor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they ended his life in order to make their own better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it has no responsibility taken &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown a venue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters At@@ tor@@ ney said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful circumstance that it de@@ pl@@ ore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said however , he did not find out that their &quot; age or maturity or even their cl@@ ergy a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a pro@@ secutor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day in which I mour@@ n &apos;t the loss of my beloved son .
I want him to be proud of me and how I handle all things . I try , despite all my pain , that we will be carrying out for eternity with us to be there for his sisters , &quot; it says there .
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , told that she would never be pro@@ secuted from the realization that she will never participate in the wedding of her brother or would be an aunt for his children .
&quot; no longer have this only person to have with whom I have been together since my birth , is a pain that I always stay with me for the rest of my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to put a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to impose another , su@@ icide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy found dead of a carbon dioxide in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case drew national attention to himself , after Car@@ rier reports revealed that she had encouraged him to stop his life .
&quot; s@@ ke@@ g you up , spring of a building , make yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she had sent over the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his su@@ icide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything you have to do is switch the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told that Carter bes@@ ought attention by the death of Roy and orda@@ ined that they ought to benefit by any press of the case .
the case has the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Carter , Amanda Kno@@ x , who was sentenced in 2007 for murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted against two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times comment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Carter deserve sympathy and assistance , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learn from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua meets me at the Audi Cup as captain was no coincidence .
the FC Bayern chose the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner a large season to - extra motivation is not bl@@ ending .
anything was different from his place in the cabin , that looked Joshua Kim@@ ber@@ me immediately , even when the extra gar@@ ment was very , very small .
but since far and wide at the second day of Audi C@@ ups , there was of course no Philip Ach@@ m and also no Manuel Neu@@ er to see , he made himself the band@@ age to his arm .
&quot; the coach did not announce it , &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first deployment to Bavaria @-@ captain .
good , the entrance could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of the coach could also suggest me this way .
not the eight years older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was in the youth game , Deb@@ ut@@ ants and just returned from vacation experienced professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a game leader , but he .
added su@@ gars are most ad@@ orable to those who have a lot of herb that you want to keep in humor .
those who are chosen , to establish the heritage of L@@ ame , can use a small Extra motivation only good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as a mini @-@ l@@ ame is over the field .
right behind , this is its position , the white wound on the arm did its rest .
and at all k@@ im@@ min@@ ates me in this view de@@ formation like the one who can take the helm again into the hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ played troops .
he had the view of the whole , while many others were occupied with himself .
Vid@@ al thus , to super@@ vise his missing fitness ( folding hardly ) ; Renato San@@ ch to tie the performances of the Asia @-@ trip ( folding also only because ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le prevented his first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t not negative .
all at all went well .
South was running apart from Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy before the defense , both agi@@ cally sovereign .
the n@@ aci@@ ously occupied Nap@@ oli storm was very heavy , and also tried to succeed in playing a few times also in the game @-@ up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy was that the result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wasn &apos;t as we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but even he also showed his debut a decent performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , temp@@ o change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as un@@ usually this Bayern world is still looking for the newest version , then you saw following the game .
Ru@@ dy for example was in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs not one or two but determines six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ me , after a few cris@@ p @-@ pointed statements in the backs of his new fellow @-@ players .
there , he heard about an interesting phrase at the south : &quot; what is going on here , I have already seen .
with Bayern you just have to win any game . &quot;
after all , he does not have to teach the new one more .
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
Austrian known foot@@ b@@ aller has been reported shortly before the game via Twitter and asked the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies all the best .
the Bayern allo@@ on@@ aire is a quasi @-@ colony of oils from Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ captain in beak and fie@@ bert with our Lad@@ in .
the twe@@ et of the Austrian football matches of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motiv@@ ating sp@@ lash .
the famous Bayern Du@@ sel could possibly need our ladies as well .
company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ isches Minister : Wirtschaft pra@@ ises Wis@@ ła temp@@ o
there is often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still the economic leader of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this is demonstrated by more than one year , in which the new Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and businesses from the region speak to T V @-@ inquiry from a change in economic policy - and bl@@ ames the old prime minister at the same time .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ er Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing takes up the desires of the economy blocked the Lem@@ uria . &quot;
the biggest turn@@ around sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the mosquito control of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stands in the primary list of the country at the top .
still this year the Ministry is hoping to be a schedul@@ ing process until 2005 the building should be right .
a role in the plans of the country is also playing the west @-@ in Tri@@ er , which stands in the urgent need for the Federal Convention .
the aim is to take the route in December 2020 in operation , says Secretary @-@ speaker in Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees it a sign@@ post to support regional , but international competing enterprises .
the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Tri@@ er strives to use a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate Label in the wine to increase the sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of the German Wine exports for the past ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing have an open ear for people who want to start up their own firm , the I@@ HK mines .
the Handwerk@@ skammer Tri@@ er sees in the new master bonus a added incentive for young apprentic@@ es , says managing director Matthias Schwal@@ bach .
provided is a premium of 1000 euro for the inspec@@ ti@@ examination of some 2,500 euros , if graduates do not own within ten years after the performance .
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
with the planned road building , they are quick facts to create , at the same time fail the country at the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Haupt@@ sponsor der I@@ HK Tri@@ er .
of 56 new engineers , trying to adjust the bis@@ sing of the state mobility , have so far been occupied 29 places .
the Chamber of Industry calls for more orders to external offices .
CD@@ U @-@ presidents Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the business station , the country invested more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of inland roads in 2017 .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
to further expand the previous broad@@ band design in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had evaluated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with the note 3.4 .
they are interested in sc@@ aling Internet connections and break@@ downs .
in contrast , ex @-@ economic Minister for E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the wind power station Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke for April to be President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where after four months it has already been d@@ ashed the field after four months .
Audi is supposed to change 2@@ 80@@ ,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would offer the software to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
the BMW president said , the company was the opinion that &quot; it was more smar@@ ter options than @-@ restricted options , &quot; and related to European cities - including Munich where BMW is located - to ban or limit diesel vehicles .
Daimler was announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European car manufacturers have promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des , the diesel engines , are considered to be car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of autom@@ obil@@ es , equipment for neutr@@ alising the off of diesel vehicles has to install , take also to what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful car companies and ignore signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen to regulate the use of so @-@ called de@@ preci@@ ation devices , emissions regulate in order to comply with the rules if a car was tested , but return to normal driving conditions .
in the United States several employees have been indicted by Volkswagen , others are being examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in Germany &apos;s engine development .
the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and therefore is not protected from delivery and could be brought to justice in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was included in German criminal investigation in Volkswagen after having been accused of Audi to have installed a system to circum@@ vent E@@ mission limits in Europe and a request that focused on the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inclusion of Audi into the research could be heavy burden : the luxury car manufacturer has to increase in proportion to the benefit of Volkswagen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this message has the raft on Saturday on the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect Is@@ ar .
so that the Is@@ ar visitors join it , a raft drive a raft in Munich on the morning of tomorrow that has a special message .
to get to the Is@@ ar on Saturday there will be a big flo@@ ppy there between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ bridge .
and that is not a nasty raft , with Is@@ ar @-@ tourists .
but the building &apos;s abstract wants to clarify .
on the raft you can see a big in@@ otran@@ ser@@ ent .
it shows a trash .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a public service campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitor .
with the motto &quot; True love &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar sharp@@ ens to be protected as a protective flow . &quot;
even during the last summer , the raft across the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and eco @-@ conscious behaviour .
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ en@@ asen and the laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was temporarily one of the most known carto@@ ons of carto@@ on@@ ists , the n@@ oll@@ enn@@ es of his figures are his trademark .
even with 85 the Argent@@ inian still features and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : to laugh , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ er@@ mo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born August 4 , 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first few years as an artist he was relie@@ ved of himself as an artist for luck , who made him earlier .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris at the end of the &apos; 60s made the breakthrough : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo discovered many fans .
again and again the artist of cities inspire .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures , in drawings with the shooting tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he was still sitting at the char@@ table today , and works nearly ten hours a day .
about calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts and watches and watches , his dro@@ ll figures continue to find much distribution worldwide .
he has also been working on a drawing movie and a TV show with his figures for six years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the main person in the movie &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crazy Island &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los popular animal in his drawings - who has a thou@@ sand@@ b@@ bed as a counter @-@ player . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time his figures speak in the 3D film , from 2019 on the movie screen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what they are saying , it is strange for me &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
therefore , it is related to the TV series , which , as its original desig@@ nations , password is produced .
la@@ ven@@ der is threatened from Provence
it became a symbol of Provence in the south of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is because of the lack of dro@@ ught , and due to the illnesses of the insects declined , which scientists and farmers trying to find solutions to find great headaches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert on the estate research institution , CR@@ IE@@ PP@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively jeop@@ ardi@@ zed because the plant in recent years has been exposed to impacts of climate change , which resulted in the spring much less rain and in autumn much more .
this has effects on the life of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small gyp@@ sum , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the d@@ warf @-@ cla@@ ve , and in very dry weather , there are many of it . &quot;
and there is much at stake .
la@@ ven@@ der oil l@@ ures not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very popular for perf@@ um@@ ers and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ m said : &quot; instead of having very long crop drilling with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with etheric oil . &quot;
among the solutions that are considered , include better water@@ distribution and the slow@@ ing of ev@@ ap@@ oration of the ground , but also the audi@@ ting of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water , and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dry .

Fes@@ th@@ ö@@ he@@ point is this Saturday and Sunday with a medi@@ a@@ eval day .
Kra@@ emer , Z@@ ün@@ ster , merchants , vag@@ ant or a country storage camp should be at these days in the city center .
the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ scored the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce weekly meet , usually to meet their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt high officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about safety .
they told them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists will discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children to the office , which in 2009 have the target of an attack with Gran@@ ules , or leave them at home .
safety experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room : opponent , neutral , allies .
they ask the repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no proof is needed , perceptions and abdom@@ inal feelings .
there are drug trafficking , politicians , business@@ men , journalists , who are suspected to stand on the salary of the government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico be dangerous .
there is no rest period of violence , and throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses are frequent , more and more journalists are at least 25 , since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a Nie@@ to in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are standing after attacks and threats under German prot@@ ections and until now there was at least seven deaths in seven countries .
among the latter is her editor and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his many books on violence related to drugs .
its lack will be felt deep although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez which shows his mid@@ finger with the word &apos; Justice , &quot; depends on the façade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , bear T @-@ shirts , who show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ uth .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared topics , the trau@@ ma , its night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although in 2010 a Son@@ ja Office was established to deal with the crimes of journalists , these according to the Committee for the protection of journalists took only two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of kill@@ ings , each year associated with drug trafficking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .
in Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they are still working to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ trin@@ sic and even though the terrain is still wi@@ ped out .
without any information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting on the discussion of safety has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very silly to be wast@@ ing my time in this workshop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we do not know the Why , we mis@@ trust all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive only a couple of blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla has been stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ ve river . &quot;
the ri@@ cher drove in his car away and damaged it in the vicinity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to be free in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an freely .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the world &apos;s bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields to fight the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of mixed , two @-@ story st@@ ole@@ ans for drugs of drugs which are larger than many houses for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only a cardboard box has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading in the United States .
nevertheless and despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes there have contributed two mis@@ understandings to the murder .
first , in February the publication of a interview with Damascus Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival@@ ing cart@@ els in war with Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos;s sons .
this release may have anno@@ yed the sons &apos; anno@@ yed , projected revenue members bought every copy of the output as soon as it was delivered to newspaper @-@ publishers .
the second error was to force Val@@ dez to force Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of a different newspaper , which had released the same story to leave the country for its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues be@@ amed that he would always be there .
he was active in 2003 as experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este as he joined with five colleagues for the formation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the d@@ ow@@ ry problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation because of the bold and honest reporting , and revenues and advertising took .
repor@@ ters loved it , hard to publish hard excell@@ ency tests without fear of cens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the formation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for their reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage on the persecution of the Mexican drug history , wherever it led .
he voluntarily gave him that he was afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a lifestyle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ u@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you need to take on the task which you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would not want to be asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many life@@ times ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird who was able to ble@@ ak like a do@@ ck@@ workers , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
you trusted in his routine .
he would always bear his charge .
he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar across from the office , go there always sitting at the same table there .
now they ask , was his love to the routine of spo@@ il@@ age ?
his death has also forced them to question their own assumptions on how they can do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; they do not like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their c@@ anny and run@@ ways , &quot; to make drugs move .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high measure of self @-@ cens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ preservation .
your own instinc@@ ts trust .
if it smells wrong , stay away from it .
the trouble is , said the editor of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; smells like a sense that can be decei@@ ved ... and then the thing is happened with Javier . &quot;
the old rules , such as he and others say , are in Sin@@ alo@@ a no longer - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a poison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce arrived for security reasons , suddenly no mobile phones were allowed . days previously became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments for monitoring journalists and activ@@ ist in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking at the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the federal government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ class district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen who are the governor himself as un@@ trustworthy .
it is months since the re@@ porter went to the mountain landscape , where the drug ad@@ dictions have fallen in control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has built on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former known box@@ ers Julio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é with the government spending that concentrated on the hometown of the Govern@@ ors .
and there was a group running in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , one block from the office of the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s office .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it came to pass , so I was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug retailers and authorities .
a re@@ porter from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy maker , who ruled the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) , which ruled almost all the political levels almost all of the century .
recently several Pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of corruption because of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this e@@ at@@ ery , including one where a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man passed a military attack .
few months before the readers had seen the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about the discovery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we had already knew what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its slim body stat@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Val@@ dez &apos;s office was devoted to storage and sti@@ ckers that prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists who had become something they had never expected : activists in behalf of the press .
Re@@ por@@ ters Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez grab@@ bed a few signs and passed the next morning to a demonstration for another journalist at the office of the Pro@@ secutor .
Salvador Ad@@ amed disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is his .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the whole country journalists have become sound@@ proof that they have written in organized &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on wal@@ k@@ ways and constructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on that day the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a a day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez R@@ ami@@ rez the authorities , journalists to pi@@ ate and bring them to leave because they have said the truth .
she has since asked that she is re@@ divided by the government because she is concerned that its anger has violated its objectiv@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez has repeated repeatedly that journalists in Mexico from organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded by government officials and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; equal society &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killed by drugs , but also by politicians and security guards , with organized crime among a ceiling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Mexico @-@ minded you , because they want you to take the mouth , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez .
obviously the kill@@ ings have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border @-@ state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Z@@ etas @-@ Kart@@ ell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer @-@ stat@@ e@@ ur and headphones were located next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close , as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others will continue as there was El Man@@ ana from Nu@@ evo L@@ are@@ do after the assass@@ ination of their director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their homeland or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , like the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who had been murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue to stay and continue the work , it is a daily dance with risk @-@ risk choices .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once seemed a poet , is there that the drug trading terri@@ fied him .
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I re@@ porter , &quot; he said .
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat at the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer , when all their phones started .
a number of shooting ranges with band@@ reefs and security guards near the bath@@ or@@ tes Maz@@ at@@ lan had 19 confirmed deaths .
the war continues to escal@@ ate , as it was promised by a number of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the on @-@ board edge you have published the news on the web site of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce about mobile phones .
the front page had to be changed next day .
Sir@@ ens he@@ ul@@ tes close to - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen , the guards held to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid of all they did not show it .
under the vast portrait of the Fallen &apos;s founder , whose middle @-@ finger was visible to the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed its mark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just remember &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when the same day was murdered by Javier , the train@@ ee asked me to send it to the coverage of the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dinosau@@ r used to ev@@ ade its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , though a frigh@@ tening .
now , researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ ocer@@ os of a Canadian leader were so well preserved that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that she even could find that his puppy skin was of red@@ dish @-@ like Braun and they said she had had something from a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Cur@@ rent Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the self @-@ paid dinosau@@ r , who has ever been found and one of the best dinosau@@ rs specimens in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs , who lived in the middle of the Cre@@ t@@ ace@@ ous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his unbelie@@ v@@ ably well preserv@@ ative state has researchers who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ aters is the best preserved fossil species of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine close to Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada .
he met something which l@@ acked out of the surrounding cliffs , and resolved to see more specifically .
the Fossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years working to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) heavy me@@ zz@@ ling .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you can make only a little with the eyes flas@@ hes , you could almost believe it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum , where the creature has to be seen .
&quot; it &apos;s going to be in the History of History as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have found that this plant @-@ e@@ aters , although he is covered with a arm@@ or and resembles a changing shell , probably was threatened by meat @-@ man dinosau@@ rs .
the highly ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide from car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , and used a sealing technology known as a counter@@ balance , which is also used by many modern animals .
this could have been allowed to blend better into its surroundings and to ev@@ ade its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by bigger dinosau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs made headlines in May and is now at the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta with mit@@ ch@@ elli after the Muse@@ um@@ ele@@ techni@@ cian Mark Mitchell , one of a team who spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to discover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell , and an international team of scientists , the patterns and the form of scales and arm@@ or about his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sha@@ ding , a common defence method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ sha@@ ding is common , the results are surprising , since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is far beyond the animals living today .
it indicates that the dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by sufficient pressure due to meat @-@ resolution dinosau@@ rs , that evolution fav@@ oured the conce@@ al@@ ment of the confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sha@@ ding - think of deer , zeb@@ ras , or mar@@ ches @-@ animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , which sign@@ aled that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs was exposed to a true struggle for survival .
&quot; strong boot@@ able behavior on a massive , highly ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs demonstrate how dangerous the dinosau@@ rs beast of the Cre@@ t@@ ace@@ ous had to have been , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skins also shows that the skin of the dinosau@@ rs was mar@@ oon .
scientists continue to examine the animal upon information about his life , including his context @-@ fourth , to find out what it eaten as its last meal .
they believe that the dinosau@@ rs died when he died , driven into a river and went out into the sea where he sank on the back to the se@@ ab@@ ed .
at that time , Alberta was as warm as it was today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much farther inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ sh@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with consistent skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; the result is that the animal today looks almost like in the early chal@@ k season .
you do not need much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you &apos;re just a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is on sleep . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time , as giant sp@@ at@@ opo@@ den , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ rs , who were on two legs , the earth passed .
although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus rex , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ tive ancestors .
this belongs to the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , an 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Cur@@ rent Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was vers@@ had@@ owed after the death in the sea and in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine close to Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the self @-@ held dinosau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is entirely from the mu@@ zzle up to the hips .
the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3.000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch l@@ aces that ra@@ ined from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es was pushed by the Western Canada , until a flooded river flooded into the open sea .
but the sub@@ marine ti@@ redness of the dinosau@@ r kept his arm@@ or in an exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remn@@ ants of that special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cl@@ ums@@ y arm@@ oured panels along the dinosau@@ rs .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &quot; rare as a profit in a lot@@ to .
the more I see it , the more confusing it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied ti@@ te of the skin still cover the bump@@ y arm@@ or plate , which carry the sk@@ ull of the beast .
his right front is on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards .
I can count the scales at his sole .
in thunder@@ storm : mass kar@@ am@@ bol@@ days on A@@ 8 : many wounded
fierce accident on Thursday night on the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass @-@ cat@@ tery .
there are numerous wounded , mile @-@ long seals - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , 20 people have been injured during a mass kar@@ am@@ bol@@ age approximately 20 people .
according to the police at 5 : 00 p.m. , between the Connec@@ t@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm over 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , inter@@ locking .
regarding the exact number of closures initially no details were given .
it is about mild to medium severe injuries , said a pol@@ ishing @-@ pre@@ cher .
a large listing of b@@ ail@@ out vehicles was at the accident place .
the A@@ 8 was totally locked in direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich , there was some ten kilometres long relap@@ se .
like an AZ re@@ porter , there was also on the counter@@ road to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire@@ brig@@ ade notes out the hall@@ mark of the vehicle techni@@ cian who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
after 18 : 45 p.m. there was a second accident at A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
yet there was a collision between an auto @-@ otran@@ spor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a Res@@ cue @-@ Hel@@ icop@@ ter was on the road to the accident place .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once again : nothing escap@@ ing you sit on the train and sleeps .
or you go deep into his work and has just an in@@ geni@@ ous thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the cre@@ ek and ar@@ ouses an uns@@ an@@ gled or tear the passenger in the middle of the work@@ flow .
Tim@@ card control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn are currently tested the manage card card control .
one simply confirms the phone that one has taken its place and de@@ valu@@ ated the roadmap .
currently a test run is running on two tracks .
&quot; comes the offer , we expand it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will then be available at many further remote traffic routes in Germany early next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; calls the railway the card de@@ valuation with no guards .
in order to use the benefits , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to booked a on @-@ line ticket - which already do most passengers .
you also have to have bought it via the rail , the DB Navigator software , which is the most convenient way of getting ticket booking .
and finally you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works as follows : one climb@@ s to the train , calling its ticket to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the test customers then appears a button for electronic recovery .
the draw manager will receive a message on their mobile devices that the G@@ ast x is located on the train and has the booked seats Y .
comes the train@@ ee manager at the ticket checking in Square Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already delivering a worth@@ less on @-@ line ticket .
so one can continue to sleep , continue to keep quiet .
&quot; check in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the rail - which in turn should use the passengers .
&quot; who relax@@ es without ticket control through our train service staff , chec@@ kt in the DB Navigator is simply one .
this allows the passengers to make their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Management Board of DB ( DB ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to address the individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who often drives train , know that next to delays and pas@@ sions the ticket checks are one of the greatest doctors .
for often , in any case one of the fellow travelers do not receive all the documents that you need for the de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the ID card or else the document you must suggest .
as a result , endless discussions between mig@@ rating and riding ast , which leads to a bad mood in the event or Greater space and delays in control of your own tickets and take the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this also applies to the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same track are not yet un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist went to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was shaken to their nucleus .
just a day after having arrived in New York City , the people sat in St. Louis on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which they rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone .
you stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; says it there .
be@@ wil@@ dered as no one otherwise posted on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly saving on her tim@@ eline .
the m@@ apper out of the area of St. Louis was involved , the death of Michael Brown , a un@@ armed black 18 year old , who was killed by a white police in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed , live too twe@@ et .
he po@@ ised a picture of bro@@ w &apos;s naked body that was stretched on the road and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought Fer@@ rell at her .
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
they placed their cell phone to return later in the evening to twe@@ et about people on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of the police band and people , the cried , and by a man who claimed to be a sign with the wording : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ her police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they observed a live Fe@@ ed where a police officer stood before a group of prot@@ esters with a revol@@ ving dog .
in another video , she said , another poli@@ cem@@ an is his rif@@ le and cried , &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Fer@@ rell remembered her statement .
&quot; this is not the way of murder we have used to and which we can call it typical . &quot;
at this moment I felt scar@@ let .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
you booked a flight back and went home the next day .
after landing at 11 pm , she won her six @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinemas starting from 11 .
it is a history of survival and Protest@@ es , the love and the loss , the strength and resistance which , from the point of view of the human being , who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who carried a flower @-@ dress and a right crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminded of what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police have killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not bring them , &quot; Fer@@ rell said later .
&quot; what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it has to know it and it will see and be raised up .
it has to be well developed , not only milit@@ ism and organization , but also to know the different layers of the black and black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves .
even though I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally experienced no cl@@ ums@@ y racism , she is no different from the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have the feeling that I would have a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first stop , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which was raised to a Camp@@ site than the activists representing the possible non @-@ trial of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rell and her daughter were associated with a local business owner .
they prepared bags before and helped to pass them on prot@@ esters .
slowly , a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for the dent form .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after the 9th August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ souri Saint Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and concentrated on food justice and health inequalities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has all come . &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rell met during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar only wanted to document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a question came Fer@@ rell in the meaning : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can take advantage of ? &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished through countless cases of people , often from White - in a community that benefited from their pain and resili@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and grew up in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and we did not want to run their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the Co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field , which is known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt occup@@ ants .
his commitment brought the project closer to the project , along with six other indigenous people followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years following browsers .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we talk , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me , how these people are presented , because I will be shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was to concentrate on fer@@ ential experience - to show that it &apos;s the movement &quot; not about a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but about a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she turned out to be the most obvious in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ells Life , as she loves and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like nude , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability on this work and for the human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ ells tells history the role of the black gay men in the wider Black @-@ lives @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founder of the movement , which after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ from Martin in 2012 have marked the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have supported the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the main load of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it ins@@ ists that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rell was chosen as the heart of the film .
&quot; she was the person who infl@@ ated this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; it &apos;s not a coincidence , although it was at the front line because with a life on these crosses as a black , gay woman is so much at stake .
you can feel your energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial links between the municipality and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway in a demonstration .
it describes the social @-@ political atmosphere of the area they call their home : &quot; a mess . &quot;
nevertheless , they cl@@ inging to a chant , and she feels committed to that memory , since she went into the street three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV readers discuss more than bit @-@ gallery
the bit @-@ gallery moves the people , although it is not built for a long time .
but the idea of a mall at the crossing of the pedestrian zone spl@@ its the population in advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
cold leaves the subject barely any .
also on our Facebook page &quot; People &apos;s Liber@@ al and Bit@@ burg &quot; the topic is discussed .
while the one to say @-@ in @-@ gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; That would be genuine &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; does not need man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi ) or simply plain : &quot; scale @-@ line ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) .
while the advocates are setting that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , of which the rest of the shops can profit , fear the enemies , that the pedestrian prec@@ inct Ell@@ wan@@ gen .
added : the gallery is planned exactly on the property , where the market hall is market , in which 13 direct marke@@ ters can provide their products .
with the beginning of construction work it will be concluded .
the gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall into new building - and there is a view to the Be@@ da Square and sitting outside .
Simone Zimmer : &quot; we have been shopping nearly weekly on the market market for many years .
mostly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of land women again and again very willingly .
even the but@@ cher &apos;s shop we have discovered for us too .
we would like to hear that , during and above all , after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ensing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the height of the rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva Kili@@ c : &quot; what shopping palaces in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dro@@ p@@ s- or supermarkets : I find that su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are plenty of that in our city .
you see how many stores of cargo shops are empty here - some have been here for months and years .
but since it is not even a proper weekly market there , it &apos;s all the more important that at least the market hall remain .
after all , the goods offered here is fresh , is mainly offered directly from the manufacturer and is ob@@ end@@ able reasonably priced .
as you can see , stores will be located in a shopping center only by major companies , as the dor@@ sal rents are often un@@ portable to a retailer .
too bad , specialty shops are almost no longer there and that which still exists , will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ als : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit me together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where is the farmers market hall during construction time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even when the bit Gallery is actually coming .
or does it manage to exp@@ el all business from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this simply does not work .
and a shopping center that stands empty even nobody needs .
in my view , it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery .
but for a peasant market hall , yes , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no place any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the farmers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; market hall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is initiated , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an appropriate similarity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost in@@ sensitive - which hung out of the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ s and hair cuts that were sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison of Fort Le@@ aven@@ ow , where the former secret service analy@@ st had an 35 @-@ year @-@ old prison sentence , after having been secretly sprin@@ ting diplomatic reports on the Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is A Be@@ coming St@@ blan@@ ce ( An appropriate similarity ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline coinci@@ ded its expertise in technology , computer sciences and arts , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ vers@@ um , and the proph@@ es@@ ick , whose condemnation of Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorithm analysis of DNA that could look for Mann@@ ing , and from the 30 portraits , such as some intellectual comment might not only be the form@@ ability of DNA @-@ data - the many mod@@ alities as they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also to identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has been openly spoken about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was condemned in 2013 for 20 accus@@ ations , including six violations of the Spi@@ ary Act , computer @-@ fraud and theft .
through the prison , her image was sup@@ pressed , so much that there was only one photo - a liqu@@ or , black @-@ white self @-@ color , in which Mann@@ ing is obviously sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ blonde per@@ for@@ ks carries - with which it was associated .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of her 2012 @-@ Project &apos; stranger &apos; .
they produced the artist &apos;s portraits of strangers of for@@ ens@@ ic arti@@ facts like cigarette mu@@ ff@@ um and chew@@ ing g@@ um , by extraction the DNA out of the waste to create an image of how these people could look .
this was the time when it received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper mag@@ azin .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg with a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she was not able to visit this time and she could not be photographed , so you took contact with Chelsea , and in@@ quired if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ n@@ ated M@@ use were sent to in@@ comparable letters that received several letters over the course of two years .
they even created one of Sho@@ a Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated Com@@ pressed images , &quot; which was fores@@ een to convert a future in which the president would be converted into a sentence and would be able to see the exhibition in person .
that Obama was indeed only a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ing release after seven brutal years would demand in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome kind of happ@@ i@@ est coincidence .
there is even now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender forces , to find new , twe@@ et ways to get the rigid divisions which he actually should fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , after the wei@@ rd timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a reason . &quot;
in a written art statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing with their over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in their surname is provided with a heart ) an end of &apos; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis is sex , race , sexuality and culture . &quot;
in opposite wall her mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence is a genius of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped , through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or Nu@@ kle@@ o@@ tide after the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pedia of the artist ) show how amazing , at least in bi@@ ologically speaking , we are all .
&quot; what people hopefully will take with us is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , also to be seen .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition that is stored in an own space is a page from above mentioned Com@@ ic @-@ No@@ vel@@ le .
she shows Mann@@ ing , as it appears with a rob@@ bery @-@ ef@@ on in the hand from the discipl@@ in@@ arity of the United States as King Kong .
&quot; if they got your speech , then they have won , &quot; says it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came right from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who spoke out of Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get goo@@ se@@ bump@@ s when I talk about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not personally seen the exhibition - as it was pres@@ cient in the com@@ ic book - but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the space by the masks , by their own genom@@ ic sim@@ ul@@ ls who com@@ prise as hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
it was also target @-@ oriented , as everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , where their genetic pants with pencil had been written .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to be like a mass movement , that formed with Chelsea , like the movement , which also hidden behind their liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford because of their killing .
a nationwide human hunt has been underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who had been looking for suspi@@ cious money after a man had been sto@@ cked in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injury .
on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ o ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ t was issued on account of her alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau , as the acts of the allegedly office of the Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau , 26 , after several styles died .
one from the police authority of Chicago released un@@ realized war@@ n@@ system states that the cor@@ pse was discovered on July 27 .
officials got a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injury to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau was still declared dead at the location of the action for dead , and det@@ ective examine the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively searching for the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
La@@ o has been an extraordinary professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice President for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ o has now been judged abroad and was excluded from entering the campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; this is now a criminal matter examined by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University co@@ operates at this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ bage .
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ man at the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help the U.S. investigation authorities in every conceivable way . &quot;
the statement also imp@@ lied that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were shocked and want him to be .
Chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he urged the susp@@ ects firmly to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have a concept of their where@@ ab@@ outs and our efforts to loc@@ alise them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building that had just received a mysterious tip that had just happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as a very cruel one .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ o and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victims had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the inhabitants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the time axis and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the W@@ ada @-@ roadmap in the near future &quot; - the Russian Vice ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
the Russian deputy prime Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said , it won &apos;t be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ dop@@ ing ) .
the W@@ ada timetable was updated in this respect , &quot; stated Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented the second part of the roadmap of W@@ ada on compliance with the Code , which describes the criteria for the re @-@ establishment of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause matters to Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added .
however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list is determined that the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the UN approved investigation by Canadian Prime Minister Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren .
regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we conduct the investigation as our anti @-@ D@@ oping system has been trying to conce@@ de an error .
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not admit to something which does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ ual words voted with those of Vit@@ aly S@@ mir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission .
in discussion with the Russian sales office R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day , S@@ mir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report has controversial positions and regulations .
nobody has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; S@@ mir@@ nov .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the wake of the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal from the W@@ ada on the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ dop@@ ing ( UK@@ AD ) .
after visiting the main artist of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ada @-@ Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moving in the right direction , to be used again .

however , only eggs are likely to be supplied to Al@@ di who have been tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ hal@@ low anti @-@ L@@ ubs .

the start @-@ ups that will help your organization to become not the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ re@@ tt did not want to measure luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not function .
answers were often v@@ ague , very helpful or - worse - che@@ ating .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers were not griev@@ ing .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objectiv@@ ity , &quot; said Er@@ re@@ tt , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce H@@ air Care Society Ma@@ dison Reed .
it has called people from the outside to help .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on the wa@@ xing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it enables companies to provide surveys , specification groups and demographic groups to offer employees anonym@@ ity and complaint @-@ lines , and in some cases wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to byp@@ ass C @-@ Suite managers and directly turn to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ Bit for the pursuit of its health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools used by companies to compete with employees .
Er@@ re@@ tt said that she did a better idea of what your employees think and feel at G@@ lin@@ t in the three years .
in addition to S@@ nap @-@ surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers an heat @-@ card of the company , which indicates a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low allocation results - so you can drill out why .
companies come to see that at the head of the workplace culture must stay , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber that has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als , since a former employee has published a blog post which describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ings , in which those who have spoken .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t this desire for an overview is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility .
the global governance , regulation and Compliance @-@ branch could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , following the bud@@ get@@ ary technical website Let &apos;s talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize poor behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ all in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
conver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ ters can send custom @-@ made &quot; Pul@@ led &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and regard the warmth @-@ maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hotline , with which employees can report a bad behaviour .
and if the main business guide is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has seized the regul@@ ators &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that its employees are badly treated or is un@@ ethical , it can experience precious consequences due to consumers and boy@@ cott , workers &quot; fluctu@@ ation and law@@ suits , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Quin@@ lan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has used Conver@@ ters for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of politicians and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
previously , if a employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to submit a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a intimi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said there was no good way to pursue the complaints of his staff .
well , as the company res@@ cent , using Conver@@ ters , can be hidden problems , which were previously hidden by executives , who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or il@@ legitimate internship , identified and addressed .
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 degree view in the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , which direc@@ ts the risk management Group from Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders in employment law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
company began to take ethics , values and co @-@ workers commitment in 2002 to take after the accounting company Arthur Andersen due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Quin@@ lan .
but it lasted until the &quot; social media &quot; occurred to their right , &quot; that companies recognised that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ ters offer your software as a service , and do charge the company with recurring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will have the approval of Venture Capital investors , who have both start @-@ ups supported .
conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February by companies such as S@@ apphire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , making the total capital raised to $ 47 million .
they increased $ 10 million in November by Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners , bringing its entire funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees are more expecting their jobs than before .
competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects on w@@ agers .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to feel at a company that belongs to their voices and that the work that you do is worth to make this company successfully , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience on Lin@@ ke@@ d@@ In , who used both Conver@@ ters and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors reach Ren@@ di@@ tes , if their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise , commitment and use of the employees will increase , it &apos;s no wonder you will find support .
the data on staff commitment to experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrator of a company does not take action .
indeed , if a company asks employee about your feedback , it may have an expectation that changes are on the way .
and if the changes are not fast enough , or not at all , these dis@@ appointments can be lab@@ elled and provided .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ st International , the company has seen himself too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow the staff to ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have you really listened to ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
and whom do you not worry about why should I ? &quot;
Ma@@ dison Reed , who now performs monthly staff surveys , was able to initiate action on the same day if a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t , says Er@@ re@@ tt .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ating employees it was possible to re@@ organize several teams in the company through the speed of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , to organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems .
in Ruby Tuesday , the company will always receive new insights on the employees , and it hopes that in the long term , this leads to a better attachment of workers in a industry that is known for high revenues .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customer .
and if you lose customers then you will lose business .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the brood
there is a lot of U@@ CL@@ A Foot@@ ball@@ ads on one side of the new exercise areas of the team at the campus .
some have moved out their tri@@ pod ou@@ ghs and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team this kind of lunch is a lunch break .
players who are ins@@ cribed to the summer courses , will return after the three @-@ hour exercise to their final test , before they return next morning at 6 : 30 o &apos;clock to the water@@ man Football Center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real tre@@ ad@@ mill for the guys next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a before Monday to Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminated two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players and she has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ CL@@ A at 19 : 15 will start to meet the already packed schedules of the players .
the compromise reached from the two days is more than a day when the brood was moved to the beginning of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school , during the first time during Mor@@ as six hours in western wood .
you should stop in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 at the beginning of formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he support the amendment of the N@@ CA@@ A support , even if they add the multip@@ lied routes to the player to add another point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous load three or four days on it , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they have simply pushed it through , they re@@ plac@@ ements , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think we come until Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practices once the camp is terminated , as given the clear presence of its fields from a bor@@ dering parking and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ lifting class , which is already assigned with pedest@@ rians , which will be a protective grid behind a tor@@ p@@ fo@@ sten , no easy task will be .
Bru@@ ins @-@ players are intended to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a adm@@ its that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then adjust it to record an exercise .
if you have the video and from an exercise , it &apos;s a fairly good deal .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensify facts on the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports on the fact @-@ reviewed by third parties and then display their results under the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to combat so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News .
the company said in an opinion on its website , that it will begin with the use of updated machine methods to recognize possible false reports and send them to the fact audi@@ tor that may show results of the Fak@@ ten@@ examination from the original item .
Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the main points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , many of whom believe they have also influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .
the problem has become a major political issue in Europe , whereby the French voters in the run @-@ ahead of the presidential elections were flooded with false stories , and Germany supports a plan where social media networks are to be punished , if they didn &apos;t manage to remove the water @-@ filled post@@ ings as they did before the elections in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate explanation in German that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany started a test of the new facts .
&quot; in addition to the knowledge , which stories of the fact @-@ tested third parties are challenged , people want more space to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product man@@ ag@@ ress for Facebook news in a blog .
she added that Facebook continued to test his feature on the &quot; written article &quot; and works on other changes to his messages feeds in order to reduce false messages .
creating a com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past the small Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a squeeze video and was a lo@@ op@@ holes in the 1970 @-@ er and 1980 @-@ s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history in the Be@@ w@@ l River valley in K@@ ent and now has become inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says we@@ h@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families that lived in Scot@@ ney . Isaac Len@@ kie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Green@@ berg .
it is not the first book by Rhodes , which is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotional .
&quot; I only responded to the thum@@ b print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agen@@ ten in the 1700 @-@ 00@@ s who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thum@@ b pressure ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters are always transported to smoke ; for then they lit up a fire because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he were himself .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so with old Pap@@ ieren , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have survived my welcome treasure in a little &apos; ) , all this seems too beautiful to be true .
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Vic@@ t@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , seeing the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads at the walls and the bottles spent in the dit@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle , and talked to Land@@ s@@ care , gar@@ den@@ ers , and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and started writing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust got only in 2006 full access than the last one , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rhodes hit a decade later , the employees started to take care of the archive that he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristocr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , Cast it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English preferences , maps that had possessed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they could mean that land conflict would be boring , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought the two families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guys , let everything go its course ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to del@@ ving on the iter@@ er base in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; that leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmer &apos;s throw from 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record from a turmoil that came in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book called &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly El@@ der of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , Rhodes .
&quot; the farm was started in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start .
maybe the two are connected ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &quot; The Pri@@ est , &quot; who talks the history of the Jesu@@ it Plan@@ ner , who hid the family of Dar@@ rell seven years while the British Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mug@@ gler &apos; where the s@@ mug@@ gler Arthur performers of the 18th century is presented that filled his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was only years later than his coff@@ in was buried . ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos; favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the masters seemed to be pretty good to keep debts and spend money on things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men dissolved their debt crises , by getting rich ancient women - I present it to me as a bunch of good @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advertise ore . &quot;
after the end of his engagement in the castle Rhodes is looking for another unique write @-@ up experience
he has got a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about E@@ sm@@ el@@ mä@@ ki behind it , the grounds of a san@@ at@@ orio from the early 20th century , which has been revi@@ ved by nature again .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : 300 years old Mari@@ en@@ cap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf eng@@ ul@@ fs
with the sleeve of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ en@@ cap@@ ella in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf launched the town of Bad Honnef on Friday its campaign for the introduction of a new roof brand ( Rundschau with Thursday ) .
even until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team to keep Nelson Ar@@ tz to keep the logo and the slogan .
in the end of August it is expected to be the highlight of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ ver@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
or ? &quot; ask the makers of the promotion since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we think this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; write them off at their yesterday &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; released Website &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and in order to make clear that some is better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we believe that we as a bathroom hon@@ or@@ fer citizens are very well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the action it is more than &quot; just &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says furthermore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said to form@@ ulate an all @-@ standing promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique selling point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , they stand in the competition with other municipalities .
a middle five @-@ digit amount will allow the city of Bad Honnef its new roof mark and the campaign .
Military reforms in Turkey - Cur@@ gans fears of the army
every year in early August , advises in Ankara of the Ober@@ ste Military Council ( Y@@ as ) on Pen@@ sion@@ ist and Be@@ akers in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine by the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
during the meetings , the Heads of State pres@@ ides as well as the five Vice ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er , as well as the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
they were the civilians in the Y@@ as population .
the government moves to the military in the military .
general secretary of Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office but the man@@ ders of the army , the air forces and the nav@@ y were dis@@ continued .
since the failed Cou@@ p , President Erdogan in 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who Erdogan as a dra@@ ers of the coup .
against 4@@ 86 people who were directly involved in the coup attempt , he has been negotiating in Ankara for this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in the day after the coup , Erdogan had opposed the overthrow of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God gift , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he gives him the opportunity to fully clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdogan really kill the army in hand ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ discomfort in the military headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the general rule , there are concerns over an increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the army , which in fact manifes@@ ts itself in the abolition of the head@@ scar@@ f ban on soldiers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the large @-@ cleaning in the army and the security guards goes on .
in the middle of July Erdogan is by Dec@@ ree another 7@@ 3@@ 95 state service providers , including 2@@ 303 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed that Erdogan was military .
the gener@@ als was formerly known as the actual masters of the country .
three times , they were calling for their role as a gu@@ ardian of the worldly state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdogan has adopted the power of the military step by step , not least due to the reform of the European Union .
former officers , Erdogan is targeted toward Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; a particular , not @-@ called officers who seek asylum from persecution in other countries asylum from persecution , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extremis@@ ts and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; in a few years .
meets this , such a development could not leave Nato .
in any case , there is no doubt in the alliance according to the pur@@ ges of the Turkish army .
the leadership structures and operational capabilities were weak@@ ened , &quot; says Nato diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tru@@ mp , cited by the media .
he looks to reduce the legal immigrants on 50,000 per year , more stringent regulation for obtaining visa for a perpet@@ ual work permits and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Re@@ public@@ ans and supported by the President .
the draft law should be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ payers and will do this by changing the way citizens from other countries Green Cards will be spent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chains of chains and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will come to candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , cited by the American media .
Ministry wishes to embark on track of racing
in recent months , more and more had been quar@@ rel@@ ed over the future of the race . now it &apos;s going to happen very quickly .
even before the end of the year it is scheduled to be built at the mar@@ o@@ des track on which the tourist rail runs .
in order to ensure the future of the race costs in the long term , according to the Department of Computer Science should start this year on the track .
&quot; by making a decision to order and re@@ fine the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ weg , the country has become important for tourism especially for tourism , &quot; stated Verkehrs@@ secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l am Friday in Er@@ furt .
the charge for the repair of the route he amoun@@ ted to about 2.5 million euros .
on this sum , the country ski@@ pped 75 per cent .
the contract , on whose basis the shuttle should also be ordered in the future of the country , is currently being voted , stated S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the Sou@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen train as the operators are already in agreement with the technical details already .
&quot; this is the roadmap that tra@@ ded the vehicles and the quality standards , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l .
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
so the race car will be ordered again on December 2017 .
the race bus shuttle is a popular travel connection between the railway stations of Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ weg .
in the course of the last months , in the course of a pilot company , it has been tested as if the stretch of sufficient many people is used to order them again in the future .
the track is also in parts very di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry
just as you thought it may not be any crazy , a new report comes across technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a big matter .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) published a report on the development of sex robo@@ tics in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ powering Professor for Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must begin to take their Ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye @-@ color of the robot , his form of ni@@ pple and type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; people make themselves funny , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them a lot more frequently , &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key in the publication of his new report .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ds have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions , which are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and choose everything from the eye @-@ colour of the robot to the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or colour of its f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is still disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person@@ ages &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which would be a step@@ ford @-@ woman progres@@ sively . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ds have developed to robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties which they appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ robots with pre @-@ programmed personalities as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; who gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy gold has a personality , which is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the site of True Cor@@ ion .
so may them what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you do not like , etc .
in the course of the day it also has its m@@ oods - quite like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; it can be tired , on conversation , or it can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the lower female properties , the proportions on rape , if you have a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( welcomes here : res@@ hap@@ ing ) Far@@ rah is troubled , un@@ troubled .
on his website True the companion of Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator then why can men then not have x@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; it is on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or simply just another sex toy .
their emergence and their increasing sophistic@@ ation point to something darker and deeper into our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with sub@@ ju@@ g@@ ation as an optional addition .
most men will of course have no sex robots , and while the FR@@ R re@@ alises their rising popularity , they remain temporarily on the br@@ ink of consumption culture .
but what perme@@ ates from the edge @-@ zones can be in relation to the spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not strange or abu@@ sive until they are the free market for this permission .
there is however a certain reason that these highly developed sex robots seem to appear during a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the White House who has pra@@ ved to have women sexually attacked .
the most hor@@ r@@ end@@ ous aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the slo@@ ped bodies and the extinct eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but in the moment this does not feel like a big jump .
the goal behind these sex robo@@ tics is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically feasible ( if also with port@@ no@@ star @-@ proportions ) .
their inheritance plans to make them feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , to the point when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot separate or just get away from their companion .
they have no mediation or background history , nothing that could interfere on independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total submission .
in other words : they are counter@@ f@@ eit slaves .
or to express it in the speech of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tru@@ mp@@ s great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney as the ep@@ it@@ ome of the healthy human mind
it has become a bin@@ sen@@ ess of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions that have pol@@ arized the U.S. elec@@ torate , even families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and Thanksgiving , there were newspapers in the US newspapers with advice on how to cho@@ king with the horror of Tru@@ mp &apos;s relatives .
we are all supposedly reck@@ oned to burst our filter bub@@ bles .
less noticed is the power of Tru@@ mp@@ s to bring together families together .
I chose this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ wing poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , this week has visited me in New York .
it reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tru@@ mp in the White House , anyone who knows them , including Republi@@ can kin@@ ship with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side .
around the dining table that &apos;s certainly a good thing , but it anno@@ ys me in a wider context that this will also involve considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the resulting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all towards the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the cru@@ el@@ ous possibility that most of us cannot rep@@ el us any more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is still a long @-@ distance lasting long @-@ term scenario , norm@@ alised in the Tru@@ mp Re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I find myself today by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s premi@@ er version of the ma@@ d@@ book - the dog on the car roof , which looked at 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked at ) - both compared to Tru@@ mp in fact a very mild criminal off@@ ences .
if Tru@@ mp is going , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can only be healthy to be able to qualify as im@@ measurable improvement .
when my C@@ ousine was in town , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ ally in Central Park , the biggest of the caravan of the New York Park@@ department , and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cris@@ p and the animals revol@@ ve to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and climate change brings it in strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city betrayed : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do the dream come true .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not quite clear about the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the Top@@ pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not part of it - but a big roundabout in the north of London .
however , central Park @-@ car@@ ou@@ sel is still a strange magic experience , as there are two two year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s , and all have a great time .
if I could have seen the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but luckily no one asked him afterwards .
on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my road it &apos;s the same plus the option to tip the rating with a 15 % grat@@ u@@ ity - this to buy something over the counter .
this leads not only to slow@@ ing down what a neutral exchange should be , it also gives pressure on the server to bring personality in a situation where no need is required .
the poor wife in the department store was exc@@ usable , while I felt tired of experience to submit my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us moved to hospital for breast cancer
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital stay for the second time .
last year he was transferred to the hospital for the treatment of Schn@@ itten , whom he suffered the prison authorities after a fall in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us condemned the appeal against a call for pro@@ secut@@ ors on a appeal against a call by the pro@@ secut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ en@@ kam@@ p in the early morning of the Valentine &apos;s Day in 2013 by placing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tor@@ ia .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a ni@@ gh@@ tly inv@@ ader that hid himself in the cabin .
the pro@@ secut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal against the six @-@ year @-@ old imprisonment of Pist@@ ori@@ us appeal to which they say it is too l@@ eni@@ ent .
the national pro@@ secutor authority said that they will raise the objection in the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection may be heard in this year .
Pist@@ ar@@ us works risk that his sentence will increase to 15 years if the pro@@ secut@@ ors are successful .

as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ cler@@ ders from f@@ uns and E@@ plet @-@ hofen were released into the holidays and into the further schools .
three of the students of the students go to school in the future , four to the Real@@ m school .
school@@ teachers Angel@@ ika sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the civil house bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ mat@@ en@@ hofen .
elected as a symbol of school dis@@ miss@@ al , the 29 students of the four classes , under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ des a young eag@@ les who grows in chicken , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to do this , the m@@ unter@@ e Sch@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the chicken &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it out of his chicken .
instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out .
but the hope to make a chicken out of him , sm@@ ote the eagle sm@@ ashing his wings on a high mountain and escap@@ ing his wings .
after that , the classes showed three and four in the studio of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken stock .
the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , which bore them to the bet .
the eag@@ les stand for the integration , said Sh@@ un@@ amm@@ ite Sit@@ te .
the young man is different from the other young animals ( cows ) , belong but to that .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she wanted every four @-@ legged friend that he felt at his new school .
there followed thanks to the colleagues , the former school leader Michael Müller , who always jumps at school dro@@ p@@ ses , and the par@@ ental representatives .
the chi@@ ken@@ era was now over , declared class teacher trained Sophia .
she dis@@ miss her students for two years of lessons , because it had been a really great time .
eventually she was able to rely on the four @-@ brack@@ ets .
at the end all students left a song of summer@@ time and vacation time .
and a great joy even broke out with the children .
for the new academic year already eight first @-@ tra@@ ilers are already registered .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested because of illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were incar@@ cer@@ ated for illegal camps in Greece , shared the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television .
in the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal refugees was arrested by the police in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on that same day , they were released , while an examination is currently running .
the State Department reported that the Bulg@@ arians later released .
the Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated control of the free Camp@@ s and place each one that is found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose to substantial cash stocks .
the controls will continue during the whole season .
the ministry said that the Court can impose a sentence .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
will the diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
at the diesel @-@ summit BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars .
you are supposed to improve the exhau@@ st behaviour of cars of the emissions classes for Euro 5 and some Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are exemp@@ t .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the software updates are optional .
&quot; the compulsory updates before are valid only for the vehicles , the che@@ ers software , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
their retro@@ fit has arranged the Federal Office of the Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a growing implementation in the coming months , but no exact date is mentioned .
Daimler has announced to write any person concerned .
if any inspection is required , this will be done in their frame .
how long should the conver@@ ters go on in total ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
the company is dependent on the commitment of the manufacturers , as well as by political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after we have seen , voluntary companies do not act on the subject of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
re@@ armament itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be there to get an appointment .
what do motor@@ ists do , who do not drive a car of BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE goes for the wait .
most foreign manufacturers would have moved , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
well , does a massive price fall of Euro @-@ 4 @-@ cars ?
the ACE has been feared .
but even in the regions , where driving messages can thre@@ aten .
so far in rural areas there is no value loss for older diesel .
the ACE goes , with a sale still to be seen .
ll Cool J gets Kennedy Center @-@ Award
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glam@@ orous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony among President Tru@@ mp promised to be politically .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets first R@@ apper one of the cov@@ eted awards from the prestigious Kennedy Center .
like the Kul@@ tu@@ re@@ direction , announced on Thursday , this year also singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Ri@@ chy ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV @-@ producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) for the honoured .
the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp will organize a reception and join with his wife Mel@@ ania at the rental .
the announced TV series with progressive TV shows are already announced to rel@@ inqu@@ ish the participation in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Presidency has decided to neglect the arts and human rights - even the means to depri@@ ve them - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that they will use Tru@@ mp to make their view clear .
the Kennedy @-@ Center after former president John F. Kennedy @-@ Center is the largest cultural retreat in the U.S. capital .
among the earlier pre@@ fers are Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Franklin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks , and St@@ ing .
we make the city li@@ vable
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister goes next year in R@@ ente .
the place is already written - appropriate applicants are scarce .
since 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work still makes him great fun as he was performing in the press interview .
he reports on varied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for His followers .
at the same time , it mir@@ ac@@ ulous that no application can feed the requirements specification .
the city is currently looking for an architect or a civil engineer for the next time .
so - taking into account the regular notice period - enough time for development .
because Has@@ lach is on behalf of the administrative community as under@@ e construc@@ tors , the applicant needs to prec@@ ede appropriate conclusions .
because this function wants to keep the city definitely .
if they can no longer fill it , the citizens would have to drive to Offen@@ burg before Offen@@ burg .
but the proximity between the city and itself is important , says W@@ acker that tells of a good working atmosphere , as well as a good mood between authority and citizens .
over 30 years in office some important projects have accumulated while anticip@@ ating pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city li@@ vable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building and its staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda : re@@ designing the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ als and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ park@@ platz .
the Kin@@ zig@@ bridge between B@@ oll@@ en@@ bach and Stein@@ ach will be renewed , even the stadium extension is still subject .
the latter is beating just about 1.5 million Euros to be@@ ech , &quot; if we really do it , &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker .
&quot; all in all wait great tasks for my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
age @-@ old is of great room for a Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own construction and gar@@ dener , much is flexible to react .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the gre@@ ens systems will often be praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old city as ensemble stands under monument protection , it is important to have an eye for what it fits , &quot; when re@@ builds are granted , empha@@ sizes the ex@@ cre@@ ting Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
in any case , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has a high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a trademark , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs through my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on many years of care and co @-@ ordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ maier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing so for ten years now , Manfred Schön@@ er ( frozen ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , that his successor remains long , W@@ acker says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wanted to identify and remain with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working environment , but also for the further design of the city .
who would like to receive Roland W@@ acker , should deliver a diploma degree from the City of Has@@ lach as a diploma @-@ engineer or Bachelor based architectural design and have good knowledge in the areas of building and building design .
the municipal office is under@@ mined high and civil engineering , construction planning , ridge management , municipal property , urban facility and municipal gardens , as well as sub @-@ building law , including memorial protection .
bicycle on the direc@@ tional : southern track locked
according to the police , the in@@ famous perpetr@@ ator had the blue bike from the railway track record in the area of the lead road ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were so heavily damaged that the approaching freight @-@ train had to be hal@@ ted .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male t@@ ants and look for the night@@ time hours after them .
near the scene , we had been observed by witnesses a ros@@ ary Rol@@ ler@@ - and a bike @-@ driver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ d stre@@ ich , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch to the A@@ PA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the or the offen@@ ders would have brought himself in great danger and are also jeop@@ ardi@@ zing the train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the complex as well as the delay and the cost of rail transport , P@@ ön@@ d@@ ys of rail customers could come to the perpetrators .
overall , be determined by a &quot; significant &quot; sum , the speaker said .
the damages were rec@@ eded on Friday morning , traffic traffic on the South track can be led without disability .
nearly 10 person@@ enz@@ ings were planned Friday afternoon , two of them consider the correspondence .
goods fell not out , but they had a delay .
according to the BB @-@ speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged around 200 meters of over@@ pipes .
the ins@@ ulators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to relie@@ ve IB@@ D ( inflammation @-@ sickness )
red meat and chocolate can end for your digestive system like a nightmare .
but a new study maintains exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could relie@@ ve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
the incur@@ able condition in the U.S. affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom 300@@ ,000 , causing ga@@ stri@@ fe and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those affected are usually advised to relie@@ ve meat and milk products , researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins cause to develop immune @-@ cells that promote a tolerant intestinal tract .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immun@@ o @-@ cells in the intest@@ ine pat@@ rol to make sure that detrimental micro@@ bes that hide in food does not enter into the body .
cells , which are capable of trig@@ gering inflammation , are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the sensitive tissue .
when the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it may result in a inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
in experiments was found that a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell is found on mice that carry a particular bacter@@ ium in their ent@@ ates .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the gem@@ stones of proteins to dis@@ solve the appearance of cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial art - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice in their food the more they had of this immune @-@ cell . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ rich nutrition is tolerant , if the same system is inf@@ ring@@ ed with people .
the Post@@ doc@@ torate in Dr. Luisa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance , when she found out that a group of studies had such cells , but another group of the same tribe that had not been accommodated .
they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi , who normally live in the stomach @-@ intestinal tract .
the mice of the mice have been DNA sequences and six bacterial species were found , which were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing on mice .
mice were raised in an ster@@ il@@ ful environment so that they l@@ acked a intestinal micro@@ bial and not developed these types of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune system .
to understand how the bacteria gained on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i have grown in a liquid and then resulted in small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on im@@ mature immune cells , which were isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed into the tolerant cells .
as the active component of the fluid has been cleans@@ ed , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ metabol@@ ites which is known as the In@@ dol @-@ 3 l@@ actic acid .
if the researchers have doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of mice , the number of such cells grew by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ uses were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same tolerant cells like mice , and that most of us have to protect us through our gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ Side products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in people such as mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ inflammatory bo@@ dying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote , since these cells are inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ values can lead to a expansion of these populations . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed to a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
at Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , &quot; believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut in S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia .
the 40 Million Po@@ und Sig@@ ned of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last Pre @-@ season Game , before the UEF@@ A @-@ super Cup beginning on Tuesday , and impressive in Hal@@ ter &apos;s role as people mar@@ ched as Paul Po@@ g@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira after Bel@@ i@@ eben .
but MA@@ TIC was excluded from the prepar@@ atory @-@ Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , that he had to improve before the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides M@@ atic also Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u joined the Avi@@ va Stadium , as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had three additional responsibilities , but he insisted that the club was already given a &quot; fantastic job &quot; three of its four priority accounting .
&quot; three of us to get , for this I thank the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happier if you get four out of four , but they have given great efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner into the sky
the US airplane maker Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the US state Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US @-@ state Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers on the USA , which are several thousand kilometres .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar there was the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers .
the whole was a stamina test for new engines .
Boeing has already previously made such advertising .
so , the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing @-@ logo was painted over the sky .
new pl@@ aster for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
as the wind still turns : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD boss , S &amp; D Vice @-@ President always looked after elections with a certain point of view in Berlin .
merely no disturbing fires from the party central , merely don &apos;t have a ju@@ go from the Bund - so lau@@ d the most important desire of the election comb@@ at@@ ant .
since Martin Schulz , the party has changed , has changed tremend@@ ously .
since then the employees of the Willy Brandt @-@ House has since been observ@@ ant of the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals .
what Mr Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach .
there were depression .
and one after another .
the C@@ CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and Green Party in Lower Saxony after the end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony .
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ Green can simply not reign , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start@@ led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fra@@ ction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the Sunday &apos;s election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its A @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ PD .
the Green Federal Minister for Michael Kellner has called on the inten@@ tional Nieder@@ säch@@ sische green @-@ members El@@ ke T@@ ests to return its mandate .
the re@@ mitt@@ ance to the CD@@ U means a clear violation of the voting .
El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets must immediately return its mandate , &quot; said the Bundes@@ wehr and election campaign to the Gre@@ ens Network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; si@@ ties an SPD @-@ Elec@@ tor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as on Friday morning the new Hi@@ ke message reached the party key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD @-@ Minister of Nieder@@ sachsen , stands after the over@@ head of the Green Party El@@ ke T@@ ests to the CD@@ U without its own government majority .
it is the provisional highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what next comes next .
the misery begins with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med down the comrades of the time .
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphal@@ ia , everything will be different .
this became then also - and everything was clearly worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to ruin , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite Haute the party .
lab@@ orious the comrades in the weeks after that come back .
then , when they had just turned new courage , the G @-@ 20 top came from Hamburg .
and with it came the next step @-@ up .
Mayor O@@ la@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD member , lost his nim@@ bus at that weekend because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned .
and because he then did pretty much wrong in the crisis of crisis communication , what you can do wrong .
since then Schol@@ z fights for his political survival .
so now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW exhau@@ st gas and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Nieder@@ säch@@ sische Prime Minister has already been in criticism for a long time .
mi@@ ese re@@ frac@@ tures came along .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely , Wei@@ l tried to get stronger in the past few weeks .
the aim of the former mayor of Hannover , to develop his power in Berlin , did not remain hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz .
they let him grant him as they promised themselves by Wei@@ l , a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could arise .
in doing so , Wei@@ l against the bi@@ parti@@ ality of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens are basically no fault .
and Schulz did not at all at all .
sometimes , the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks shut down .
their anger directed itself to the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the ab@@ ber@@ ant parliament@@ arians .
&quot; it is unbe@@ arable and democratic fashion as Ms T@@ jack@@ ets their own career entran@@ ts on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , chief of the party @-@ left in the SPD parliamentary survey , the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) .
MS T@@ jack@@ ets is not elected by her person as direct candidate , but rather on the country list of the Lower Saxony in parliament , so the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on MP continued .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , leader of the SPD parliamentary group , compl@@ ained a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; the vot@@ er @-@ cast four years ago was clear : people have made Stephen Wei@@ l to the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann who runs the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on SPD as a pioneer in the Bundest@@ ags @-@ election to the R@@ ND .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is adul@@ ter@@ ated the personal career rules of a future CD@@ U MEPs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked to clarify the background .
I want to know if there have been more or there has been further commitments made by the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
Förder@@ verein for Ort@@ k@@ ern III
those who want to get in the years will soon get support from the country .
informed by Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representative St@@ eg &apos;s development on Wednesday in delicate .
at the beginning of the information seminar , Sch@@ ind@@ ler had even a look at the previously mentioned event .
since 1991 there were in received san@@ them@@ atic areas .
back then , in the refurb@@ ishment region I from 1991 to 2004 , the State of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding rates .
in the refurb@@ ishment region II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was still at least 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler the existing re@@ ments are a &quot; success project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to foster the internal development and not only tap into new construction areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4 , I will receive the information from the governing council in Karlsruhe that there will be a refurb@@ ishment area III .
the funding rates are 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which Che@@ ms 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the church received .
so how is a refurb@@ ishment ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to investigate the Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role , whether in the planned area will be in general interest , to san@@ e .
if necessary the d@@ et@@ s@@ limits could then also be postponed .
the pon@@ to@@ on appeared on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
cellar presented the contents of the federal state @-@ program &quot; Social city , &quot; in whose framework the renov@@ ations would be carried out .
core of the program are the revit@@ alisation of Inn@@ es , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , that is , per plot , performed .
the re@@ organisation would finally be established as a stat@@ ute .
the deadline for funding exp@@ ires since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2017 .
however until September this year the inventory would only be carried out as a questionnaire to fill out the questionnaire .
in November or December , the pro@@ vocation is to take place as soon as possible , so that we can begin with the renov@@ ations in the coming year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that every Comm@@ une must carry out the bes@@ po@@ tion investigations .
it is about evaluating the urban eb@@ ony dis@@ ables and decide when it is used and to which extent .
there will then also be a re@@ organisation of the property for the respective site .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come once again and get a picture of the situation , she promised her .
Got@@ zel stressed , an essential success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore there will be questionn@@ aires who will be sent to citizens in the next weeks and will be filled out by the end of the summer holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building and property depos@@ itors , &quot; in which there is among other things devoted to the state of construction and the refurb@@ ishment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data can be made on size , division and inhabitants of a living room . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oper@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to fill in when building business areas are operated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is to be noted that Got@@ zel pointed out that an executed questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding .
moreover , new measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler stressed that the distribution of funding for the &quot; Wind@@ dog principle &quot; - who first comes , promp@@ ts first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there can be no support for later &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end some photographs of the project &quot; Ort@@ k@@ ern II &quot; were shown to make the presence of a refurb@@ ishment &quot; tasty . &quot;
British invent@@ ors set itself a micro@@ chi@@ chip to come up with a towel in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a microphone , so that he may open his door , enter his office and even start his car .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ pl@@ ated the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and foref@@ inger and now offers service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by the company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has organized himself with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ a@@ es@@ theses in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , conven@@ ed to make sure that the implant procedures are carried out according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chi@@ pped and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr North@@ - also wants to change the castles in houses and cars , that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per castle .
the married father of one has now installed both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the Advertising of the White House costs tax@@ payers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Law@@ n for an event that dates the American production last month , costs tax@@ payers according to the military &apos;s data that have been left to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky v@@ H @-@ 3D , known as marine One when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Executive officials of the White House made a round@@ trip out of all 50 states .
the helicopter turned into Connecticut was exhibited in addition to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ fighter car from Wisconsin and a for@@ kli@@ fts from Mississippi .
the White House of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in an frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , hardly 36 hours before the helicopter landing at the South Law@@ n , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to become aware of it because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of H@@ MX @-@ 1 at the eve of the event of his superi@@ ors , deputy prime minister of aviation .
the news displayed that the helicopter arrived on July 17 at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South Law@@ n for the event at 15@@ pm , and so long stayed until the tur@@ f between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening was cleared .
the note adds that if your departure from the White House would be delayed , due to the restriction of the utility you would need a second crew for the flight back .
the original flight race was during the event by helicopter , while the security personnel remained the unit during the time on the plane .
the recordings provided by the TI@@ ME was not clear whether a second flight was ultimately necessary .
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal property rights for political purposes .
dat@@ as@@ ets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked whether or not the event could viol@@ ate the destination .
&quot; one question that we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the Commander .
&quot; sound as if you are locked , &quot; said the Deputy Commander .
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated as the official event by the White House and were not covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an impetus for the reform of the health sector reform in the Senate , and he pro@@ ached the effort to allevi@@ ate the government &apos;s regulations .
the use of the plane which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , from politically favourable purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but your use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
in February , Tru@@ mp conducted an investigation as the Presidential plane in front of the background of his first Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , cab services , and his Twitter account is full of announcements that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessors .
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 occup@@ ations often perform training flights in the area around Washington and in South Law@@ n , to set the U.S. President in the White House with precise centimeters .
when Tru@@ mp was at the G@@ 20 top in Germany in early July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led to the White House 58 practice land@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was counted on the training needs of the flight meeting for the month , said an official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Heli@@ kop@@ ter units flew in addition to 11 hours on that day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support commis@@ sions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ payers were the burden for none of the other re@@ qu@@ ites that were presented at the event .
he said a spokes@@ man by Si@@ kor@@ sky , the company was not involved to put helicop@@ ters to the South Law@@ n .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have a budget designation for the presidential election , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D @-@ Er@@ ate@@ set is available for the v@@ H @-@ 3D however 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
record of the unit shows the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Cor@@ ps Air Facility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of running the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tax@@ payers &apos; costs on the basis of estimates for the refund can be highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs , which are included in the annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND survey conducted in 2015 , the turnover rate for DO@@ D does not include the costs of personnel , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract completion .
at that time the former press secretary of the White House , Sean Sp@@ icer , the use of helicop@@ ters to the event .
&quot; the idea is to present this week things that are made in America , &quot; said Sp@@ read .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know Si@@ kor@@ sky and the federal state Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked tirel@@ essly .
it is of course appropriate that it should be emphasized . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp was inter@@ acting with the helicopter as he entered his tour across the South Law@@ n for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ fighter .
in the White House , Tru@@ mp spoke at the representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and jo@@ king with the media about its own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

how America can harm the O@@ MV
really happy , Donald Tru@@ mp did not work when he placed his signature under the law on intensi@@ fication of sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his ha@@ ste , the law en@@ acted , &quot; did the Congress packed a few &quot; un@@ constitutional regulations . &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ aming the US off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft is to pun@@ ish European companies who help the Russians to build pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors have been worried by the domestic ou@@ re@@ MV since then , together with other European companies , the construction of the Russian east@@ ward spiral lines 2 is co @-@ financed .
the dro@@ ught is tremendous .
nevertheless , be it too early for an assessment of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil group .
in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp would have to resur@@ rec@@ t the sanctions yet by an executive order to live .
twelve weapons are available to him for the election .

roll ben@@ ding : the city provides 46 cook@@ ers
the city organized the cas@@ ita @-@ lunch table once more .
with strong contact persons for the children and one assignment to the team .
in the city &apos;s day@@ care centres the clock is fli@@ pped .
on 1st September the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supplies in the city &apos;s day@@ care centres ( kit@@ as ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy leader in the field of youth aid , this is good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we continue to be cooked except house : a Cater@@ er takes over this task and delivers fresh cool@@ ed .
the city operates in the cre@@ ek area 46 kinder@@ gartens , in 44 get the children at lun@@ ch@@ time a warm meal .
last year , 2@@ 800 children at the tables , and the demand grew steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by now we eat not only children who are to be supervised by 45 Wo@@ ch@@ - , in the K@@ ita for mid@@ day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies to the 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children remain until 14 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time forces have from 1 September kitchen service : you war@@ med up the s@@ late food , supplement it to salad , raw food and fruit , imports the meal individually , give the food from , clean and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are firmly associated with a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two @-@ groups as well as seven @-@ sized institutions - decides over the timetable .
&quot; the kitchen staff are now part of the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much stronger and it is easier for the ti@@ ghter to implement more educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because that is why it is about healthy food and cooking .
&quot; the children should help to prepare the food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen force is to be useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known power in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , not always changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleansing of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - up to now also the task of the kitchen forces - is going to be done by special cleaning personnel .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also has the charm that it has turned out in the cost between self @-@ control and foreign exchange for the city as the economical choice , it is from the press office .
and this , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours of approximately 750 people in education are not so strong in weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Nicholas Hay@@ ro@@ some , acting director of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women are can@@ ast@@ ered by the council elections in the provinces . three women are candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and over 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement .
elections can only be truly representative and credible , when women participate fully and involve in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5 instead .
the Taliban have published threats against a election process , which coinci@@ des with the transition of international combat operations to an advisory role .
this year the elections for the first time will be peacefully set aside from a democratically elected government for the next time .
Hay@@ ro@@ some said , A strong role for women will increase the democratic success of Afghanistan .

GM@@ B concerns about investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to look at the managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it @-@ manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie for long @-@ term commitment to production in their plant in Glasgow .
GM@@ B Scotland said the company was silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which besides other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ I Tea bis@@ cuits .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested over 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experienced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Fili@@ man@@ ites of the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GM@@ B Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s to express &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerns to express their financing for modernization of production lines will not be promoted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; GM@@ B senior managers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GM@@ B Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we are unable to gain clarity about the needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members deeply concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generations of families have worked here and the labor force strong focus on the local community and the Grand area of Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high levels of unemployment and social de@@ priv@@ ation .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ xit , the rising living cost and the chronic process of production , the eastern end of Glasgow , urgently needed a thri@@ ving production of production at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
speaking of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the Fili@@ in@@ ite in T@@ oll@@ cross received a letter from GM@@ B Scotland and the company will respond directly to it as we appreciate the continuous engagement with employees and trade union representatives .
we had a regular meeting with employees and GM@@ B representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we work like all companies active in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic environment , our business constantly review - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to stay competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds , especially in production lines and operative improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognise the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site whol@@ eh@@ ear@@ tedly . should our operating practices change at the location , employees and their trade union officials will be the first to learn this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warned of three years before N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the site of La League may not regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain won &apos;t leave N@@ ey@@ mar in its persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , after having issued an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to dis@@ solve its open @-@ cast clause , but have warned that Barcelona three years ago before the world empire ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer because the Lig@@ ue 1 @-@ Club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark , whereby Paul Po@@ g@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds .
after the end , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive players in the world and for the highest paid professional athlete of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of over 500@@ ,000 GB@@ P per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious over the way as N@@ ey@@ mar has forced its way to the outside , although there is always a source in the proximity of Catal@@ ans , that the club always has its best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but the football world was warned against this prospect three years ago by the PS@@ G President ?
as Manchester City 2014 interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any association , who wanted to sign one of the best players from PS@@ G .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried , because when they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will contact them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players at their sign , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , whereby the Spanish club gave the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G @-@ center@@ field Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G made clear that it would not allow the International from Italy to leave in any circumstances , and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by lost one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen @-@ report un@@ loaded Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen @-@ Report on the de@@ fle@@ t@@ lement of Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse of the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen is ongoing for discussions .
Christian Weis@@ ants , spokes@@ man of the reform Movement , &quot; stated after publication of the German press agency , he expects from the former Rain@@ bow Bishop and today &apos;s Car@@ dinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology .
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church , when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false evaluation of processes .
the Vatican paper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; is critici@@ zed that in the coverage of violence in the domains are measured with &quot; two dimensions . &quot;
regarding the attacks in Regensburg we have doubts that this would have to be &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful actions , &quot; but the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; said the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historians and a member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit to call the Catholic Church as a source of evil is already part of the day @-@ day experience and preparing public opinion that is for normal to keep &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis meant in an interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; one would like to go to the church and that is a bo@@ ating gro@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , they pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beats a very normal pedago@@ gical state &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about children , as I was one was finished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are making it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on the de@@ co@@ ders , pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
completely wrong , writes author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who auth@@ ored with R@@ atz@@ inger the reminder , &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he adds up the results of the final report .
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , issued by the B@@ ish@@ um Regensburg with the educ@@ ative lawyer Ulrich Weber presented ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen were killed between 1945 and the early 1990s , &quot; with high pl@@ ings &quot; victims of attacks , 67 dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen sexually ab@@ used .
the final report says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , which was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , he suggests that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. used in many cases forms of physical and psych@@ ic violence .
especially with high Emo@@ tional action the punishment for students could also fall heavily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , contrary to numerous other def@@ endants , this is the fact that many victims were the general humanity of R. , and therefore in many cases , despite violence they even combine positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , E@@ ze@@ emann , why the final report on the disp@@ ens@@ ity sc@@ andal made by the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was relie@@ ved of his opinion .
Mr E@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; sei@@ zur@@ es of violence of violence , are bef@@ ieder@@ ted with the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen , &quot; gives a conflic@@ ting picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
for one , many students hei@@ gh@@ ten his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ cian and perfec@@ tionist who , who became hand@@ some , if a domain was not related to a top performance .
how do you evaluate this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : when you make the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger thinks about it at all in it .
he is dedicated to eight sites for just eight pages and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of mutual or co @-@ knowledge in the terrible cases sexual abuse .
also the violence at the front @-@ school occurred outside of its activity .
you may pre @-@ throw it , too late , or having taken first evidence not seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ appearance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the high school , on which he worked , was felt by practically all the in@@ quired as - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus also the wide majority of his pupils Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents him quite an excellent record , &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teachers who held the guys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cho@@ col@@ ates and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ained about his perfec@@ tionist and his high degree of emotion@@ ality , which also already took to erup@@ tion .
that he did not only sk@@ ate with chairs and put the key@@ chain on the ground , but also ear@@ rings divided and too nau@@ ghty guys who moved to the hair or ears , he himself already gave birth to years ago , deeply de@@ pl@@ ored and exc@@ used for them too .
to his honor to salvation , however , has to be said that such educ@@ ating methods were in the demand time , the 1960s and 1970s , where parents like teachers .
do you still know such breeding techniques ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I have also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asium .
compared to what it is actually involved in this report , namely the force@@ ful sexual abuse and the us@@ uses at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , the admittedly are dre@@ dging .
you wonder if it &apos;s not related to his famili@@ arity and role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just rus@@ hed to him .
in the Bav@@ arian pop@@ e , many , who have never understood him , are still busi@@ ly .
but the truth is : the report relie@@ ves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in connection with the report we report a lot about the issue of abuse at the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen ( Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is also put in the final report any complic@@ ation or co @-@ knowledge with regard to sexual abuse ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
no single of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to be acquainted with the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were dedicated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to speak with my father or my mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a sufferers in the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the true issue in educ@@ ating sexual abuse has been and is that most of the victims are not silent .
if they don &apos;t even have to famili@@ arize themselves with parents and si@@ blings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral leader , who would have been a career of perpetrators .
how do you rate the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen @-@ student R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of dis@@ bre@@ ws ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a be@@ ati@@ ful student formats it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see ... no case , in which he had had expected ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) timely findings and could have stopped the respective offen@@ ders .
I consider it ... also for really absurd to accept that coming out to him ... Bu@@ ben pus@@ hy or clear or also rather opened , as opposed to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s@@ managers , senior teachers , etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ thin@@ kable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in advance of the purposes concerned with the purposes and / or their environment , he could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as regards sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free from any fellow convic@@ tions .
he cannot be accused of him , nor prevented him or to have brought him to the ad .
therefore , there is no reason to associate its good name with these res@@ isting crimes , as it was happening in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was read by the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen ( Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thrown off in the report . &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed up to a giant mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere , in the midst of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is precisely such a abuse of the report .
namely , clean separate : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the gymn@@ asium of the dom@@ ic@@ at@@ zen , between sexual abuse and violence as well as saying , we say once , other alleg@@ ations .
it also deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a choir leader in the cathedral @-@ season .
the whole terrible test of pedago@@ gy , the cases , in which l@@ ad of sa@@ di@@ st teachers were literally sent and mal@@ igned , and among them ent@@ win@@ ed , together , together , together , together , have to prevail in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to be ruled out .
but with whom had Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger not to do anything , because he got the boys to face only when they were already high school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , like most witnesses , stress the topic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vor@@ schule &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly things . &quot;
what was different from the pre @-@ record level for school ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was already a discipline , but there is no sa@@ di@@ st violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims were the general humanity of R. , and therefore in many cases , despite violence they even combine positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the most still the accus@@ ation to have a look .
but despite all efforts , the report was able to define just two periods in which the states were reported on the pres@@ ch@@ ool .
the first time 1970 / 71 when he began to establish itself and from the operations at a school where he was not and responsible ( so the witness ) wanted nothing to hear , and then again in 1993 .
only Georg R@@ atz@@ inger before the states consistently the ears ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 , he wrote a letter to the Director of the N@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s power station , which the report was even reproduced .
in this he points out that he will continue to be practiced in the pre @-@ school . &quot;
already in the light of the risk of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action .
this was of course at a time when legal clarity was , as the exam@@ iner in Bavaria had already been banned .
before that it occurred in a legal gray area , as each one of us knows well .
it was also difficult for him to estimate where the persons affected may be exaggerated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the permitted border had been exceeded .
but one can also not say he had always looked .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the exam@@ iner in schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria too .
Für@@ stin Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis found it to be unfair to apply today &apos;s educational criteria for the then time .
how do you see that ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; Sn@@ are of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; i.e. the danger of judging by the current moral things .
the princess has already right .
but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was vile at all times and has not been broken for what has been broken down at the pres@@ ch@@ ool of ad@@ versity and violence at an inno@@ cent child axis , that is far beyond that time ago .
that is all very aw@@ ful and I am glad it is finally working .
but at the same time , I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , for all this had nothing to do with him .
its means to discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , so ear@@ chers and pull on the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then banned , it has also kept strictly in mind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of his Rain@@ ap@@ artist Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of Pope John &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject re@@ fine also to the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book we are talking about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , told from his perspective , as played the domains , only a secondary role .
nevertheless , I did not conce@@ de that he led a stric@@ ter regim@@ ent there .
but even that must be said : without this perfec@@ tionist , without demanding un@@ condition@@ ally discipline , it would probably barely possible to form an institution of world @-@ related , true cultural message of Europe and his musical tradition that went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with cookies and Bon@@ go alone , you make out of un@@ ru@@ sty boys now not even big singers and in front of every success , regardless of what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of person have you experienced for George R@@ atz@@ inger for the conversations with her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really quite well and again experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , rock @-@ hearted , deep gul@@ li@@ ble and sav@@ our@@ able people , from which you can &apos;t imagine that he could only do something about fly .
I regularly receive , as many former Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen are still alive , 23 years after his embar@@ king , regularly contact him , read him , he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family .
those who have not for@@ given him today , that he once was strictly speaking to them , are clearly in the minority .
most dom@@ ic@@ ts are grateful to him today that he enriched her life and brought them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , father@@ ly teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but yet a ad@@ orable respect , to which they still look up today and which they even worship them .
and please , once again clear : all that you pro@@ ps him are gu@@ ardi@@ ans that were then on the order of the day .
we can be glad that we have overcome this time long .
but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al s@@ cap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intention behind this , only too obvious .
for the report that has just been published , relie@@ ved him .
now the dec@@ ency is , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great earnings and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany no one would know the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen ( the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen ) , finally in peace .
