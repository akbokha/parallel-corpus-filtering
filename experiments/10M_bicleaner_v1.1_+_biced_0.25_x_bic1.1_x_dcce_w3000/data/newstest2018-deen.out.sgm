<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards, which change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">A Irish institution where young people are going to meet.</seg>
<seg id="3">A greeting chapel, where now for the S-Bahn Tunnel are buried.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners cultivate the past cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories to come.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying when landing cards are not up to date.</seg>
<seg id="7">This knows everyone who had to take an upright because the car Navi instead of a bypass street showed a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historic maps of the digital Bayern Atlas, an offer of the Geo-Portal in the Bavarian State, are anything but up to date - just so very enlightening.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury in Munich since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern Atlas is a splatency work that is not immediately visible as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large coverage map for cities and communities we receive detailed maps, so-called priesdatasheets.</seg>
<seg id="13">These arose according to the Bavarian surveyed administration between 1810 and 1864, and escaped from the first deduction of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army secretary occupied Bavaria since the spring 1800 during the Second Koalitioneges with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon was looking at an overview of the occupied country and was commissioned by topographic reception - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if French troops were finally moved with the peace of Lunéville, February 9, 1801: they were today's neighbours who created the idea of a region-wide Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Kurfürst Max IV." "" "was further forward the project, founded the" "" "topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bayerische Vermessisation" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urpositional blatt for Munich dates back to 1856, and is like all the others on the site of the Bayerischer Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison earlier / today is the example of the provincial capital most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is subsendling that appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was 21 years after creation of the map, thus 1877, as Munich part of the district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling lies in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendman concentrate on today's Plinganserstraße which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, you see nothing but fields - at first glance: with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten flotings from so-called "urine" from which the base tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots do not occupy there any farmers anymore - but small gardeners of the complex "land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green space is situated north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 roplace of the October Revolution, was in the 19th century indeed a meadow - and no concrete form.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map provides an insight into the history of the psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Urpositional blatt, in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen is not only reading the street name "on Gaststag" or from the ascent "On the air - but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt. "</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstrasse there are once people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">There was 1858 / 59 the Münchner-Irrenanstalt "on the Auer Lünen.</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - the psychiatrist, who in connection with the death of King Ludwig's II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended for example the purchase of the so-called Irish." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">He has forbidden the personnel forbidden to apply violence against inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, Director of the Haidhausen museum, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients first was first enough, later on 500 places were expanded.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometime we have reached this capacity no more - the reason for the construction of the circular penitentiary in hair in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-East, one of the biggest psychiatrists in Germany since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">The real estate of the former Auer Anstalt are now meeting young people at Munich's Salesanum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth-home with training facility.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the soccer field of the TSV in East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, one taught the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" - in an architectural reference to the country of origin of the Ird district, which had been destroyed during World War II during bombans.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was" "" "head office" "" "in 1856 as the" "" "Head Office" "" "had called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies, in December 1944, got a lot of holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained to this day - Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English institute, small business buildings and a pit chapel from the Middle Ages stood at the Marienhof where these days are the pretenement and place on 5 April 2017 the spade for the second S-Bahn.</seg>
<seg id="49">The old Munich-map enables to compare the old Munich-map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights, published before the Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the promotion of coloured is issued a warning for color-colored people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policy and racist attacks by the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Council for the federal state Missouri, who is to come into force up to 28 August 2017, invites special attention to visitors and Missovereign, as a number of fragmented, rinsing pre-based projections can occur in the whole state and can be noticed here," it is in the Group's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder to gain discrimination, as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state that are disproportionate to minorities, led the group to recover the travel warning, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have injury to citizens' rights that people happen.</seg>
<seg id="55">They will be arrested because of their skin colour, they are put together or killed, "said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear afflictions in such a frequency we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited as racist condemning against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no gasoline any longer during the journey and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent article by Missouri in Missouri, to be shown that black motorists in the state 75 percent are more common than whistles.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and about their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be willing to bring both Caution or relatives that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri drew up 100 hate crimes in 2015, following the latest figures from the Spanish criminal investigation programme of the FBI, which shifted the state into relation to the number of such violations in the 16th position of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">Travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to shorten a company because of living or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties (ACLU) had issued warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the countries of immigration law adopted that local law enforcement authorities are committed to concede people due to immigration violations, which will contribute to provocative views of the ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel openings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent times, stakeholders have deployed the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">Weights project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fishing village of Weidefence-Project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-Bundestags M.White and Kordula Kovac took a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the right-digging of the family Schwendemann met representatives of the Fishell CDU local network together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two lobbying.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann granted insights into his farm, in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 cows, and there are also many young animals and houses in five apartments of the Feriengaeste.</seg>
<seg id="72">The "Black-milk" is for him the alternative market-proof for the milk of its cows, so Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaeste comes exclusively onales.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "as it is also BLHV-president of Fisherbach, he described the Weiler project as" "" "spontaneous" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can manage on such steep areas not in a profitable way.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green-area care for a lot of work, much needed to be edited with the engine sense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here to fight with the conditions and with the topography," Schwendemann stressed.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the elterous operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilisers, even though he does not lead bio-business.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognised the meaning of the Weiler Project and is happy with the leader of the leader." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, the farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">"" "" "" "we hope that the reforestation of surfaces nor a whole while could be moved." ""</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have, the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their operation," stressed the Mayor.</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often referred to in criticism due to funding</seg>
<seg id="84">Over the Weights promotion were fenced in 2013 for a total of 25 plots of eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">This open surface is about 40 hectares, which are not allowed to be hosted by at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 euros was promoted to half by leader, a quarter carried out the municipality of Fisherbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, farmers love 12 610 euros, which they had to get in 16.2 kilometers pasture.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," declared Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and farmers it doesn't."</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter Weiss we stand:" "" "here the best food is produced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape of Agriculture (LPR) Baden-Württemberg is possible for the government to promote pastures.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the preservation of the Schwarzwald.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of one of the LPR recorded conveyor belts.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the occlanding area may not be inconclusive (Hangaversion over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the Fisherbacher Weights project 2018, the application of eight participants is running with 24 plots, which would like to build nearly 16 kilometers of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The accounting surface is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime transfer is it when they begin to attacking statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans estimate this as well as any other - therefore the careful fall of Saddam Hussein at the Firm place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic fee with Jim Acosta from CNN about the proposals of the President to the drastic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To be fair, Miller did not hold the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-Imitators had it paralysed if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he attacked its importance, and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus, 17 years after the completion of the monumental homage, was added to his basis.</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "when Miller Acosta complained:" "" "I don't want to enter a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is principally correct, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance to the distorted words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your exhausted, your poor, / your depressing crowds, who yearn to breathe free, / the elaring waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "eliling waste" was better seen on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not involved in literary critic - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in the Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict: it is in fact a conflict with the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus and her friends who put themselves in place their words for their death on the base - did very good that they have been doing a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the links between French and American republicanism, presenting the feminine embodiment of freedom in an unused classical exposition.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives himself a very different name: mother of exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist Coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And exactly as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John of the Baptist, argued for the coming of Trump, argued for the Statue of Liberty, rather an early neo-conservative, which bring the American flame into the re-reated world: "Lady Liberty is proceeding.</seg>
<seg id="119">She is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not meant to illuminate the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here found on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is entirely at all a question of the point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus consisted in seeing them as they did from the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful men after long and often terrible journeys on the Decks of ships was seen.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue says to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever wish to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torches should not light the way, but hatred, who is their only source of power.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black Flows Scottish members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle remembers a time when only two holes had belonged to the team of Great Britain.</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance-directorate of the athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Advisory Board has a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">A record of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "Scotland developed something special in Scotland and to learn something from the world's athletics.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we figure it," "" "said Black." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the guy on the streetcorner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals-candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5.000 m stretch, while Eiliie doyle was elected by the crew to the team-occupant.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is rather modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "her captain's speech was incredible," "" "says Black." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were chottish or wherever they live or train, they went out of the room and felt very proud and were highly motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">"" "the passion and the real feeling that Eiliie brought quite naturally was great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth-Silver Medal, which is competing for the 5th World Championships on the 400-m hurdle, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 holes in the British team are.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">There was five British and two European records set up in the last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runners.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 square meters, is another Scotsman that you should follow after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers its first world championship that was the only different Scotsman in the team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">The Manners Captain tells that they are "enormous" on the fact that many of their compatriots will not only belong to the team, but in some cases also with the medals and the Finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing to be to the team is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so it's a great honor anyway, but to know that my team-mates have voted for me and chose me, makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "obviously, I am very proud of all the fleets which belong to the team." ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows only how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes, who want to get on pods.</seg>
<seg id="155">As far as my speech is concerned as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have just pointed out that in this situation we are very happy as we have a home circuit.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put on this home support and to benefit from it, that we are at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete and it's just going to be a great atmosphere out there. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Don't block critics on Facebook: ask yourself a public office if you can't wear the onating from voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something about a bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not last long until the newspapers smote him because of all, from the internal policies to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He plowed in the criticism, sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not have his critics silenced.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783, Washington said:" "" "the freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we will be guided by the sheep." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland under Governor Larry Hogan, who must work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on its official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberation defendant him therefore at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The stockpiling of the governors left the lawsuit as frivol, and the on-line comment was full of a backlash against "Na," and?. "</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," many people said.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like hoganese.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state which is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second-ranking approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hoganese is not a reactionary heat.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his hauness head following chemotherapy in his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the refusal of persons who come to the side of the Governors - which is a public forum that is officially designated as official and by workers who are paid by public tax-Dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post defended Hogans Sprecherin Amelia Chasse the actions of the Governors and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too simple to use the image of trolling or spammers or hwater-filled people who resonate online the vertex.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post was talking to some of the real people blocked from Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just genuine people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a pastor, not a trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profound.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest passed the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer, Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, MD., was not reasserting, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," wrote them in the commentary box "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I don't appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position at the same time, they are considered by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">What the employees of the Governors signified as "concentrated Spam-attack," would other likely call "intercacies."</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook-era makes it simple to cut a message by simply blocks a critic or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in previous times when you have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical comments, and to burn demonstrators or protesters.</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is exactly what exactly happening now.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official who is criticized by Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">"" "" "" "President Trump has blocked from Twitter-users who were blocked from his Twitter feed on Twitter." ""</seg>

<seg id="196">And Kentucky, governor Matt Bvin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of its use on Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">As far as Washington's time, Washington had a similar effect on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous mail-drivers proposed to his leadership.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius church: on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Bergkirche is invited to the old cemetery Areal in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July to 16: 30 at a Serenade.</seg>

<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth charity, can enchant themselves from this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors of Tumlingens.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini: "it is a unique village."</seg>
<seg id="471">In the year 1267, the St. Hilarial chapel was first mentioned in the Wurttemberg Mountains. Graf Hermann of Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen, with the Vogtei "to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the certificate, standing on the Tumlinger Berg, except the erstwhile parish church, also a splendid farm, belonged to the church or the Patronal Church, and not the other way around.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As comes from the description of the Freudenheim city of 1858, in addition to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, today still visible in the village of Tumlingen, the "Berg" of the Third, the glorified settlements of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Ancient maps from the period around the year 1600 were supporting these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The patronatsworth was born from the early medieval herbiome-law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A Lord who built a church, knitted and occupied with a priest, remained the owner of this church and could also bequeath this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Associated with it was the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor.</seg>
<seg id="479">Three altars were offered in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The biggest of the two bargs at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell set then for the first time 1692, had to be released later during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the windowes were pushed and the bells was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops in the vicinity of the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and top-chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church commenced in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius-cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from hearers.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hilary Church was broken down.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the snowstorm was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year, 1834, a storm turned the cherubby storm and half the storm.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the still existing turmite remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history.</seg>

<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can make sure the money freeze, so Neymar it writes and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the energy-rich officer of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to purchase a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but must be subject to legitimate revenue sources, which allow them to make the break-up secondary point in their on the football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini as part of his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that associations in their quest for success had taken enormous debt, effectively deceiving and risky to ruin, if banks or owners reared their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP moved from concentration to the debts of the clubs to monitor its losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The amendment meant that the business model was used, the Roman Abramovich, originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then managed to build a global brand - to build a global brand - to become a tougher business.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the recent three-year comparison period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses in the amount of EUR 30 million.</seg>

<seg id="1137">Neymar signed a five-year contract, so that the resolution can be refunded over the next five years in the amount of 44.4 million euros per year's financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hosted the PSG along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City with the most severe sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG has received a penalty of 60 million Euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which later was reduced to 20 million euros - and it became arranged that the Mannitates members are limited to the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA UEFA is on the search for clubs that could try to list its financial statements by turning their income through companies affiliated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Hungarian company could sponsor the PSG, if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not exceed the legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This happened in 2014, when the UEFA determined that the PSA's value was blown by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG Payments to Neymar concluded about payments of the Organizing Committee of the World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar have disputed that Neymar Championship drivers are to be held and a like-like maneuver for the UEFA regulators are easy to find out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The former sanctions against PSG means that the UEFA will still be more attentive to take note of any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>

<seg id="1150">PSG expects that Neymars arrived a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and tripod.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales after signature by at least 30 percent will increase.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going to see, and she tried to prevent Neymars guideposts by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>

<seg id="1319">Situated on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold their bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I searched for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I showed this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I have fallen in love with them and made an offer on that day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square footage was completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a shared layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne dam and a mezzanine to make the generous ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she instructed the Architectural Design studio Duck & Shed from Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill that utilise 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two spaces overeach other, leaving the architectural challenge to lay a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creative to solve the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel works is quite complicated." he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were intertwisted, without we needed to shift." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel on it that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement made it Refan to place two spaces in full height - with a lot of extra drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine floor a classic copper light window overlooking the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Gepiesailed gold furniture, silberne accents and vintage Serge Mouille illumination put the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to take him longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The kitchen feels the mirror of a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance we split units space for all seating area and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchen are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a guard.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went in it," explains Erfan of the stahlreinforced, furnified MDF-door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is important, so when you push the door is very easy to push." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could win extra 16 m ², an additional bedroom and improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the base space - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and generate a calculation based on the soil size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the ground floor and at the same time use high quality materials, which give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not love the electric plugs into the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"" "these are important, but they do not play with your heart." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself by good design and increased square footage of something absolutely stunning.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a 500 million dollar lease</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the Dynasty, a confrontation with one of the largest real estate imperial Victorias worth more than 500 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton-Football Club' and developer of Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets will be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul has been planning to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp rise above the separation takes place at the Supreme Court of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna the brothers met 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family was bought a shop at Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">He founded the Westco Eans family and grew into a chain of 160 retail outlets.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 to 85 million US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento that include the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">According to an agreement with their late father Colin - is described by Paul as the main operator and the dominant personality in the De Lutis - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul, about a third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A judicial record states that Colin property has the value of $316 million and Paul has in the value of 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The distribution of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem-point for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "those proposed by Colin proposed reviews have left him with what I held for the best objects," "" "he wrote in 2015 in an initial affidavit." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed placements took place the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business, of which Colin, like Paul Shachtman asserted him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argued that this is not true, but throws Paul in advance to manage some possessions incompetent.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early affair, which has been submitted by Colin, he says, he hope to put the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs rise in the case, with hundreds of sites with affidavits, e-mails and reports of companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and charter Keck Cramer, and with leading attorneys, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both sides to law firm.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs De Lutis and her husband's husband Luigi were the Italian immigrants who runs dairy bars and delicacy transactions dating back to the late 1950-ies and bought a shop in Brunswick.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood-property, in which Colin the first jeans store the family opened.</seg>
<seg id="1375">"" "Colin says he began from Westco, when he was" "" "in my last years of the High School" "", "when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, did hope to pass her property on her sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "Luigi has often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land," "" "wrote them." ""</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group, with Colin claimed that Mark paid $10 million and Luke 26 million in leaving the company.</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "both Luke and Mark were," "" "Paul says" "" "about the conditions of their financial division." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin has kept very back, though he was a former AFL board member and was a biography from the year 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend of the TV star.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media participated with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their attorneys.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Only Colin answered by SMS, to say "I can really not say much" because the case before the courts may be.</seg>
<seg id="1383">"" "" "" "it is very, very sad that my brother had decided to widen me and draw our family names through the courts," he wrote. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1384">In mid-2016 Colin wrote in writing to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother.</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father did not have wanted, that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute," he said and added that he "was still hoping for a solution."</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps of new staff is planning to restrict the media dissuction of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and have failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If yes, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new Chairman of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including reports of the news media - hoping to keep the boss on an even higher course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"" "" "" "when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of the White House, his first working day, he exhibited a major problem with President Donald Trumps, he appointed a major problem with President Donald Trumps, he would have fixed:" "" "bad news that got into the hands of the President." ""</seg>
<seg id="1395">"" "Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefing - because the president would make better choices if he would receive good information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring their media skills.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship on television dates back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when Candimp was upset because of a fair reporting, it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places that were convinced," said the former election consultant Sam Nunberg in February opposite to Politico.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote to the time that "the key to keep Trumps Twitter habit in control, according to six former electoral campaign officials to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady lobster."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that Trumps Twitter is ever" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe this campaign investigators do something we don't know - that Trumps Tweets would have no more fluff without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We probably will never know something about the tweets if the Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his associates were to manage it a few times, to keep away from him, their efforts have been worth it.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has consistently able to avoid that Trump's controversy creates.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem is that people in a white house that unites itself from competing parties, repeatedly try to drive their own agenda by promoting Trump material that possibly promotes their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of adviser to provide doubtful information on the president for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example which was described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say that Trump may respond to negative press sections, especially those who have shameful leaks, and that they will find out how they come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly that happened at the end of February, when someone hit the President malicious a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocation Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy secretary of Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a pile of leak in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was held from Twitter permanently on Twitter or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that in the past he voiced false accusations and revoke them in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started to ask staff about walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the Recycle ram."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive Self, and his adviser still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchangeable factors make the mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1519">In the Westantarctic, a giant iceberg has solved itself from the barely four-fold size of Berlin from the sweeps.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This distributed the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener-Institut für Polar- und marine research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The over a trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square-square kilometers are now driving north and probably will need two, three years until he is melted.</seg>

<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">How far climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">Since around 30 years, however, there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs of ice-monkeys in the region, writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in one fact.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this can also be connected to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now unbroken collagen was a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow faster into the sea and regularly breaks down.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>

<seg id="1532">A complete smelfeis was disintegrating there, AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes.</seg>
<seg id="1533">It also means a lot to do that even the Larsen-C-Shelfeis is in danger, as the more serious crested has not as far withdrawn as currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the iron plate can be found under tension and can be disburdened, if at a key point, a piece of dropdown.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melt from Schelfei and iceberg are not the sea level because they swim on the water and pushed out to ice as much water as it results in the melt itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the skirmishes also leads that the glacier can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>

<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, an expert on the estate research institution, CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively jeopardized because the plant in recent years has been exposed to impacts of climate change, which resulted in the spring much less rain and in autumn much more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the life of lavender.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underscored the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly Riodoce weekly meet, usually to meet their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt high officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists will discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children to the office, which in 2009 have the target of an attack with Granules, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Safety experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opponent, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and abdominal feelings.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug trafficking, politicians, businessmen, journalists, who are suspected to stand on the salary of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico be dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest period of violence, and throughout the country the corpses are frequent, more and more journalists are at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012. 589 are standing after attacks and threats under German protections and until now there was at least seven deaths in seven countries.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and her inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his many books on violence related to drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Its lack will be felt deep although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez which shows his midfinger with the word 'Justice, "depends on the façade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, bear T-shirts, who show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahuth.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, its nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although in 2010 a Sonja Office was established to deal with the crimes of journalists, these according to the Committee for the protection of journalists took only two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of killings, each year associated with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.</seg>
<seg id="1824">In Riodoce, they are still working to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are intrinsic and even though the terrain is still wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without any information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting on the discussion of safety has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"" "" "" "it is very silly to be wasting my time in this workshop" "", "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we do not know the Why, we mistrust all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive only a couple of blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla has been stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelve river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The richer drove in his car away and damaged it in the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to be free in Culiacan freely.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the world's bloodiest battlefields to fight the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of mixed, two-story stoleans for drugs of drugs which are larger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" if only a cardboard box has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes there have contributed two misunderstandings to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February the publication of a interview with Damascus Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaling cartels in war with Guzmans's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This release may have annoyed the sons' annoyed, projected revenue members bought every copy of the output as soon as it was delivered to newspaper-publishers.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second error was to force Valdez to force Valdez, after the confiscation of a different newspaper, which had released the same story to leave the country for its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues beamed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was active in 2003 as experienced reporter for Noroeste as he joined with five colleagues for the formation of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the dowry problem," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation because of the bold and honest reporting, and revenues and advertising took.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved it, hard to publish hard excellency tests without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the formation of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for their reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage on the persecution of the Mexican drug history, wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He voluntarily gave him that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "" "is a lifestyle," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeuento-TV." ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you need to take on the task which you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I would not want to be asked," "" "what did you do in the face of so many lifetimes... why did you not say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun-bird who was able to bleak like a dockworkers, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">You trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always bear his charge.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, go there always sitting at the same table there.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask, was his love to the routine of spoilage?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions on how they can do their work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they do not like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their canny and runways," to make drugs move.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high measure of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Your own instincts trust.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal that "smells like a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing is happened with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, such as he and others say, are in Sinaloa no longer - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Riodoce arrived for security reasons, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. days previously became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments for monitoring journalists and activist in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking at the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the federal government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-class district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of policemen who are the governor himself as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporter went to the mountain landscape, where the drug addictions have fallen in control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has built on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former known boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé with the government spending that concentrated on the hometown of the Governors.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group running in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, one block from the office of the Prosecutor's office.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it came to pass, so I was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug retailers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy maker, who ruled the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (Pri), which ruled almost all the political levels almost all of the century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several Pri governors were accused of corruption because of high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this eatery, including one where a son of "El Chapo" Guzman passed a military attack.</seg>

<seg id="1887">Reporters Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and passed the next morning to a demonstration for another journalist at the office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adamed disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>

<seg id="1927">Fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurs, who lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">His unbelievably well preservative state has researchers who describe it as "truly remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant-eaters is the best preserved fossil species of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was in the Suncor Millenium Mine close to Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something which lacked out of the surrounding cliffs, and resolved to see more specifically.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years working to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1.100 kg) heavy mezzling.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you can make only a little with the eyes flashes, you could almost believe it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature has to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it's going to be in the History of History as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this plant-eaters, although he is covered with a armor and resembles a changing shell, probably was threatened by meat-man dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The highly armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from carnivores, and used a sealing technology known as a counterbalance, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This could have been allowed to blend better into its surroundings and to evade its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by bigger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaurs made headlines in May and is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta with mitchelli after the Museumeletechnician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours to discover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell, and an international team of scientists, the patterns and the form of scales and armor about his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shading, a common defence method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising, since the size of Borealopelta is far beyond the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs was hunted by sufficient pressure due to meat-resolution dinosaurs, that evolution favoured the concealment of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras, or marches-animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which signaled that this Nodosaurs was exposed to a true struggle for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong bootable behavior on a massive, highly armored dinosaurs demonstrate how dangerous the dinosaurs beast of the Cretaceous had to have been," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skins also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs was maroon.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal upon information about his life, including his context-fourth, to find out what it eaten as its last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs died when he died, driven into a river and went out into the sea where he sank on the back to the seabed.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was as warm as it was today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much farther inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosshrier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with consistent skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"the result is that the animal today looks almost like in the early chalk season.</seg>
<seg id="1954">You do not need much imagination to reconstruct it. if you're just a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is on sleep. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time, as giant spatopoden, carnivorous dinosaurs, who were on two legs, the earth passed.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaurs was hunted by some of his furtive ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This belongs to the Acrocanthosaurus, an 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was vershadowed after the death in the sea and in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was in the Suncor Millenium Mine close to Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the self-held dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is entirely from the muzzle up to the hips.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3.000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch laces that rained from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores was pushed by the Western Canada, until a flooded river flooded into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the submarine tiredness of the dinosaur kept his armor in an exquisite detail.</seg>

<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost insensitive - which hung out of the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tups and hair cuts that were sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the prison of Fort Leavenow, where the former secret service analyst had an 35-year-old prison sentence, after having been secretly sprinting diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is A Becoming Stblance (An appropriate similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline coincided its expertise in technology, computer sciences and arts, and Manning, a transversum, and the prophesick, whose condemnation of Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithm analysis of DNA that could look for Manning, and from the 30 portraits, such as some intellectual comment might not only be the formability of DNA-data - the many modalities as they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has been openly spoken about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was condemned in 2013 for 20 accusations, including six violations of the Spiary Act, computer-fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison, her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a liquor, black-white self-color, in which Manning is obviously sitting on a driver's seat and a platblonde perforks carries - with which it was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of her 2012-Project 'stranger'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">They produced the artist's portraits of strangers of forensic artifacts like cigarette muffum and chewing gum, by extraction the DNA out of the waste to create an image of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when it received an e-mail from a newspaper magazin.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg with a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she was not able to visit this time and she could not be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea, and inquired if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarnated Muse were sent to incomparable letters that received several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created one of Shoa Kanungo illustrated Compressed images, "which was foreseen to convert a future in which the president would be converted into a sentence and would be able to see the exhibition in person.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was indeed only a few days after the book was released, Manning release after seven brutal years would demand in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happiest coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is even now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and Starkes, since Donald Trump's a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender forces, to find new, tweet ways to get the rigid divisions which he actually should fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg, after the weird timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a written art statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning with their oversized signature (the "i" in their surname is provided with a heart) an end of 'automatic fragmentation, whose basis is sex, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">In opposite wall her mitochondrial DNA sequence is a genius of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped, through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or Nukleotide after the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist) show how amazing, at least in biologically speaking, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people hopefully will take with us is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories, also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition that is stored in an own space is a page from above mentioned Comic-Novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning, as it appears with a robbery-efon in the hand from the disciplinarity of the United States as King Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2182">"in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-doping).</seg>
<seg id="2183">The Wada timetable was updated in this respect, "stated Mutko on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="2184">The PM commented the second part of the roadmap of Wada on compliance with the Code, which describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and recently published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">According to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause matters to Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2187">And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and Wada in the near future, "he added.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list is determined that the Russian anti-Doping authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the UN approved investigation by Canadian Prime Minister Richard McLaren.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Regarding the matter, Mutko said: "we conduct the investigation as our anti-Doping system has been trying to concede an error.</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"" "but there were no government programs, and we will not admit to something which does not exist." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2192">Mutual words voted with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-Doping Commission.</seg>
<seg id="2193">In discussion with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov had problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but then added: "we have repeatedly said that the report has controversial positions and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Nobody has to accept this report unconditionally, "Smirnov.</seg>
<seg id="2195">RUSADA was excluded in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal from the Wada on the implementation of doping controls in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2196">However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-doping (UKAD).</seg>

<seg id="2203">The start-ups that will help your organization to become not the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2204">Amy Errett did not want to measure luck with your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not function.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, very helpful or - worse - cheating.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers were not grieving.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">It has called people from the outside to help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is on the waxing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing of software, which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement, it enables companies to provide surveys, specification groups and demographic groups to offer employees anonymity and complaint-lines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow to bypass C-Suite managers and directly turn to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and FitBit for the pursuit of its health, but where is the FitBit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools used by companies to compete with employees.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she did a better idea of what your employees think and feel at Glint in the three years.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to Snap-surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers an heat-card of the company, which indicates a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low allocation results - so you can drill out why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that at the head of the workplace culture must stay, so that you won't be the next Uber that has been involved in scandals, since a former employee has published a blog post which describes an environment of harassings, in which those who have spoken.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as Glint this desire for an overview is a lucrative business possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and Compliance-branch could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, following the budgetary technical website Let's talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and recognize poor behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the Uber-Fall in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">As Glint, Converters can send custom-made "Pulled" surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and regard the warmth-maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline, with which employees can report a bad behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the main business guide is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the court of public opinion has seized the regulators" "", "said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that its employees are badly treated or is unethical, it can experience precious consequences due to consumers and boycott, workers "fluctuation and lawsuits," "" "Quinlan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has used Converters for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of politicians and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Previously, if a employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to submit a phone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to pursue the complaints of his staff.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Well, as the company rescent, using Converters, can be hidden problems, which were previously hidden by executives, who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or illegitimate internship, identified and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can get closer to this holistic, 360 degree view in the experience with employment," said Vitrano, which directs the risk management Group from Ruby Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders in employment law." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Company began to take ethics, values and co-workers commitment in 2002 to take after the accounting company Arthur Andersen due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But it lasted until the "social media" occurred to their right, "that companies recognised that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Converters offer your software as a service, and do charge the company with recurring fees for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that will have the approval of Venture Capital investors, who have both start-ups supported.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in funding in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, making the total capital raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">They increased $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its entire funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising, given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees are more expecting their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">Competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high salaries and interesting projects on wagers.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to feel at a company that belongs to their voices and that the work that you do is worth to make this company successfully," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience on LinkedIn, who used both Converters and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach Rendites, if their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise, commitment and use of the employees will increase, it's no wonder you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on staff commitment to experts in the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the administrator of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Indeed, if a company asks employee about your feedback, it may have an expectation that changes are on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the changes are not fast enough, or not at all, these disappointments can be labelled and provided.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kotst International, the company has seen himself too much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you do not follow the staff to ask," "" "have you really listened to?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">And whom do you not worry about why should I? "</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now performs monthly staff surveys, was able to initiate action on the same day if a problem is reported via Glint, says Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrating employees it was possible to reorganize several teams in the company through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, to organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">In Ruby Tuesday, the company will always receive new insights on the employees, and it hopes that in the long term, this leads to a better attachment of workers in a industry that is known for high revenues.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose man," said Vitrano.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"and if you lose people, you also lose customer.</seg>
<seg id="2258">And if you lose customers then you will lose business.</seg>

<seg id="2385">The race bus shuttle is a popular travel connection between the railway stations of Ilmenau and Rennweg.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it may not be any crazy, a new report comes across technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big matter.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotics) published a report on the development of sex robotics in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, empowering Professor for Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must begin to take their Ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye-color of the robot, his form of nipple and type of fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make themselves funny, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them a lot more frequently," said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuds have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions, which are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs" "" "and choose everything from the eye-colour of the robot to the form of nipples to the type or colour of its fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it is still disturbing, as many robots have the" "" "personages" "", "which would be a stepford-woman progressively." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuds have developed to robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties which they appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex-robots with pre-programmed personalities as "Frigid Farrah," who gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy gold has a personality, which is adapted to your personality as well as possible," warms the site of True Corion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So may them what you like, and they don't like what you do not like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day it also has its moods - quite like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "it can be tired, on conversation, or it can be" "" "in mood" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the lower female properties, the proportions on rape, if you have a step on Frigid (welcomes here: reshaping) Farrah is troubled, untroubled.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True the companion of Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator then why can men then not have xxxy?" it is on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or simply just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and their increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper into our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course have no sex robots, and while the FRR realises their rising popularity, they remain temporarily on the brink of consumption culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what permeates from the edge-zones can be in relation to the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or abusive until they are the free market for this permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is however a certain reason that these highly developed sex robots seem to appear during a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the White House who has praved to have women sexually attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrendous aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphical images, the sloped bodies and the extinct eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but in the moment this does not feel like a big jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robotics is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically feasible (if also with portnostar-proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their inheritance plans to make them feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, to the point when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots are not real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate or just get away from their companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background history, nothing that could interfere on independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words: they are counterfeit slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the speech of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney as the epitome of the healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a binseness of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. electorate, even families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the US newspapers with advice on how to choking with the horror of Trump's relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all supposedly reckoned to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trumps to bring together families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I chose this because my cousin, a left-wing poet, who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family, this week has visited me in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, anyone who knows them, including Republican kinship with which she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table that's certainly a good thing, but it annoys me in a wider context that this will also involve considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the resulting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all towards the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we talk of" "" "normalization" "" "and Trump, we refer to the cruelous possibility that most of us cannot repel us any more." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">"" "however, there is still a long-distance lasting long-term scenario, normalised in the Trump Republicans of the right wing" "", "which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself today by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's premier version of the madbook - the dog on the car roof, which looked at 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked at) - both compared to Trump in fact a very mild criminal offences.</seg>
<seg id="2438">If Trump is going, the next candidate of the Republican only be healthy to be able to qualify as immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my Cousine was in town, we brought our children to Karusally in Central Park, the biggest of the caravan of the New York Parkdepartment, and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crisp and the animals revolve to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and climate change brings it in strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city betrayed: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do the dream come true.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite clear about the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the Toppub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not part of it - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, central Park-carousel is still a strange magic experience, as there are two two year-old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s, and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have seen the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily no one asked him afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my road it's the same plus the option to tip the rating with a 15% gratuity - this to buy something over the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This leads not only to slowing down what a neutral exchange should be, it also gives pressure on the server to bring personality in a situation where no need is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor wife in the department store was excusable, while I felt tired of experience to submit my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius moved to hospital for breast cancer</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorius left the prison for a hospital stay for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year he was transferred to the hospital for the treatment of Schnitten, whom he suffered the prison authorities after a fall in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius condemned the appeal against a call for prosecutors on a appeal against a call by the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of the Valentine's Day in 2013 by placing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a nightly invader that hid himself in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal against the six-year-old imprisonment of Pistorius appeal to which they say it is too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The national prosecutor authority said that they will raise the objection in the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the objection may be heard in this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistarus works risk that his sentence will increase to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>

<seg id="2460">As the last of the Blumberger schools, the four-clerders from funs and Eplet-hofen were released into the holidays and into the further schools.</seg>

<seg id="2465">Bauer Arnold found a strange egg, and left it out of his chicken.</seg>
<seg id="2466">Instead of a chicken, a small eagle came out.</seg>
<seg id="2467">But the hope to make a chicken out of him, smote the eagle smashing his wings on a high mountain and escaping his wings.</seg>
<seg id="2468">After that, the classes showed three and four in the studio of Yvonne Frank a chicken stock.</seg>
<seg id="2469">The hens danced with the young Gockles, which bore them to the bet.</seg>
<seg id="2470">The eagles stand for the integration, said Shunammite Sitte.</seg>

<seg id="2483">Two Bulgarians were incarcerated for illegal camps in Greece, shared the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, cited by television.</seg>
<seg id="2484">In the morning of August 1, a group of illegal refugees was arrested by the police in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.</seg>
<seg id="2485">On that same day, they were released, while an examination is currently running.</seg>
<seg id="2486">The State Department reported that the Bulgarians later released.</seg>
<seg id="2487">The Greek authorities have exacerbated control of the free Camps and place each one that is found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose to substantial cash stocks.</seg>

<seg id="2490">Software update for diesel vehicles: what those affected now need to know</seg>
<seg id="2491">How exactly does the software update take place?</seg>
<seg id="2492">Will the diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion?</seg>
<seg id="2493">The most important questions and answers in an overview.</seg>
<seg id="2494">At the diesel-summit BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5,3 million cars.</seg>
<seg id="2495">You are supposed to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars of the emissions classes for Euro 5 and some Euro 6.</seg>
<seg id="2496">Euro-4-diesel or worse are exempt.</seg>
<seg id="2497">Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments:</seg>
<seg id="2498">Is the new action mandatory?</seg>
<seg id="2499">No, the software updates are optional.</seg>
<seg id="2500">"the compulsory updates before are valid only for the vehicles, the cheers software," says Anja Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="2501">Their retrofit has arranged the Federal Office of the Federal Office (KBA).</seg>
<seg id="2502">How and when will customers be informed about updates?</seg>
<seg id="2503">The manufacturers have announced a growing implementation in the coming months, but no exact date is mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Daimler has announced to write any person concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If any inspection is required, this will be done in their frame.</seg>
<seg id="2506">How long should the converters go on in total?</seg>
<seg id="2507">"difficult to say," says Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="2508">The company is dependent on the commitment of the manufacturers, as well as by political pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"" "" "" "after we have seen, voluntary companies do not act on the subject of the environment so far." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2510">How long should the update last?</seg>
<seg id="2511">Rearmament itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Time-consuming can be there to get an appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2513">What do motorists do, who do not drive a car of BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?</seg>
<seg id="2514">The ACE goes for the wait.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Most foreign manufacturers would have moved, so Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Well, does a massive price fall of Euro-4-cars?</seg>
<seg id="2517">The ACE has been feared.</seg>
<seg id="2518">But even in the regions, where driving messages can threaten.</seg>
<seg id="2519">So far in rural areas there is no value loss for older diesel.</seg>

<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister goes next year in Rente.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The place is already written - appropriate applicants are scarce.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Since 31 years Wacker Stadtbaumeister.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work still makes him great fun as he was performing in the press interview.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports on varied, but also demanding tasks that are waiting for His followers.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, it miraculous that no application can feed the requirements specification.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is currently looking for an architect or a civil engineer for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">So - taking into account the regular notice period - enough time for development.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Because Haslach is on behalf of the administrative community as undere constructors, the applicant needs to precede appropriate conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city definitely.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If they can no longer fill it, the citizens would have to drive to Offenburg before Offenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But the proximity between the city and itself is important, says Wacker that tells of a good working atmosphere, as well as a good mood between authority and citizens.</seg>
<seg id="2547">Over 30 years in office some important projects have accumulated while anticipating pride.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help to relieve IBD (inflammation-sickness)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can end for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study maintains exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition in the U.S. affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom 300,000, causing gastrife and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those affected are usually advised to relieve meat and milk products, researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins cause to develop immune-cells that promote a tolerant intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immuno-cells in the intestine patrol to make sure that detrimental microbes that hide in food does not enter into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells, which are capable of triggering inflammation, are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the sensitive tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">When the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it may result in a inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments was found that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell is found on mice that carry a particular bacterium in their entates.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the gemstones of proteins to dissolve the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial art - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice in their food the more they had of this immune-cell. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an in tryptophan-rich nutrition is tolerant, if the same system is infringed with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Postdoctorate in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance, when she found out that a group of studies had such cells, but another group of the same tribe that had not been accommodated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbiome of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, who normally live in the stomach-intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of the mice have been DNA sequences and six bacterial species were found, which were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing on mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in an sterilful environment so that they lacked a intestinal microbial and not developed these types of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria gained on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri have grown in a liquid and then resulted in small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on immature immune cells, which were isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">As the active component of the fluid has been cleansed, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan-metabolites which is known as the Indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers have doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of such cells grew by about 50 percent, but when the tryptopuses were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells like mice, and that most of us have to protect us through our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether Tryptophan-Side products from L. reuteri develop the cells in people such as mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory bodying.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "it said:" "" "the development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote, since these cells are inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially, high tryptophanvalues can lead to a expansion of these populations. "</seg>

<seg id="2715">The White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that dates the American production last month, costs taxpayers according to the military's data that have been left to the TIME magazine, up to 24,000 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky vH-3D, known as marine One when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Executive officials of the White House made a roundtrip out of all 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopter turned into Connecticut was exhibited in addition to a yacht from Maine, a firefighter car from Wisconsin and a forklifts from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in an fragmentary order or Frago, hardly 36 hours before the helicopter landing at the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to become aware of it because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility," wrote the commander of HMX-1 at the eve of the event of his superiors, deputy prime minister of aviation.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The news displayed that the helicopter arrived on July 17 at 7 o'clock in the morning at the South Lawn for the event at 15pm, and so long stayed until the turf between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on this evening was cleared.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if your departure from the White House would be delayed, due to the restriction of the utility you would need a second crew for the flight back.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original flight race was during the event by helicopter, while the security personnel remained the unit during the time on the plane.</seg>
<seg id="2724">The recordings provided by the TIME was not clear whether a second flight was ultimately necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits federal property rights for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Datasets indicate that HMX-1 asked whether or not the event could violate the destination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"one question that we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the Commander.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sound as if you are locked," said the Deputy Commander.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was designated as the official event by the White House and were not covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But also official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">At the event, the president gave an impetus for the reform of the health sector reform in the Senate, and he proached the effort to alleviate the government's regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The use of the plane which is known as Marine One or Air Force One, from politically favourable purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.</seg>

<seg id="2737">HMX-1 occupations often perform training flights in the area around Washington and in South Lawn, to set the U.S. President in the White House with precise centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="2738">When Trump was at the G20 top in Germany in early July, HMX-1 led to the White House 58 practice landings.</seg>

<seg id="2740">Helikopter units flew in addition to 11 hours on that day for "non-presidential support commissions."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that taxpayers were the burden for none of the other requites that were presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">He said a spokesman by Sikorsky, the company was not involved to put helicopters to the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">HMX-1 does not have a budget designation for the presidential election, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.</seg>
<seg id="2744">According to Stundentarifen of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DOD-Erateset is available for the vH-3D however 24.380 USD per flight.</seg>
<seg id="2745">Record of the unit shows the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of running the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the taxpayers' costs on the basis of estimates for the refund can be highly misleading," "" "said Walters." ""</seg>
<seg id="2748">"" "" "" "these estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs, which are included in the annual funding." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2863">Did the PSG Barcelona warned of three years before Neymar?</seg>
<seg id="2864">The site of La League may not regret its interest in Marco Verratti</seg>
<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain won't leave Neymar in its persecution of Neymar, after having issued an offer of £189 million to dissolve its open-cast clause, but have warned that Barcelona three years ago before the world empire?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer because the Ligue 1-Club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark, whereby Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After the end, Neymar becomes the most expensive players in the world and for the highest paid professional athlete of the world. PSG offers wages of over 500,000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is furious over the way as Neymar has forced its way to the outside, although there is always a source in the proximity of Catalans, that the club always has its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But the football world was warned against this prospect three years ago by the PSG President?</seg>
<seg id="2870">As Manchester City 2014 interested in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any association, who wanted to sign one of the best players from PSG.</seg>
<seg id="2871">"I'm not worried, because when they know that when they touch one of our players, then we will contact them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-report unloaded Pope Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report on the defletlement of Pope Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen is ongoing for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisants, spokesman of the reform Movement, "stated after publication of the German press agency, he expects from the former Rainbow Bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Benedict XVI, an apology.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church, when Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false evaluation of processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican paper "Osservatore Romano" is criticized that in the coverage of violence in the domains are measured with "two dimensions."</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the attacks in Regensburg we have doubts that this would have to be "shameful and shameful actions," but the "degree of media manipulation," said the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historians and a member of the national Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit to call the Catholic Church as a source of evil is already part of the day-day experience and preparing public opinion that is for normal to keep" "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Also Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis meant in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "one would like to go to the church and that is a boating groove."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "moreover, they pointed out that in her youth" "" "beats a very normal pedagogical state" "" "" "" "about children, as I was one was finished." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are making it unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on the decoders, pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrong, writes author and historian Michael Hesemann, who authored with Ratzinger the reminder, "My brother of Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he adds up the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report, issued by the Bishum Regensburg with the educative lawyer Ulrich Weber presented?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were killed between 1945 and the early 1990s, "with high plings" victims of attacks, 67 domspatzen sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">The final report says to Georg Ratzinger, which was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "in summary, he suggests that by Domkapellmeister R. used in many cases forms of physical and psychic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high Emotional action the punishment for students could also fall heavily.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "nevertheless, contrary to numerous other defendants, this is the fact that many victims were the general humanity of R., and therefore in many cases, despite violence they even combine positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Ezeemann, why the final report on the dispensity scandal made by the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger was relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr Eemann, the 440-page report on the "seizures of violence of violence, are befiederted with the Regensburger Domspatzen," gives a conflicting picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">For one, many students heighten his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as a cholerician and perfectionist who, who became handsome, if a domain was not related to a top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: when you make the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself, why the name Georg Ratzinger thinks about it at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is dedicated to eight sites for just eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of mutual or co-knowledge in the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also the violence at the front-school occurred outside of its activity.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You may pre-throw it, too late, or having taken first evidence not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the" "" "self-appearance" "" "for the high school, on which he worked, was felt by practically all the inquired as -" "" "salvation" "", "" "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus also the wide majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger also presents him quite an excellent record, "sincere", "competent" and "understanding," as extremely good-natured teachers who held the guys regularly with cakes, biscuits and chocolates and "always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about his perfectionist and his high degree of emotionality, which also already took to eruption.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only skate with chairs and put the keychain on the ground, but also earrings divided and too naughty guys who moved to the hair or ears, he himself already gave birth to years ago, deeply deplored and excused for them too.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his honor to salvation, however, has to be said that such educating methods were in the demand time, the 1960s and 1970s, where parents like teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding techniques?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it is actually involved in this report, namely the forceful sexual abuse and the ususes at the preschool, the admittedly are dredging.</seg>
<seg id="2926">You wonder if it's not related to his familiarity and role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just rushed to him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian pope, many, who have never understood him, are still busily.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In connection with the report we report a lot about the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen (Domspatzen).</seg>
<seg id="2930">"" "" "" "Georg Ratzinger is also put in the final report any complication or co-knowledge with regard to sexual abuse?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No single of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to be acquainted with the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dared to speak with my father or my mother about it," "" "said a sufferers in the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true issue in educating sexual abuse has been and is that most of the victims are not silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they don't even have to familiarize themselves with parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral leader, who would have been a career of perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do you rate the Domspatzen-student Ratzinger's role in terms of disbrews?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a beatiful student formats it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see... no case, in which he had had expected (Georg Ratzinger) timely findings and could have stopped the respective offenders.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd to accept that coming out to him... Buben pushy or clear or also rather opened, as opposed to their parents, internatsmanagers, senior teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "in this way, the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that in advance of the purposes concerned with the purposes and / or their environment, he could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As regards sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free from any fellow convictions.</seg>
<seg id="2943">He cannot be accused of him, nor prevented him or to have brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to associate its good name with these resisting crimes, as it was happening in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media a lot of" "" "violence" "" "was read by the Regensburger Domspatzen (Domspatzen)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is thrown off in the report. "</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed up to a giant melange from sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere, in the midst of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is precisely such a abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Namely, clean separate: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the domicatzen, between sexual abuse and violence as well as saying, we say once, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">It also deals with incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choir leader in the cathedral-season.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole terrible test of pedagogy, the cases, in which lad of sadist teachers were literally sent and maligned, and among them entwined, together, together, together, together, have to prevail in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom had Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger not to do anything, because he got the boys to face only when they were already high school.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on the one hand, like most witnesses, stress the topic" "" "Vorschule" "" "tabu." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly things."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the pre-record level for school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was already a discipline, but there is no sadist violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" "" "many victims were the general humanity of R., and therefore in many cases, despite violence they even combine positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">This is the most still the accusation to have a look.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report was able to define just two periods in which the states were reported on the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time 1970 / 71 when he began to establish itself and from the operations at a school where he was not and responsible (so the witness) wanted nothing to hear, and then again in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Only Georg Ratzinger before the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989, he wrote a letter to the Director of the Natzinger's power station, which the report was even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">In this he points out that he will continue to be practiced in the pre-school. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in the light of the risk of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was of course at a time when legal clarity was, as the examiner in Bavaria had already been banned.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that it occurred in a legal gray area, as each one of us knows well.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was also difficult for him to estimate where the persons affected may be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permitted border had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can also not say he had always looked.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the examiner in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Fürstin Gloria of Thurn und Taxis found it to be unfair to apply today's educational criteria for the then time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the "Snare of Anachronism," i.e. the danger of judging by the current moral things.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was vile at all times and has not been broken for what has been broken down at the preschool of adversity and violence at an innocent child axis, that is far beyond that time ago.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That is all very awful and I am glad it is finally working.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I must take Georg Ratzinger, for all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Its means to disciplining and punishing, so earchers and pull on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then banned, it has also kept strictly in mind.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which picture of his Rainapartist Georg Ratzinger has been" "" "My brother of Pope John" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject refine also to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book we are talking about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, told from his perspective, as played the domains, only a secondary role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not concede that he led a stricter regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even that must be said: without this perfectionist, without demanding unconditionally discipline, it would probably barely possible to form an institution of world-related, true cultural message of Europe and his musical tradition that went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With cookies and Bongo alone, you make out of unrusty boys now not even big singers and in front of every success, regardless of what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person have you experienced for George Ratzinger for the conversations with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I met Georg Ratzinger really quite well and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, rock-hearted, deep gullible and savourable people, from which you can't imagine that he could only do something about fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly receive, as many former Domspatzen are still alive, 23 years after his embarking, regularly contact him, read him, he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not forgiven him today, that he once was strictly speaking to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most domicts are grateful to him today that he enriched her life and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but yet a adorable respect, to which they still look up today and which they even worship them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clear: all that you props him are guardians that were then on the order of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overcome this time long.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intention behind this, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report that has just been published, relieved him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the decency is, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great earnings and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen (the Regensburger Domspatzen), finally in peace.</seg>
