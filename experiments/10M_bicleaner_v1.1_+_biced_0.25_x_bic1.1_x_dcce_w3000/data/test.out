&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghter said that she is shocked at his death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and destroyed the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on : I always put in drawers .
Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on must not always be perfect or successful .
this has clearly stated the Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ ambiguous .
&quot; I always put it in drawers or get used out of the outside label that I usually have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself don &apos;t have the desire to be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , these things are better to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on ( 47 ) can only laugh that it is considered &quot; Miss Perfect , &quot; as explained in the current Cos@@ m@@ opolitan magazine .
most like the ac@@ tress spends her time at home , on TV with lo@@ cker@@ em Dut@@ y and Mexican food , is in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to haw@@ kers , they bring the question of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; desire : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to be married or have children to be fully &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a children &apos;s play &quot; is An@@ ist@@ on as a single mother of two sons to see .
the film is on August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sports Pyram@@ id
his experiences on the horse are manage@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournaments in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a bit of variety with some colleagues on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , it was a first .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sports Pyram@@ id &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes , the horses remember their holiday evening , they hunt in the fast gal@@ lop home to the feed bird .
a kilometer at this speed , I am afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and with it the equ@@ est@@ ries ended up again .
on Saturday , Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament winners - again near horses .
he left himself with his family through the facility of the AL@@ RV , on a horse s@@ mu@@ le not even for photo purposes .
this was the first time in Aachen , and thus also with CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
German sports co @-@ operation passed the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a little Gala in the Golden Sports Pyram@@ id .
in awards it lacks the sympathetic athlete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ servic@@ kreu@@ z , sil@@ ber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already called it .
longer is the 18th pri@@ zew@@ inner of the sports pyramid .
in Aachen , he met the first winner of Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means very much to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social involvement &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger encourages the offspring .
and so he gave the price of 25.000 Euro right away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sports athletes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the excellent are the Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , der Tur@@ ner E@@ ber@@ hard , the Ru@@ ff Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the helm of Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the Spring@@ rider Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand@@ craft of Erhard .
many of these sports enthusiasts have come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustr@@ ative society mig@@ rated to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ az@@ za price went .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger maintained distance to the great animals .
Clin@@ &apos;s and Tru@@ mp@@ s Policy in comparison : IT &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
however , the two US presidential competitors , however , are in control and energy policy as well as in a basic demand .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical difference .
who , about the role of the state .
Tru@@ mp wants to keep that in doubt rather small and warns against how the state of economy can harm - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton plans to put the economy to death and adjust to death , he says .
in contrast , he himself would be quite different , maintains Tru@@ mp .
he will make regulations massive , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower taxes - for both individuals and companies .
Clinton said : the state has appointed certain duties to open , he has given rise to power and needs money .
therefore , the taxes would increase to the rich , she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
in that time , Tru@@ mp and Clinton have to be invested almost .
the Democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly denied by the state @-@ critical Te@@ as@@ y @-@ wing of the re@@ public@@ ans .
so on Tru@@ mp there could be no internal discussions yet .
the differences in energy and climate policies are evident .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal power stations and rebuild coher@@ ent production in the US .
oil production is intended to be possible in so far @-@ protected areas to announce the Paris climate protection agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton is intent on expanding renewable energies with their investment programme and demands : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , the two ri@@ vals are not too far away .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ fic trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
but at the same time , both of them want the US to isol@@ ate not from international trade - but just to better protect American jobs .
and they should then be better paid for example , calls for example Clinton .
the present minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a famine .
it wants to raise it up to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tru@@ mp does not want to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to go , then he says he should not be changed .
but the big discussion of the next few months is likely to be more likely to develop the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand is Tru@@ mp , who wants to relie@@ ve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics point to him , that the bud@@ get@@ ary deficit only would make even bigger .
on the other hand , Clinton , who at least demand from the rich , want to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any p@@ aired woman has experience with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is one for women who alone escape , almost already in everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen there are four women .
each one has a baby here , that is at most one year old .
one has put her little son in her arms .
he immer@@ ses with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother gaz@@ ed onto the table @-@ top .
until they notice they are observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ sing the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the business leaders of Con@@ dro@@ us , a carrier for social aid agencies in Bavaria , and deals with women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are whis@@ pered .
they live in Munich &apos;s north in one of the few de@@ central accommodations for all @-@ frozen women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment along with Pro family and the Mün@@ chner Women &apos;s help .
recently , it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - neither as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is nothing much to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any woman who arrives here has made their flight experiences with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee due to wars because they are persecuted politically , because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families want to send them to Europe as a hope of hope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women , there are other reasons for the flight : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many ste@@ al ste@@ aling from it because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , forced marriages , Hon@@ orary Ci@@ vili@@ an , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is what drives them away .
on the run goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the tu@@ gs demand a sexual act for example for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that as soon as they anchor in Germany , is er@@ re , told B@@ ahr .
even here , all women in refugees would often consider as inf@@ erior and worse .
this leads to about 90 percent of women who live in the north of Munich &apos;s north , trau@@ mati@@ zed , appreci@@ ates them .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women are so accustomed to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experience , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since she often fails to help , there will be more accommodations only for her , she calls .
in Bavaria the seven districts are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question whether from a similar project like in Munich in its competence area , some come with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken there is no such thing in accommodations of the governments .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , alone they were not divided separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Pres@@ ent @-@ president of the government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are in some communal lounge , or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommodated separately by men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published by the Committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that both men and women are hosting separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the privacy or the women and women are housed together , it may be too - constant violence against women come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
laundry rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women in the study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , how much women can feel this protection need , one can be seen at the And@@ rang , whom it is on the house in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have been speaking around , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily set up a second house .
general practitioner : demands for new working conditions
the assistance of assistance in general have called for their union to author@@ ise new working @-@ fight measures in their conflicts with respect to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has requested all of its advice from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC told that there was ministers failed to respond to the concerns relating to the contract .
assistance and medical students in July have voted on the ref@@ usal of a contract which was agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pers@@ isted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had remained silent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about problems that led the treaty was refused . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the light of the J@@ DC management board , the J@@ DC executive led to the proposed new contract completely to reject and become official new negotiations on all the issues concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board has set a formal request to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council in order to escal@@ ate a process of escal@@ ating working pre @-@ measures , which started to approve the beginning of September .
the disputes led that assistance in general thre@@ aten this year , the first periods in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A Ass@@ istance in Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came after a choice to reject the agreed contract terms , which were recommended by the BM@@ A .
he divided BM@@ A members during the meetings that took place before the vote through 5@@ 4.000 Ass@@ istenz@@ arians and medical students , with the fact that the contract should be beneficial and should be accepted .
following the vote , the Minister of Mr Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be forced to be forced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alliance of external sides &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gesture that ended up a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give hands and to proc@@ laim an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterparts in the gold @-@ pl@@ ated hall of the St. Peter &apos;s palace in reception , I cannot f@@ end with the expression that Ankara wants that reconciliation the most .
there was the handle , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile was driven narrow and he hardly was able to heat from , even for his backward conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Tayyip Erdogan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could no longer count .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old levels before the crisis , but can even improve .
on the next day , a newspaper described that Erdogan would have beha@@ ved so badly as if it were never a worst thing .
it seemed to me to suggest the opposite rather the opposite .
but one of Putin @-@ radi@@ ant , sustainable cool was that the President of Russia had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his performance : the plane of a Russian struggle to the Syrian border by Turkey .
Moscow has been w@@ alled by Moscow .
Putin shared and accused Ankara to please Russia into the back .
the failure was even bigger , as it was committed by a supposed friend .
v@@ eto@@ es restore it becomes difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months the state @-@ controlled media introduced a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed that the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
most seriously , the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdogan &apos;s own family from illegal oil trading in Syria could have benefited from the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has disputed this .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received an excuse by the President Erdogan , who he wanted to hear .
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
for Ankara the advantages of a cease @-@ fire is obvious .
Erdogan primarily needs all friends , who he can get , after the last month after a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat almost his office .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey tough - in particular the prohibition of charter flights , which usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast .
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when flights are recorded .
you count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean .
this week forec@@ los@@ ed the tel@@ ev@@ ised tel@@ ev@@ ised fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agriculture could be re @-@ imported .
a report in Ve@@ de@@ sti de@@ formed it to : &quot; tourists staying there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West as it was in response to the tried to be a weak answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the ongoing Gro@@ ll about the snow @-@ emp@@ t@@ lement of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ous to take advantage of the cool atmosphere and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian president in Ankara won &apos;t win a bonus in Ankara that after the attempted coup , I demanded support for the elected state institutions .
this is well @-@ evident for Moscow , it is a matter of fact that even a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the summit in this glorious palace by the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; two countries which viol@@ ates themselves from the West and treated badly and now beha@@ ved . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest difference between Syria , where Moscow has recently been the role of a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support conflic@@ ting sides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could signi@@ fy that after nearly three hours of initial conversations , both presidents on the press conference said that they didn &apos;t even realise the subject .
the President of Turkey deliberately abandoned it to reply to a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize it .
there is no clear consensus on where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect dis@@ aster , when NATO joins the Russian battle , it is certainly better that the two heads of state should speak at least one another .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside of Scotland no longer available
the R@@ BS trademark is to operate once more on a back@@ Office role according to the management board of the bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the brand R@@ BS combined with the global ambitions of the Bank .
the bank has since dist@@ anced itself since she had almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
at this time brand strateg@@ ist &quot; R@@ BS &quot; used to protect other end @-@ consumer records .
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds and sponsorship , from six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to the Wimbledon winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to put more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references are published , the de@@ central Head@@ quarters and the Con@@ cep@@ ting of Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for private customer business which will get more meaning - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and staff in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand will become our Invest@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we are now more becoming a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank was introduced to a global brand , R@@ BS has become a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say now that we do not pursue global targets but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our staff will work with clients among these brands .
R@@ BS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ing and that there will increase the perception of different brands in its sport sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop themselves to the Bank of brands , as we are asking ourselves in the inner ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the Chief of Management .
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cally for three years if we had said that we would be a great bank for our clients and brought them into these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can re@@ ci@@ ate these marks so I think that the time has come .

the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori ensured his 3.@@ 000@@ th British profit on Friday at New@@ market .
he continued on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which was trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with his second win the night a milestone .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , reaching the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester pig@@ let , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son .
the dre@@ im@@ ent winner of D@@ ett@@ ori , who did previously on G@@ hay@@ yar said , &quot; It is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional , because my family is here too
I am very happy about the fact that it &apos;s happening in New@@ market because I am 30 years ago .
it is not a big meeting ; it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a mund@@ ane Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am relie@@ ved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the ju@@ ble when he gets the victory at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ ey@@ s achieved the milestone in the obstacles - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the pen@@ sion@@ ed 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who finished more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a real @-@ time career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ dev@@ t , the ninth time Der@@ by@@ Winner had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 careers .
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey on the modern age and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone so far only a few in front of him .
it has style and is strong , but he is his tactical intel@@ lect that distingu@@ ishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma enthusiastic fans for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie some weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he would have collected 6,000 winn@@ ings if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and Groß@@ tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has ra@@ ined around 30 years of winning in the UK , which is great .
he has a vivid personality , which is good for a bri@@ tish race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from flying finishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the embodiment of British fla@@ p for two decades .
it was nerve @-@ wr@@ acking .
a whole bunch of big players , including his famous &quot; glorious seven &quot; in 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash , and received a drug ban .
three years ago , he had difficulty at first , when he returned from six months , but he showed an impressive formal strength to de@@ fy its branches and to return to its bri@@ bery .
and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with cont@@ ests up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ 10 years of age .
Russia President Putin feu@@ d@@ chief , Sergei Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin has released un@@ expec@@ tedly on his staff leader Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was a lot of years part of the closest confidence circle by Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed special officer for environmental and transport affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin it is that Putin without giving reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ivan@@ ov has placed his duties as president of the Russian Presidential government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been Ivan@@ ov &apos;s deputy since 2012 , was named to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he graduated from the renowned state of Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the message in Tokyo .
on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website it is called &quot; Russian ) , that he later was on the Chief of Chief of the governing council and the executive director of the government .
about his appointment he said to Putin : &quot; thanks for your trust . &quot;
I think it is the main task of the government to promote your work as a head of legislation on legislative bodies and inspections to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV broadcast@@ er on Friday , Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious elsewhere .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time of one of the closest associate Vladimir Putin and works like it for Soviet secret service , K@@ GB .
as a staff member , he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
during a meeting with President Putin that was broadcast@@ ed on television , both men declared that staff will leave his own request .
but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , there are only a few of it - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
is there the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
this is currently no one knows .
but the official statement - that a man who was once addressed as potential President suddenly would be based on Russian environmental policies - came across huge scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , who is quoted on the website of the Krem@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I had asked you early 2012 in a conversation , giving me this very complicated post - you could almost say - difficult post for four years to be placed .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential office for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
prior to before , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council , and as Putin &apos;s former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( F@@ SB ) , who deployed the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin came to power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted .
once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia for Putin &apos;s second term as a third presidential term of Putin could viol@@ ate the constitution .
but this post was taken by another , closest allies of Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president for three and a half years later .

Queens@@ i Cros@@ sing : bridge now associated with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion charter project should be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the Nord@@ deck of the Queens@@ Su@@ fi with the vi@@ adu@@ ct with the vi@@ adu@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected with fi@@ ves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four los@@ ures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cover b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which approach each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the brood @-@ section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , and 46 tra@@ itors .
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion charter project should be completed by May 2017 .
economic minister Keit@@ h Brown st@@ ou@@ st the site to visit today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the settlement ferry crossing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering with a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30.000 ton concrete and steel , which alone were used for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the driving between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the bridge deck is a vulnerable activity , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the total br@@ ink at their place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks is given today in Ros@@ y@@ th a t@@ onic for the deck , which means that the entire Deck is ready to be lifted up on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , Project Leader of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first deadline is a significant milestone in every bridge project .
in this fantastic project the closure of the forward @-@ looking high @-@ art and depression .
after installing the last stre@@ amer section and its connection with the North @-@ deck area , we had to then close the still existing gap on the north or country side .
this was achieved by dra@@ gging the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 mm south .
this was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity .
massive , as the vi@@ adu@@ ct is 2@@ 22 meters long , approx . 6,000 tons and at a rate of about 3 % had to be pulled up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hom@@ ely , as the toler@@ ances , which the team works , can be tiny -- on each side they inf@@ ested only a few milli@@ meters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; rescue in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown from their fishing boat at Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station was on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm , after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty to swim in security while their boat moved on from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and put the worst off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the b@@ ail@@ ment station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds the boat had already we@@ ather@@ ed out of its range until we were allowed to water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed from a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted over the age of 60 and was found in a Bo@@ je without rescue life@@ jacket .
they all arrived on board the cruise ship and were brought back to the b@@ ail@@ out station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men thrown into the water have good luck left un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat was available via a stop@@ over , but it sol@@ dered aside the bo@@ ar@@ ers of the bot by the person who controlled the boat .
someone has awakened over these men today .

who builds Braunschweig &apos;s cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Green Line : investors are supposed to be much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does one react on the bad news that Braunschweig will lose close to 1,@@ 300 different apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; action concept &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but argument is programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is not so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD parliamentary group leader Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in common with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas , in the future , 20 percent of all the apartments must be out of social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the cheap apartments can also be found in the stock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the great dispute in the city hall should be as viol@@ a : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you deal with investors to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make investors on such areas at least 10 percent , but as possible as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new city building programme , which will cost millions and is still to be financed , should provide incentives for incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the Left wants even more hard@@ ship for investors .
regardless of this , as Brat@@ mann , bah@@ an is a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market .
when implemented , this will be implemented for additional tasks in the construction administration .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the professionals .
but the programme is not entirely different : because the around 12@@ 60 new homes , which should be built anyway .
how can one equ@@ ates the loss of further about 1,@@ 300 different apartments whose support is going to run over the coming years ?
it will be 500 apartments only by 2020 .
to prevent this , so the bud@@ get@@ ary spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be bought out @-@ on ties from the city .
also , it would have to be thought to get apartments back to the price list .
this is possible in the West town .
in one fell sw@@ oop the problem solved .
in the Western town , for the end of the year , dates are underway .
around 1800 apartments you could get back in the price of affordable apartments there .
only : this does not want the owners , the residential construction companies .
because the number of social housing in the Western town is dramatically increasing , one away from the goal of so @-@ called inter@@ ming@@ ling .
a concentration of social @-@ weak in just a few bor@@ ou@@ ghs will not give it any more .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be no movement in discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Leader of Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have concentrated on more construction sites for family homes .
but what does not mean that there cannot be a compromise yet .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , that is worth
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
that teenagers and child are no longer going out for playing out , but rather prefer to spend their free time gaz@@ ing while working on screens , has been compl@@ ained about many .
Pok@@ em@@ on Go is about getting people from the sofa and make more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited on TV , then on video games and finally on smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters , initially created for the video games in the 1990 ′ s ( later a drawing series , game cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many phenomena of the pop culture , the interest of the game sank in the US , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries was moved by massive demand that over@@ loaded the server .
within days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users had as Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go out with their smartphone and look for Pok@@ é@@ mons that will be followed by a GPS if they were found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a scre@@ enshot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation which played the game when she was younger , closed the p@@ ahn and j@@ umped on the couch from the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the US the game has led to a considerable rise in incre@@ ments that puts the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person every day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ di@@ o@@ gram , an app for Apple Watch , tr@@ acked 3@@ 5.000 users recently , the Washington Post recently shared that within two days of launch of the game , the number of people followed , which sprang up every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it just looks the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns to health , people want to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because many public messages are boring to health and come to people who are miserable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the meaning of sport can not be over@@ evaluated .
who drives regularly to sport , reduces its chances to become contaminated with cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is , that it brings people to do something outside , that they enjoy fun .
thus , there are three pillars of health covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun .
some people are even closing new friend@@ ships in the hunt .
as always there are cr@@ ush problems , who have to always complain about something .
and yes , someone could go against a door .
what is it to be ?
it has taken a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ Bit had previously been able to track our activity , they gave us no reason to exercise sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be after the time .
however , on the basis of Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and helping many people in hunting , more active , f@@ itter and healthier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the D@@ ament@@ arium
forget the print .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all this im@@ mu@@ n .
dynam@@ ically on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the floor .
on all the line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympi@@ ad .
the 19 @-@ year American Tur@@ b@@ ent@@ iner am Thursday into the multi @-@ war@@ med title and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their total count of 6@@ 2.4 19@@ 8 was clearly in front of the silver medal and the &quot; Final Five &quot; team of the Russian Bronze medal in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bronze medal .
the American Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ ists on the Swedish release during the individual multi @-@ struggle women of the women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth hetero@@ sexual American company , who wins a multi@@ f@@ ender and altogether the fifth , while they soli@@ di@@ fy their reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all .
it broke out in tears earlier her end result was shown and her long journey was an end .
this success provides them in the same league as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years of her sport , 15 world championship - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympi@@ ad from 1984 Mary Lou Ret@@ ton of her said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast that I ever saw . &quot;
they had a last inspection in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a half @-@ dimension@@ ed expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered as a disappointment .
the American Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embr@@ aced after they each have gained gold and silver in the single multi@@ f@@ ender of women at the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday ,
Bil@@ es claimed the first medal on Tuesday , while she was at the farewell celebration of the team of Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a ru@@ dder @-@ sign .
although making it there , during their long journey to the top , never planned the future , this is not really true .
some of their bump@@ s - which included their typical Tum@@ bling pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
it is not a coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was adopted by assistant A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school @-@ flight to the gymn@@ asium , was used in Bo@@ or@@ man , became a force .
for the summer of 2013 , she has no longer lost a contest contest , a series of winners , which will stop as long as it wanted .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina did light by two rot@@ ations , sm@@ ashed the picture .
Schwe@@ be@@ bal@@ es and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ nen - in which Bil@@ es keeps the world championship title - lau@@ ded .
they brought back again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 in the swe@@ eping reel - and sat down with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man embr@@ aced it gently as they anticipated its end@@ ow@@ ment - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flow through Bil@@ es glos@@ sy red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision they once described in their collective book , became reality .
the achievement Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she was fighting for the third place , but the bronze medals in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke at Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year old team members had been called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her soil practice she gave to the audience Kus@@ sh@@ ie , overwhelmed by a com@@ eback that was sometimes doub@@ t@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the sett@@ ling T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old from the beginning of this week has very new meaning :
police : 3 victims in mass kill@@ ers when listening to music in the car
according to the police report that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl shot in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first series of series of Phoenix , while they talked in the car and listened to music .
Angela La Lin@@ er , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June while the car was parked in an entrance , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator made eight shots from a fire@@ power weapon , while he stood on the passenger side of the car , and then fled with another vehicle , is in the report .
the police dealt with that the triple murder does not seem to have been the result of a predat@@ ory , since the att@@ acker doesn &apos;t take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 in possession of any of the adult victims .
the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting were led to the investig@@ ator to become a closer look at whether they are connected with four previous attacks .
altogether , predominantly in H@@ isp@@ anic per@@ missions were killed in nine months in nine months , seven people were killed and two other injured .
&quot; it is happening in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , &quot; explained Howard of the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month .
it is assumed that susp@@ ects several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ant , dating from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to declare the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were perpetr@@ ated by the same mur@@ derer .
Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ it@@ alized due to their injury and died later .
Lin@@ er , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on the spot .
a witness given to the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report about the shooting , which took off on an empty Pick@@ up truck a half hour before the three @-@ fold murder and assumed that it was the work of mass mur@@ ders .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ age le@@ vers and secured a bul@@ let from the seat as well as ball frag@@ mente from the engine .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
as most 6 @-@ olds love Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to the singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the least of his age , Edmund micro@@ cephal@@ ia has helped the result of a genetic disorder , about which its mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during her pregnancy didn &apos;t know .
when he came home the first time , my first thought , I made it not .
I don &apos;t manage this .
I have not let myself down .
which is not right at all -- of course , one has settled on it , &quot; she said .
your husband Vincent and her has been told that Edmund will never be able to recognize her , and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer to this was &quot; I didn &apos;t know that the people still make , &apos; stated Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund can work with the help of a wal@@ ker .
Edmund could not sit nor craw@@ l up to his third age , and he still cannot speak .
but he is making steady progress .
he can run with support and cycle .
he loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the drawing language that Edmund for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing me something ahead of me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring him a sign in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Edmund has invented a number of characters alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as at Edmund , and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the cla@@ de during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect life with the Zi@@ k@@ avirus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to is reminiscent of the emotional price of a certain future .
I asked , what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and it still does not know yet .
I haven &apos;t asked for a prognosis for a long time because I am not expecting them to really say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hope@@ ful advice for mothers of infants suffering from birth defects that were caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avirus .
it will be better .
they know that it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
violent rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives rise to b@@ ail@@ ments in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Mississippi
fierce rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floods in Lou@@ isi@@ ana tw@@ ined the governor , on Friday the not@@ with@@ ered . it will all be counted all Saturday with more rainf@@ all .
numerous rivers in southeast Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Mississippi were flooded with the shore and threatened with large @-@ scale floods to extreme rainf@@ all , reported to the National Mills .

Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ person for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ l@@ et General , shared with that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags .
Ste@@ ele said that only the Municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa ten thousand sand@@ bags would have requested .
a floo@@ d@@ war@@ n@@ system is used over a wide range of parts in the south Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather permits der@@ sil@@ ently that an additional 3 @-@ 5 inch can be dropped in this area .
in the south of Alabama , a fleet was deployed in the south of Alabama , while the Mobile continues in the region .
the river Com@@ ite nearby Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the Am@@ ite River near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are all likely to be reached via the weekend of record high@@ ones .
the me@@ ter@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could pass many houses in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that an up@@ stream moving flood in Ascension Par@@ ish represents a danger , as these over the beaten rivers are slowly flowing in the Lake Mo@@ rep@@ as .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ v , south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09.@@ 00 , which was ever recorded .
rescue teams still t@@ apped people from the Fl@@ ut@@ water in the bor@@ ou@@ ghs of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kinson south west from Mississippi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step @-@ son , were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ be .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which usually lies more than 400 feet from his house , overnight strong increases .
he said that he would have warned him another step @-@ son who lives nearby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have awakened and the water flo@@ cked and flowing in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife said to ford that she lived there in the 48 years where she lived there never had such a strongh@@ old of the river .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members have all the disability , and he is the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ th@@ el@@ ves had saved all three in a big military truck and brought them to the nearest fire@@ wall in Glo@@ be , where they were accommodated up to Friday .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding had spread quickly , as it still existed heavy rainf@@ alls and , that authorities take into account Ev@@ ov@@ ation instructions .
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the ground by the rainf@@ alls have been significantly completed since Wednesday .
the authorities show that serious rainf@@ alls and road@@ side floo@@ ding the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and school at five levels .
the C@@ BS @-@ subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a two @-@ rate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 is in@@ und@@ ated houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated to two churches , which were now both flooded .
the ruler of the community Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities would have saved 72 people and seven pets that were fl@@ us@@ hed from the flood .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , there were well @-@ accommodations to accommodate the evacu@@ ated ones .
&quot; once the water starts to go back , they will be able to go back to their homes , &quot; he said .
in the town of Ham@@ mond , the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa were closed almost two d@@ utz@@ ing streets due to the flood of water and have prepared sand@@ bags for the residents who hope to hold the water out of their homes and shops .
&quot; the last great flood that we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy land@@ rum from the city administration .
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Mississippi , the vice manager Ru@@ pert L@@ utz said the Harrison coun@@ t@@ ys , that it continues to be ra@@ ined at the Gulf Coast .
according to his information a handful of houses should have been reported as in@@ und@@ ated on Thursday , but on Friday they were not reported .
Keit@@ h Town@@ son , manager at shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the police shares that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy has been shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child has been shot .
the grandparents of the boys identified him to C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grandparents said that Brown has suffered several sho@@ cks , including in the ley , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was in consciousness with his transport to the hospital .
&quot; he did a lot through , his small body was clo@@ th@@ ed by sco@@ oters , &quot; shared his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ch@@ z the transm@@ itter .
I simply cannot believe it .
the condition of the boy was regarded in a hospital as a critical and had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy told the transm@@ itter , that he is likely to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
also shot three men : two at the age of 29 years and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in stable state .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old which is located in a critical condition , has been shot up , reports the transm@@ itter .
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police are determined whether under one of the most recent men of the perpetrators .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems to have come about a cross@@ fire between several guns .
Pat@@ ron@@ age for storm @-@ tubes , which were trac@@ ed to different stor@@ y@@ line fighters , over@@ se@@ wn the scene .
it seems that this is clearly an ongoing battle .
on the road , on both sides of the side@@ walk , we found sle@@ eves .
thus , it seems to have been here several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; shared police officers and Gin@@ al@@ di police in Philadelphia .
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area met .
there was no fixed and the police are currently checking the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl met by a qui@@ ver &apos;s arm when she played in front of her house in the West O@@ ak Lane neighborhood .
she recovered and the police are still looking for a susp@@ ects .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I present to me under the women &apos;s pregnancy and that for more than one reason .
first , I have been in each summer months since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three turbines , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspired by many young girls of other colored skin .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the J@@ ew is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Catho@@ lics , turns every day off .
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was one of the female Tur@@ ner@@ ers an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year were Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising olymp@@ ic winning player in America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , how they expected unexpected , but master@@ ed g@@ ym@@ astic routines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , hetero@@ sexual American woman who won the gold medal at an individual Sever@@ e event .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but we do not see sport classes all over the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie sm@@ s all the same route as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison , to create it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; last Five &quot; because the next Olympics will only have four Tur@@ ner@@ ers in the crew . besides , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer .
but the reality tells that Tur@@ ning is a more expensive sport and Tur@@ ner is primarily granted in private gymn@@ asium , which can be maintained by parents for training , furnishing , travel and Hotel@@ es ( for the coaches and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of these turn@@ around lie in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support business .
in these verses the Tur@@ ner get their entire training and that is a expensive and long @-@ term commitment to families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer by Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both their athletes , since they started with the tower .
we have to get inspired to the churches au@@ n innumerable , young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a high @-@ performance and easy @-@ to @-@ reach turn@@ around .
I was founded my turn@@ around for 20 years .
in my events we have provided free and affordable turbines in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international vic@@ tors .
in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hometown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality turbines that earn the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
Tur@@ nen develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team to bring thousands of young girls to care for the sounds and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in the sport , especially for girls .
it is such an exciting time .
thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en des Olympic Mann@@ ing , and thanks , F@@ ass her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
Ass@@ istenz@@ dges would like to organize more strikes after Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t proposal was rejected
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting a re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.000 Ass@@ istance arians who voted in a choice but refused him .
in July Hun@@ t had unvei@@ led plans to introduce the Treaty of forced , and said that the N@@ HS was ordered in a &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; and had any further delay on the employees and patients .
the first assistance in general are intended to obtain a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend work , to improve the care of formal movement times .
DR , Mc@@ Court , the President of the BM@@ A Com@@ ments for Ass@@ istance , concluded the last night in a communication with : &quot; Ass@@ istance arians have resulted in serious concerns , particularly that it is the current staff crisis and is given to treat all doctors &quot; rights . &quot;
in just eight weeks , which remain even more , until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time is running out .
efforts by the BM@@ A should be part of the dispute through conversations with the government on the reluct@@ ance to participate and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
it happened to the say that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had only done this last month , that his door was always open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must now act , lift the pre@@ condition and appeal to the concerns of assistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should he not do this , we have made it obvious that they are prepared to carry out further work measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a surge of nearly 13@@ ,000 co@@ operations and 100,000 providers , since nur@@ ses and specialists were included to provide doctors on the strike chain .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by having an acceptance of the re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better wave of compensation for the 5@@ 4,000 psychiat@@ ry , which will be subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director @-@ General of the N@@ HS employees , demanded the assistance to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working fight measures still reach nothing of the little , but have already over@@ bur@@ dened teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nursing care and their families just worries , hard@@ ship and interruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the past two months we have talked to the coma of assistance and assistance with the Ministry of Health and other ministries in a positive response to the concerns regarding tut@@ el@@ age and wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
the employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training courses and the gender @-@ specific salary in medicine - a sign for this , how serious it was employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day @-@ - medication which can lower the heart attack
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug , after recommended by the authorities to ad@@ minister this more people for a longer period of time .
the cl@@ ums@@ y medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attack for people with a heart disease .
the drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thus reducing the risk of a stroke or a further heart attack .
the N@@ ICE regul@@ ator N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS was recommended for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ ICE regul@@ ator N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS was recommended for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
some 14@@ 0.000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of it suffer a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attack and stroke are caused by sei@@ zes fatty material in the arter@@ ial walls , the expos@@ ures .
if the t@@ opp@@ ings breaks , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that causes the flow of blood to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots trig@@ gers , it can flow through the blood stream and cause blood flow to the brain , which causes a stroke .
individuals who already had a heart attack , are subject to a higher risk to another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ zen@@ eca and is distributed under the trade name of Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely .
the guidance of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE health @-@ technical evaluation Centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack , a further heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or combined with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing further heart attack and stro@@ kes with people who already had a heart attack .
by a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased to be able to expand the options of treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the effectiveness and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the blood risk - is limited to a period of up to three years . the guidance design does not recommend any treatment which goes beyond that period .
culture of the Political Cor@@ rec@@ lav can b@@ lossom in Muslim areas
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on dis@@ miss@@ al of a government report because of corruption from the office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ lav has led to that far @-@ spread bal@@ ancing in Muslim communities will know@@ ingly ignore like a annihil@@ ating government account today revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cabinet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; member Sir Eric Pick@@ les accessed the police , electoral observing and Town H@@ alls to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse , due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exagger@@ ations regarding eth@@ ni@@ es and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former minister of integration and local government , which is now a sc@@ rup@@ ting corruption , said that intimi@@ dation of voters from religious moti@@ fs would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set de@@ mining tapes outside of electoral rolls , to protect non @-@ legi@@ timi@@ zed voters .
it is recommended that voters must guide an opinion with him in order to prove their identity in elections .
at present a vot@@ er must call its name and address .
the report proposes to not irrit@@ able ink on the finger of a person , when they give their choice to prevent somebody choose twice .
wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
it calls for the press to have more access to municipal rights and decisions of not official com@@ ets or groups of work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only used against electoral law , but is also to protect the local government before the broader corruption and financial culture , which is associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street , as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets Elec@@ sk@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special optional court decided that the acting Mayor Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man , after a L@@ itan@@ ei and illi@@ cit practices of his ministry .
the Court was that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ple@@ ated the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ tic fashion , &quot; and had brought to silence his critics with apartheid and Islam@@ ophobia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man ought to have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the rel@@ ati@@ ous duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either doub@@ t@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation , where one person chooses as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of sc@@ ams all over the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he expressed particularly alar@@ ming in frau@@ dul@@ ent correspondence , with the older members of the Muslim community to have pressure on people to choose a candidate of their election . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric , illustrated , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the feeding of out to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; as proof was attached that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been practiced particularly women and young people in order to choose according to the will of these elderly , in particular communities with Pakistan or ban@@ anas background .
&quot; there have been concerns that ... state institutions such as such behaviour due to &quot; politically correct &quot; will not have ignored hyper@@ sensitivity in respect of eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations in order to clean the system , including the ban , that political activists are dealt with letters , in order to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ ap &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ ap &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also calls for tougher registration tests to prevent the list@@ ener to immigration and social welfare purposes .
consider options to ask voters prior to choosing to ask for your ID .
not able to use a finger on the finger of a person once she has given her voice to prevent any one chooses twice .
systematic inspections about the nationality of a person perform to make sure they are available either .
a three @-@ year limit on applications for an automatic ou@@ di@@ aling code .
prohibition that political activists deal with full @-@ elections and envel@@ opes of let@@ ter@@ ers .
the police have authority to set resistance to electoral stations .
a policy change which caused an indictment for intimi@@ dation in accordance with the &quot; representation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s representative Act 1983 ) .
photography amongst pol@@ ls .
request that only English can be used in the election stations ( excluding Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to make sure the employees will assert that voters leave alone in the electoral cabin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and find it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets fall there was no sanctions issued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Parliament has Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a l@@ it@@ iting of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been sufficiently known due to a number of reasons for sufficient , according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings - criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; waste @-@ controls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the electoral divisions of the Town H@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judgment part in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments , but the worrying and co@@ vert propag@@ ation of ball@@ ots and denial of certain authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger and other famous Doppel@@ gänger of Olympi@@ as sports@@ men in Rio
fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio are held this week by the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot except margin and band that proved to be impressive double in the Her@@ zo@@ gin of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ ad is far from being the only one , at gold batt@@ ling Ath@@ let , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not , unless you believe the social media faith .
in hon@@ ouring the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , which fli@@ pped at the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olympi@@ ac@@ ters who have more than only a certain similarity with Hol@@ ly@@ rical celebrities .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared to his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o .
except for dou@@ ble@@ at on the bicycle @-@ r@@ ink there are many people on the internet at the same time , like a certain arch@@ ers of the Di@@ dy@@ e of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be .
the team member of the team team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures , on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ secretly .
in fact , the ar@@ cher was given the madness in the social media and gave it to hear that he has been hearing from childhood for his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I myself see no big similarity with the exception of the facial hair , &quot; said Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; he is a well @-@ looking guy , so I hate that for a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly come into the center : the conclu@@ sive similarity between the British for@@ fe@@ eder Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its large , expres@@ sive eye is supposed to be able to pass for the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh for years compared with the painter Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
one course higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Theater
a further sustained comparison was moved between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver Medal of Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova presents more than just the sun@@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair as the ac@@ tress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne McC@@ ord , while the Americans attacked Nathan Adrian von Fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter ac@@ tress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others have also noticed the similarities !
theory in the room : according to this user there is perhaps a reason for the similarity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter U@@ ser@@ in explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the U.S. foot@@ ball@@ star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter ac@@ tress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter an incredibly similar facial form and eyes .
more popular Compar@@ isons Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is nearly identical with the ac@@ tress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal in the Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , big smile , resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

the comment@@ ator B@@ yron Mac@@ Don@@ alds thought that his microphone is switched off as he rel@@ ay to his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m Fre@@ isti@@ ller .
Mac@@ don@@ ald that was brought to board in the commentary box on the C@@ BS to give more &quot; color &quot; could be heard : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old chin@@ ese has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , went off like M@@ ief , died like a pig .

the idi@@ ot has not broken that they were still on show . &quot;

the criticism of B@@ yron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard , where many were presented to him in the speech
Twitter User did not return , when they heard , how uns@@ ensi@@ bel B@@ yron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter @-@ U@@ ser@@ in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you re@@ pro@@ vision@@ ally the C@@ BC and Canada and leaves us all look like rac@@ ists . # t@@ opped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC programme , live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we apologize that the comment has been broadcast over a swimming output . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a miserable chosen formulation , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC in@@ quired about 90 times at the people who responded to the crew about Twitter
the comment@@ ator Col@@ ony Scott Rus@@ sel had to apologize to the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC @-@ merged and imp@@ aired his ap@@ ology with more than 90 other Twitter users , who had compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network also exc@@ used quickly and gave a communication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we de@@ pl@@ ore it sincerely that these statements were made and that it was made possible to be broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yesterday we quickly apologi@@ zed to our audience members and our audience members .
to clarify , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
nevertheless they were un@@ reasonable and a unhappy chosen formulation . B@@ yron is doing what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald held in the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment that I have done after the women &apos;s flo@@ rel@@ ay in the C@@ BC Olympic message , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I took me on the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and did not refer to them as a person . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark indign@@ ant about women who res@@ am@@ pled in the middle of business under@@ wear
the shop@@ pers did not know where to see , when a woman went out her clothes in the midst of a mark to im@@ itate sub @-@ pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation , they insp@@ ected how she saw it , she pulled off and put her back to the shelf .
you browse further and tasted four pairs of sub@@ tro@@ users in a shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone in which the woman tried the h@@ osen , before putting her back into the shelf
a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ dson , who at the same time was in the business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , she moved back and left the store without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the stalls they had a pair of under@@ pants from the reserve , extending their own gar@@ ghts and pants and tried them out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat more discreet place to do it - she was just there , che@@ ek@@ as like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; everybody star@@ ing out when she pulled up the under@@ pants , who obviously didn &apos;t like it , because it put them back to the shelf . &quot;
she reiter@@ ated the same with three other under@@ pants before she decided that you didn &apos;t miss anything that went back and out .
&quot; she didn &apos;t seem to bother that she watched anyone - or about the person who would buy the under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you think he would take home with a different person who had not been washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson has added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have been with , the employees have tried to draw the garments from the sale , after she went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and finding out that another woman had she and again and she didn &apos;t have washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man from Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is the incident that occurred on Tuesday , August 9 in our branch in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Folk@@ stone &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect yourself against Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from arms attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail.com could make it a bit safer for you .

regardless of whether you approach you from the front or behind you , this video will show you how you shoot the mirror for your rob@@ bers .
if you sow them from behind , then you should turn out to be one , so you can see your att@@ acker and move out of the line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
seize the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ bow to your face .
hit him then with his knee in the bar and rot@@ ate , while the att@@ acker fights against pain , the weapon from his hands . hit him with the run and move back@@ wards while they turn the weapon to him .
with att@@ ackers , which approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the line , grab the gun and rot@@ ate it , so the Att@@ acker can &apos;t shoot .
shifting the weight on the gun at the same time and hit the att@@ acker onto the chest , then turn the gun from his grip before they move back@@ wards and turn the weapon to it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it Miz@@ ra@@ chi Vor@@ ob@@ serves .
but remember that it is the safest in the safest , to exceed your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
Reis@@ er Ian Wright sch@@ ab@@ t for a guide to his tongue at the dirty places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller moved its immune system and wor@@ ef@@ ef@@ le@@ x a serious test - by sc@@ out some of the dirty and dirty places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k cut off his course on a Euro @-@ Sch@@ ein , a rail@@ road on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a flush kno@@ b of a mig@@ r@@ atory bur@@ dock , as well as a public telephone in Russia in order to demonstrate the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
in front of the deri@@ vation of each object he used a L@@ umin@@ aire to show himself and us to what he is going to get into .
but the experiment , which was fil@@ tered under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to day@@ light .
the thought , the r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ b of a mig@@ r@@ atory bur@@ dock , which was already used by thousands of others , may be totally rep@@ ul@@ sive , but actually inside a kitchen sink more poor bacteria .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals concerning the support of bo@@ wel bacteria as well as his own health .
fortunately he left nothing , which he stretched out , more than a bad night taste in the mouth .
Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ine by looking through the world and ate beautiful things , as well as wonderful things .
from public places in stations to train stations to r@@ ins@@ ure toilets , the task subjected its immune system definitely under one sample
in the film he told me : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and s@@ laugh@@ tering water . &quot;
in the film he was able to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his prob@@ ation@@ ary did show a L@@ umin@@ om@@ eters from over 4000 units .
compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ om@@ dom@@ eter is freshly washed out of less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to dis@@ guise after her L@@ umin@@ om@@ eters over 4000 units were , while fresh @-@ ru@@ ed hands become one of less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel @-@ off &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it comes to the worst thing that I have found in a res@@ tro@@ om &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing distr@@ acted as that !
I will not touch here anything , because it is dirty here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the Company is equi@@ pping Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both Mil@@ k @-@ bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of bo@@ wel bacteria and immune system .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer something new .
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explained the benefits of probio@@ tics .
we did crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings that did so that we said &quot; L@@ ass to call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of just talking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the Director of the film , added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he would ign@@ ite some of the things I instructed him to learn , just like the ec@@ cl@@ assy Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , there were things in which it was easier to put Ian Gillan , to lick it and others where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad we have recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in one of the survey conducted in 2015 , 84 percent of all respondents carried out milk @-@ acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of the stomach and the intest@@ ine and 58 percent , they said that they are at least occasionally present products containing attached milk @-@ acid bacteria .
A@@ social family destroyed in front of Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ster@@ y in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left her social apartment after a del@@ usion with a damage in the amount of £ 50,000 , because it had terr@@ orized its neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ lik@@ cock have been thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after being removed from their property , they found their property in an irre@@ par@@ able state .
the walls presented cla@@ ve holes , wooden di@@ mp@@ s were destroyed , garbage was disper@@ sed in the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls .
the family were res@@ trained and it is thought that she now lives in private accommodation .
Don@@ na Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the house @-@ management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she fears that the apartment was no longer repair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an absolute nightmare for people here and I believe that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider , as this property is thought to be considered as a beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is it also .
the couple had three sons , the meanwhile lived in the apartment , and the police said that the terror that the family had inf@@ lic@@ ted , road fights with bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ists , frigh@@ tening of residents , drug abuse , drug abuse , drugs and floods .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , was in June an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour .
in some rooms of the house that will be demol@@ ished under circumstances , old garbage was found
it were tra@@ ded in the property , in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden ri@@ mp .
neighbors said that they had to fight them on the road and had to be inv@@ oked by police regularly .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ gi@@ ate her and her partner this week for@@ ged by the property , after giving them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ans were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors that said that their life was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they sho@@ ved to no one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years in addition to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we could not sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not familiar !
now , where they are finally away , it will be nice .
Adam Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it failed the family to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called in regular intervals , 20 years long
at the covered side of the municipal house , rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were hin@@ dered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that there is the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their families , as a del@@ usion is always the last step , including Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a very difficult case since the behaviour was extreme and its actions for their neighbours had to be dre@@ ad@@ ful .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have been brave to us and have given us the information to come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this development will don@@ ate sol@@ ace to some neighbours and gives us the message that anti @-@ social behaviour will not be tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons were living at different times in the house , but they all were over 20 .
a dirty mattress , which let in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ usion on the ground
workers of the house @-@ government will now need garbage mountains , who surround the house
in 2014 the police led a raid on the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as guards , par@@ ap@@ per@@ es and cash at the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don got a fine penalty , after having found guilty of own@@ ing a drug of class B in commercial inspection .
they claimed that money was a tom@@ bst@@ one of their son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after they were without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many of the rooms of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they will destroy rent@@ ers , who do not stick to the house@@ keeping order .
Angela C@@ row from the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall dealt with that the del@@ usion had a clear warning to the other tenants who do not stick to the car@@ n@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can act without self @-@ vision as well as those who have been damaged by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate a criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour , which continues to collaborate with partners to protect our communities .

the 27 @-@ year @-@ old killed on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a unilater@@ al finale its Land@@ smann and &quot; tit@@ le@@ holder &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5 : 4 ) .
thus &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam won the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour @-@ Fin@@ als and just about Olympia .
bronze went to the japan@@ ese Jun of Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese have made it as expected in the end@@ game and made the title to each other .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympic stadium was the former SV@@ S @-@ n@@ ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record alone , between sets and time @-@ outs they had no co@@ aches in itself .
they had withdrawn on the ble@@ ach@@ ers and left their backs at a fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mat@@ ches up here I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the finals I am playing for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had said Z@@ hang . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the Parti@@ e posed Gold@@ - and silver Medal with the China flag .
the match itself was unexpected .
Ma had to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first sentence .
afterwards he determined the pace on the record , and turned out Z@@ hang out only a total of 13 points .
due to the superiority of Ma was not developing the unexpected match .
but nonetheless , there was enough stunning air changes .
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the game of bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ ans had joined the ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov in its quarter @-@ finals against the German Europ@@ ame@@ y Dimit@@ ri@@ j ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , was then in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately had to be satisfied with Ble@@ ach .

according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ ve@@ y@@ USA from June 26th , Tru@@ mp and his bankrupt@@ cy was rejected by the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton .
other institutes see Tru@@ mp in the front , but not by far the distance that can apply to the federal state for Republi@@ can candidates .
as endangered also Arizona and Georgia are considered to be endangered .
in an interview with the CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp answered the question of how he wants to stop taking the march of Clin@@ tons : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and whether behind , this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either succeed , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is doing nothing else than to tell the truth . &quot;
if for him in the end , for reasons of the political correctness , no rich , be ok , Tru@@ mp said .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to Press reports , the Tru@@ mp &apos;s party shall have v@@ owed to cut funds to support his election campaign , should he be able to present no better conversion values .

&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ eni@@ as Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tes is threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a post@@ pon@@ able trial in a D@@ oping Control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a coach to home .
the International Olympic Committee dealt with , immediately to establish a discipl@@ in@@ ist commission to investigate the case .

that was reported to the team leadership of Ken@@ y@@ as from the dop@@ ing Contro@@ llers .
the World Association IA@@ AF has created the IO@@ C for information on the case in order to rigor@@ ous design , distributed an IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; depending on the results of the study and the following steps of IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an evaluation , &quot; it says in an IA@@ AF explanation .
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the D@@ oping down station and has been issued as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch , and signed the rehearsal , &quot; explained Kenya &apos;s leader de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p SO@@ I .

in the announcement of the IO@@ C indicated by the IO@@ C more than 2000 dop@@ ing destinations in front of the Rio Olympics , it was unfortunately advised to be noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia will be scre@@ ened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the world @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had put a lot of pressure on African countries to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a working control system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympia start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the wake of the W@@ ada Kenya , Kenya took from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing combat form with the rules of W@@ ada . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Russian ly@@ ch@@ ta@@ le@@ tes were then excluded from the summer games .

in orchest@@ ral mo@@ at the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ elan conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and tune .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have am@@ ber music really in our blood !
Bart@@ oli is playing a older company in this staging .
she re@@ members with melanch@@ oly to her love with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
first of all , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there &apos;s still Mary &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
so it is wise , naturally also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; she resembles that very much my Italian character , which I used as a Roman , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of Lob@@ es for the Opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour to work with her .
it is an enormous generous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and passionate ! &quot;
rigi@@ dity is for him a necessity .
you see it in each of its movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !

today , we took the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ er@@ t@@ ori@@ ans had gone to New York and the New York inhabitants did not want to .
they are the same themes and they are just as expres@@ sive as at that time .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who does not fit and Erdogan naturally sits on packed caffeine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the revol@@ ving of the hall@@ ess Foundation dialogue and world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kurdish community of Germany expects a short term of thousands of people to flee from Turkey to Germany in short notice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hundreds of thousands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Chief Executive Officer Ali top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the tough court of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tayyip Erdogan , after the coup , the Kurdish community is expecting a mass rally to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with ten thousand @-@ thousand deaths from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdogan regime fights the minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Chief Executive Officer Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government already went over months ago in short @-@ steps with criminal actions , the 500@@ ,000 Kurds in Turkey were on the run .
after the failed coup , put@@ sch and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks was added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to start anew in Europe if they are further sup@@ pressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state , which is raising refugees , produced in their own country refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Association of Association accused the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
with this Erdogan Erdogan is called to increase the exhau@@ sting pressure on the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradic@@ ated or displaced in the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , which is also CD@@ U .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the president called for the German government to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharp@@ ly as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also in Germany a &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; was held against Erdogan &apos;s critics .
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the past few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len @-@ Movement also fears the flight of many Turks .
more Turks are still searching asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition .
the fires as hall@@ mark supporters destro@@ ys doctors and other academ@@ ics that work professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who does not fit and Erdogan is sitting on gri@@ lled caffeine , by the way also the K@@ em@@ alists and se@@ cul@@ ar@@ ists , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un , Chairman of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gü@@ len @-@ related Foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and education , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the newspaper reported by calling on figures of the Federal Ministry of Defence , the Turks was already faced with the coup in front of the coup , the largest group of refugees justified for political persecution in Germany .
on 30 June , this is 11.@@ 386 people and therefore nearly 29 per cent of all known as asylum entitled ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , not the pre @-@ war , poverty or fu@@ tility was unnecessary .
asylum entitled to the Basic Law is political , therefore by state side , individually persecuted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to go where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals do not get anything from the summer @-@ election campaign with - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from Nord@@ rhein @-@ Westfalen must not choose the country &apos;s day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2021 will not be held again right at the end of the summer holidays , the European Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for bl@@ less than so far it is not about : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ tag@@ onal struggle - that bites .
the locals who are to be convinced of the fighters are on vacation .
most of the holiday makers in the country are on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not a native people , so do not choose the country &apos;s day .
these are practical problems : during the holidays , hel@@ pers , the posters are hanging , flas@@ hing , fl@@ yers , spread and count on the end of the cast , only dar@@ ing to be ex@@ hal@@ ted .
until the 4th of September 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to rise once again , just under the people , over the people .
the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his office .
the SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys .
exciting is how strong newcom@@ er Af@@ D is inter@@ sec@@ ting and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ tional dust .
cel@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 government leader is making an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign .
he travels through land , distributed ro@@ ses and chat@@ ting a little with the people , just as it did already his legendary @-@ like predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise , sailors has got his old feet and chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel bl@@ ends the guilt on the blos@@ som@@ ing of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We created this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I acceler@@ ates the rise of right @-@ wing popul@@ ists , which will probably cost him for the nice office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has seen as it is when you make the wrong time at the right place of choice .
she has invited her chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel on major show ; Merkel Bundestag , the Federal Republic of Germany lies in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not work , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphal@@ ia , Berlin and Sax@@ onia as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compl@@ ained Vincent Ko@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently at N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is a shame not to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , the northeast CD@@ U is largely disp@@ ens@@ ed to the usual election stands on market places and in front of shopping @-@ umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that co@@ operates , play only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minor role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Union also noted that you un@@ le@@ ashed the base in the country that it has to be very strict , again a wire to the people again .
it is about the left , the SPD , the Green : in the vast@@ ness of the country barely exists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U elections to co @-@ chief is also selfish : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they need to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : Dor@@ sey , Golden We@@ ddings , and any birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called its SPD to become an especially committed electoral campaign .
in surveys the Socialists and Democrats last last with 22 percent behind Partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just shortly before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the 2011 election , the SPD won the SPD clearly with 3@@ 5,@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Green Party , small party with seven percent in the surveys , should make the leap into the land@@ day .
they make a modern virtue out of the holidays , and put their election @-@ fight large parts into the internet .
&quot; online @-@ Elec@@ tions &quot; calls it the Landes@@ bank Claudia Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , green electoral fighters on sp@@ ur@@ ers embark on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; search for native voice among the tourists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the spit@@ zen@@ kan@@ atin , cur@@ v@@ t just with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ cl@@ en@@ bur@@ o lakes and finds it also beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : pub suffer from lock@@ out
at the speed , with which the B 27 is sanc@@ tioned , there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible for construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 am and only at 8 pm , there are all @-@ containing praise .
&quot; these have done everything pretty sti@@ cking , &quot; tells El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet gas station .
this is a super@@ team .
there is no de@@ duction .
the job@@ site could be reloc@@ ated to the south on the weekly basis as scheduled after the end of October , until the end of October everything should be ready .
also the opposing of construction is also praised for the construction work , e.g. when it comes to setting up accommodation cru@@ ises .
since the construction site on Monday emig@@ rated to the South and also the block@@ age of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen has been lifted , and thus also the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is rebuilt , the traffic situation in the place has eas@@ ed .
the citizens can now drive from O@@ f@@ ter@@ chel@@ in@@ ki from the B 27 again .
the alternative transport through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were partly significant complaints , &quot; says the deputy managing director Florian King for the traffic @-@ technical management of re@@ vis@@ as director Florian King .
the inhabitants of Bach @-@ Way , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many cre@@ eping ways were seeking to famili@@ arize themselves and more their Nav@@ i familiar than the sign@@ age .
what led to man@@ ent trucks in residential areas fran@@ che .
as the speed bump@@ s were not followed , the municipality increased the measur@@ er from m@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; there were considerable abundance , &quot; says King , who made himself the situation on the spot .
there were already two to three per minute in lit@@ ters .
the fastest way was about 77 km per hour in the pace @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
since the construction site has been moved , it is qui@@ eter now .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers of Rot@@ ten@@ burg the street is open again .
people don &apos;t like to look into the maps .
but that the B @-@ 27 restau@@ ration has led to them to sales revenue , everyone that is asked to look through .
however , some more and some are less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who has nothing to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; for other companies , for which it has hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also with the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er speaks Thomas Sul@@ z from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maximum slight drop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also one that is of course mis@@ guided &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most fur@@ b@@ ished are the restaurants along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
this is already existence @-@ threatening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not just him , but all their hosts have made it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard hit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it l@@ acked the customers of He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we need to be happy about each Euro area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the turnover tax is at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the street marking had its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two years back &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was able to release half of his associates .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dis@@ missed , politics would have responded differently .
instead , government Jörg Schmidt called on a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be financial compensation , with the indication of the location of the location at the B 27 . now , it also needs the disadvantages , which arise by the re@@ development .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other coun@@ ties where we have treated as gr@@ aci@@ ously .
with all chains , G@@ öh@@ ner thinks that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , the family farm has been setting here since 17@@ 15 , it points to the long history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other regul@@ ars are now less common because of complicated public transport , he can understand . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you can not drive , it is also elsewhere .
that his st@@ agn@@ ant returned again after the end of the restoration work , it has no doubt that G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt about it .
despite the crises with BS@@ E and bird gri@@ pping , G@@ öh@@ ner thinks the impact of the B 27 @-@ works on his cli@@ ent@@ ele for the largest crisis that has experienced its hospitality in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction , which is already brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constantly being rob@@ bed in the name of the terrorist fight against laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now lays on a thick security package .
but what has a dem@@ nity status to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ zer for all of this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives reconciliation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically viable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Interior Minister to the launch of his new safety package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you do not want anyone .
other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
also for this I took part .
but as Interior Minister , however , he was close to him and on a &quot; retreat consensus &quot; within the Coalition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère spent a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before it presents its conclusions for the safety of the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they are all the more extensive .
some have already been known , announced , announced that a new safety agency should take care of the b@@ aking coded communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU regulations on air@@ passenger data and weapon law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is not surprising .
in part de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , a second attempt on proposals that ended with the SPD : he wants to place sympath@@ ies for terrorist groups and ended jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still considered this to be reasonable and I also call for anything that I have no chance with the co@@ ali@@ zer .
a few new ideas are presented by Mai@@ zi@@ ère as well .
they are partly in himself : he plans to give fast @-@ moving processes for de@@ port@@ ations and more opportunities for de@@ tain@@ ement of people before the deportation .
refugees who are targeted specifically to the country are to put on their smartphone in their smartphone and disclose social media account for a security examination .
with D@@ ul@@ ings for exp@@ elled asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than before - about such crimes , the crimes commit or reject their papers to conce@@ de their identity .
some of these is political and legal .
man@@ ches also works un@@ exploited and leaves questions open .
and for a number of points - in the unequal treatment of opponents - the question arises : what does this have to do with certainty and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be written in Ab@@ speech that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg refugees were .
in addition , many people in the face of the high refugees are concerned about safety .
and things that most people employed people , now they could not cling in election periods as well .
internal security is enormous in the focus .
first the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are electoral campaigns .
Union and SD@@ P are therefore increasingly able to stand up in position with the topic of internal safety .
in the last few days between the two parties there went high .
only a gar@@ rison dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons @-@ Minister , where the intelligent@@ sia should also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a stop of the double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère was also here to irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able tones .
from a shift from the double pass , he gets nothing .
we have committed the discussion to Germany .
you are going to do something , be not useful .
and at a bur@@ ka ban he gave constitutional concerns .
whether his own pack is un@@ fixed at all corners and whether it is &quot; reasonable &quot; for co@@ ali@@ zations still has to be seen .
there &apos;s a lot of things that could provide for dispute .
but the SPD is currently trying to establish itself on the topic of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel was just sign@@ aled to talk and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to security further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet there is an agreement for Volkswagen .
despite diesel lines , the ex@@ tradition must increase worldwide .
but it is not going on in all markets .
with the recall campaign , there is vor@@ tex to a term .
Volkswagen is launching its maintenance in the second half @-@ year .
Europe &apos;s biggest car@@ makers can be able to continue in the course of the year , despite the diesel @-@ producers due to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July the key brand was weaker especially in Western Europe and dist@@ res@@ sed it again the total sale as it was listed in D@@ ax .
in July , the VW is sold all over the world in July of 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 per cent below the prior @-@ year figure .
in the home market , Germany do@@ d@@ ates the output to almost a sixth of the sixth .
Trade@@ marks President Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann stressed the weaker figures from July above all on two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , it has given back a department back to some core markets due to &quot; changed economic conditions . &quot;
along with the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote also imp@@ acted the vote from the EU , explained a spokes@@ person .
in the USA , where the Ab@@ gas@@ p first escal@@ ated initially , there is also a minus for be@@ ech .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the mainly affected person in Nieder@@ sachsen is already further pl@@ ain@@ ly ruled by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months only an ex@@ tradition minus of 0.@@ 9 percent is reached to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles .
group leader Fred Kap@@ pler obtained a sales spl@@ itting from January to July .
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million in this time .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software host test .
in Germany alone , VW is calling for approximately 2.5 million car re@@ armament to the workshops .
in the course of re@@ armament reiter@@ ated VW , that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects .
after re@@ armament of the vehicles there are no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or motor @-@ performance .
the car@@ bure@@ au to the customer after re@@ armament is a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but I am not talking about a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in the company .
the reason for the legal intri@@ c@@ acies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen gives its German customers a guarantee of circum@@ vent diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we would have confirmed this last Monday Even@@ ing representative in the State Department .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully defined the limits of my investigation commission and the full of KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; der@@ og@@ ations of this are not accepted , &quot; stated Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry .
VW has assumed the guarantee that in case of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motorcycle output after re@@ armament are no deterior@@ ations and all type @-@ related vehicle values remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was in corporate travel .
with the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers come to a workshop for example a half year after conver@@ tible into a workshop - and this could lead to the new software , even though the damage has nothing to do with it .
even in the customer &apos;s interest , it is important to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the ab@@ g@@ ass@@ essor for any failure of possible guarantees , as it was called .
therefore , VW is not using the term &quot; guarantee &quot; not .
the Rai@@ ffe@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands of rich austerity demands - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chief of Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is just about 139 customers , the 40 million euros to park in the bank of the bank accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bundes@@ verband der German banks speaks about an individual case and does not see it as a signal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savings would have to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not fear to pay for their austerity sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
warehouse banks money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay about 0.@@ 4 percent pen@@ alties .
this charge requires the Rai@@ ffe@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 euros on land or day cash accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 costs will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has been lifted up 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to the others and could not be able to see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are at me in the central bank account and cause a 0.3 percent cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the banker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lie down for every one million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after this , the costs shall be carried forward by the poll@@ uter @-@ seller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cash simply put in the Tres@@ ors of the Rai@@ ffe@@ isen@@ bank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be much too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank status . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers would have understanding and have changed to other spheres of investment .
only a few emig@@ rated to other banks .
the Gen@@ os@@ cop@@ s@@ verband Bayern explained : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes considerable costs at all banks . &quot;
you are to bear alone whether &quot; commercially viable is not possible . &quot;
some German banks therefore have raised their fees for account , credit cards or credit transfers .
with Pen@@ se@@ pul@@ ses for deposits made of three million euros the Thur@@ in@@ gian folk and Rai@@ ffe@@ isen@@ bank Alten@@ burger country had made headlines with their skat@@ ebo@@ ards stores in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , chief executive officer of the banking union commented : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private clients to pay region@@ wide coverage for deposits , the competition in Germany is much too strong for banks and savings banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ kers said , on Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cliff , which is somewhat hol@@ y@@ ingly equipped by the property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bench if they free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 1911 ... founded Gen@@ os@@ cop@@ s@@ bank G@@ mund has doubts in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ at , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
in the region known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the con@@ os@@ ci@@ ence of Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is currently no more banks known to calculate a compensation for deposits of private clients , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said speaker Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president of the Bundes@@ verband der German People &apos;s banks and Rai@@ ffe@@ isen@@ banks ( B@@ v@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared on the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go to Neg@@ ative , is very , very high . &quot;
the competition was tough , and it thre@@ aten the emig@@ ration of investors to the competition .
the customers in Germany will not be able to please this in the width .
destination plates : who does buy record @-@ plates ?
emp@@ t@@ ful men of middle age love plates .
before you join the commentary box , to l@@ itter it under the alias non @-@ single men &apos;s lo@@ osing age with rough ins@@ ults , this statement deri@@ ves from actual data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the diverse voc@@ alist of vin@@ yl records does not want to have a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to greet the news of physical objects but to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who have recently purchased a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyers .
it is also not a horror by Hob@@ by@@ collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older records reserve their feelings far for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but agree the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a news clip in television , I would follow the camera , while I walk in a busy road in Soho , a modest gray dress and wild cont@@ ented before I ste@@ al , my hands and something determining how : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even if the heart of So@@ ya slowly gains its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now fill the buildings where once independent sal@@ es@@ men were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn the camera to the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to evaluate their age and mind through observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , which I received from S@@ ister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle ages ) into the Rec@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle age , a woman , probably about 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and walks through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I already appreciate , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
these sound@@ boards , shown above ( he sent me the snapshot by E @-@ Mail , I have not followed it at home ) , dress the walls of his room .
the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records which he could not afford to buy and re @-@ buy objects he sold , when he was young and ple@@ ite .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60@@ ies , early 7@@ 0s which appeared as I was 11 or 12 . things when I was probably too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I drink not very much .
this is my L@@ aster .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works in S@@ ister Ray , believes also that many customers that he meets to apply for the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
it also has noticed a new wave of people who will be influenced by the Medi@@ ter@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and put on to buy their old records again .
with the conversations I have led , people usually have been dra@@ ined around 1998 or 1999 in their collection .
customers that were once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to get back their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom in the tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica , to realize that record stores a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z some of the older customers were killed on the non @-@ contact payment system .
some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw themselves to the stability of familiar sound pl@@ atten@@ ing envel@@ opes , of items , the happy Yu@@ gen@@ der@@ ings .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or possession of material possessions than being a kind of comfort , &quot; says NE@@ Z .
that is with me as a collectors , and I think it is like many people .
it is a simple way to relate to spiritually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fl@@ are a staff from a record stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April uncovered that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month they have not heard yet .
the survey was also found that 41 % possess a turn@@ table which they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , no turn@@ tables have .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look very concerned while being pet@@ ri@@ fied by st@@ acks of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , of the sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three men middle age ) has been working , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of Re@@ vi@@ vals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone recently came here purely and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not own a turn@@ table , but I would like to buy a radio top record , so I can put them to the shelf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a great percentage but it definitely happens .
more product @-@ las@@ hing , less music cl@@ as@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no turn@@ table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones who are only slowly coming .
F@@ lop , which devoted the record plates to almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience , when I go away .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ ager and women aged .
even though the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts new@@ ester syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ i@@ gri@@ lled Pop instead of experimental jazz , pulling from the speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among the customers .
none of them looks lonely , but wet mental trau@@ mas are hard to determine if you stand next to someone 30 seconds long .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for a couple of minutes and considers the variations of the panels for sale .
it rather makes a window @-@ roll than a big purchase .
it does not deserve much , so the collection of plates is not a real option , says it .
it will cost a lot .
it is easy to hear music from one computer or in another way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she drives with a loved si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is truly unique .
my last stop is a shop that is said to have inspired a new generation of style lovers : urban out@@ fit@@ ters .
as I give the semb@@ lance of mu@@ g the je@@ ans hot@@ ter , I &apos;ve group@@ ed a group of young teenage girls , who group for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter remember to buy a cros@@ ley turn@@ table .
on the left there is a stair@@ well , a wall full of records from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential records for an average collection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one looks like it - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it &apos;s impossible to put it up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that each attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of so@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it &apos;s no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , also the one that is closest to luxury items as drives .
even if my research were revealed that the results from You@@ Go@@ v de@@ votes , at least in record business in Soho , the huge number of female collectors , who exist in reality , record business and in online for@@ es .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday tomorrow with safety not with stro@@ lling through records of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaf through plates , while they en@@ vy the star@@ ving view of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old moder@@ ator that prot@@ ru@@ des over the shoulders of the middle aged .

French court claims the offer of demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court ordered an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live .
in case of court hearing this week argued the authorities in Cal@@ ais that the state should be authorized to sell 72 provisional shops in which people within the storage of goods , from cigarettes to duck drinks , sell , hair@@ dressing services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 P@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros sold in provisional restaurants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cal@@ ais Pre@@ fecture argue that these places should be torn down because they would pose a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid and which a fire and san@@ ity risk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
humanitarian groups divided the court with the fact that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state supported association and other groups will not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
she also led out that the detention shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for expulsion of people who run 72 provisional shops , but adm@@ its that the concerns raised by Cal@@ ais &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was absolutely comprehensible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François Mol@@ la said that food shops , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just people who live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas will provide quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the fall was the young Book of kids &apos; café , which is well maintained and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0@@ ,000 people signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two auxiliary organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimates on Friday that the number of people in the jungle has increased over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number up now - after a steep asc@@ ended increase in new arri@@ vals during the summer .
despite Olympics disappointment : Martin will remain comb@@ at@@ ant

he does not have an explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af ( P@@ lo@@ af ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honestly say it hard to comment the time of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyse in peace and analyze the reasons for the deb@@ acle .
Martin actually wanted to fight for the title at the time of the October World Championship in Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will see everything that we have changed in the last days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s Ras@@ he must set to adjust to the next generation of speed sets : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices will be tested , which are to be predominantly handed over to the tem@@ p .
the futur@@ istic eff@@ lu@@ ent En@@ forcement of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden , for example , can be used for an accident dispute , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway construction sites or to sandy bridges , with a temporary garage , there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide there with a stationary car@@ vers for the spe@@ edy limiting .
a lasting mobile construction can however be too dangerous or time @-@ consuming .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : his battery holds five days , the case data is encrypted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can be recorded across multiple tracks at the same time .
variable speed bump@@ s , as well as transit b@@ ans , by time , lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the highly experienced condition it is possible to move the pend@@ ant according to manufacturer with every car , with a cl@@ utch .

furthermore , a built @-@ in alarm system should be protected by the cameras in front of v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to V@@ ronic data in various federal states and is now also used .

UK gets Silver in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by , after Master Class Gold is taking
the impressive performance of Britain at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came to a ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were defeated by a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the defensive stage here in Rio .
Fiji granted a master class in handling , side @-@ Step@@ ping , p@@ itting , line @-@ up and crude force to gain gold - its first Olympi@@ ad of any color .
the defeat was won by the not too bad tro@@ phy of the silver medal - Great Britain in this day - and they were certainly proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they proposed New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the ram , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could be dropped off in the final .
but irrespective of this , Fiji on this form could have taken a 15 @-@ man team in order .
it could be a comfort for UK - but will it probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal to hang his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Chef@@ trainer Ben Ryan , the former head for England in Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult path behind them .
eight years ago it was lost among Ryan of every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this sli@@ des@@ is going to we@@ ep , but the progress is amazing .
Fiji began to be released and caused the attacks to GB@@ s out of fun .
it felt like captain Tom Mitchell and Co. in the running running . the World Series players went out 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au went in the corner .
with just four minutes of playing time Jerry Tu@@ wai yet another attack from the right corner , which he changed .
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely captured the ball .
a he@@ vor@@ ingly tone of Mitchell put the mountain from Sierra Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but Fiji just stopped .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a will be a touch @-@ down in the right corner and there was 0 @-@ 17 for the UK .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa has added a new since the re@@ fi@@ ff and it still has a minute of playing ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ide through further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med down to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while the UK is still over .
this is how it is .
GB triggered basic changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ lian gap ... for all four minutes , what was good for the circumstances of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova res@@ ran into a brilliant lu@@ c@@ play of Fiji .
Dan Nor@@ ton launched a try for the UK , made a Touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran for a long time in favor of the southern sights , whose fans s@@ essed , flags sm@@ iled and danced on the ble@@ ach@@ ers .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ zer put the i @-@ icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
the P@@ fi@@ ff prot@@ ru@@ te , the fi@@ j@@ is embr@@ aced and GB @-@ pl@@ ated ni@@ ckel @-@ pl@@ ated in the lawn .
earlier in the day Fiji Japan had defeated Japan in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain squee@@ zed South Africa in a scarce semi@@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain conversion to the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the boat in the first half to front , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke down the line with an impressive leg@@ work and scored a gate among the post in the second half .
a brilliant late @-@ winner of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ seaside team , secured the prize - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the trainer for rowing machines
there will be no em@@ ot@@ in@@ aler@@ es gold than with these games and that is what hot .
from the first stroke until the last , 220 hard hits , which go into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an extra meaning in its golden moment at the Est@@ acio since Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only the two of those who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the Echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present when she turned the first women in the history of British Sports , who laid on such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolute , at least their 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ varnis@@ hed bet , which is also unparalleled .
what we are seeing are two brilliant athlete who gli@@ des over the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ge , which does not reflect the nature of the Tri@@ om@@ phe , which is not reflected .
behind every gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on to wil@@ ly hel@@ pers who make the difference and it was not an assistant director than the coach , who did not survive the day 30 months ago , if he was diagnosed with him cancer .
as he said he was risky .
I had bladder cancer who is oper@@ able and they did so .
if you do not , he spreads throughout .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio had luck that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , could start out what the interruption occurred to a minimum , in case those under such circumstances is the correct term .
I needed money , so I had to get it better soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet , 30 foot , 50 feet to a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it starts .
rowing in itself is a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the in@@ medi@@ ating of victory , her first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a very beginning morning a little more than usual and tried to process his own fears .
p@@ anning , which was as Haupt@@ mann in the Royal Ar@@ ll@@ ery regim@@ ent in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional Wr@@ ack . that &apos;s maybe something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
it repeatedly stim@@ ulates how much I have worked , how much I and Helen and also the Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , therefore a massive thanks to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have a better person for exercising or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race in the last five years .
the pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponents were not able to keep up with .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very trapped at the moment .
Helen called &quot; stay in the process , ab@@ iding in the process . &quot;
it is really important to not let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to make some Tol@@ les .
we did not want a fire@@ works today , we simply wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
the couple will take a break for one year before it will make decisions about its future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer in Steve Back@@ .
now she just want to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want that I was my last race .
this could have too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to understand that I am a Olympi@@ ad .
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
it feels so much better , &quot; she said .
31 years exemplary for clarity
the CEO of the ex@@ pedi@@ ment &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ i group , &quot; R@@ up@@ pert G@@ öller , goes to retirement .
the association is regarded as &quot; Bav@@ arian &quot; ( Bavaria ) .
a small fresh water of water ex@@ pedi@@ ti@@ zed as a model for the big water producers .
so it was some time ago in the original part of the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
somewhat later the Aqu@@ forum of the government of Lower fran@@ king paid the second @-@ association .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ formation @-@ group is &quot; b@@ av@@ ed &quot; as pic@@ tured . &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the two @-@ party member state who was 28 years as managing director .
now , at the age of 65 he was retirement in retirement .
the drinking water purpose of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ a group with its headquarters in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality G@@ brunn , generates around 150@@ 000 cu@@ bic meters of water annually and supplies 32 locations and complexes with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; member states are the communities of Kirch@@ berg , Broad@@ brunn , lou@@ der , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ tah . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are water suppliers for further towns and villages .
the current president , the Breit@@ ling Civil Society of Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller 1985 was appointed as water@@ keeper and was appointed Managing Director of the Second association .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they aim to work on office and maintenance activities , bud@@ get@@ ary production , calculation of fees and contributions to emergen@@ cies in weekends , &quot; said the Chair .
as outstanding events , she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , ground@@ work purchases in the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the refurb@@ ishment of high containers ( 1999 ) , re @-@ creation of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the divisions of water pipes .
there have been no dead@@ lock and one repeated@@ ely picked up new additions , because water life supplies and pot@@ able water the most important food .
in her Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o she praised El@@ li@@ &apos;s faithful , reliable and accurate service for over 31 years .
he has worked with a lot of passion for his water purpose , and he lived in properly the water @-@ purpose association , as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , he was allowed to present the success story of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ tal group at the Frankfurt @-@ forum of the Lower Tri@@ Francis@@ can district .
that is why he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , on the one hand , praised Al@@ f@@ ons Grie@@ bel , who worked for 28 years with him .
he is the best water @-@ s@@ keeper and he was a faithful leg .
together we were an unbeatable team .
as a highlights from his point of view he described the fountain and the restructuring of the two @-@ branch .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult work , however , the tube @-@ quarry at the high reservoir at Kirch@@ berg were lou@@ der on January 3rd .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so the loc@@ alities could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn at once again can only be maintained , because one filled the high containers of p@@ ett@@ stadt with bottles .
the management of drinking water purpose was given to Daniel storms from lou@@ der , who enters the successor of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called himself by us and stated his partner to be shot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a poli@@ ze@@ al prec@@ ept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator may be on the flight , after him there is being made public .
meanwhile nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters tall , muscular , brown , burned and has a g@@ ossi@@ p .
meanwhile the police released a photo of him .
it is a couple of years old .
meanwhile the man has a g@@ ossi@@ p .
the man is not to be addressed directly .
he could still bear the weapon with them , so the police .
who sees Sven S. , is going to call the 110 .
the police are speaking of a &quot; relationship community . &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator 1981 .
in Lü@@ beck , the responsible police in Lü@@ beck initially wanted to make no information about the Ta@@ ther@@ ing or the relationship between perpetr@@ ator and the victims ; but she confirmed that a man had been killed .
&quot; it is a killing . &quot;

steel - Licht@@ blick hut for Deutsche St@@ ah@@ lindustrie
the crisis @-@ exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in a million @-@ height region .
financial stresses that thre@@ aten the industry from the eco @-@ generation , are off the table .
it remains in the liberation from the renewable energy conversion ratio to the so @-@ called self @-@ stream production in the German steel industry , said East German Minister , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday issue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we finally could finally reach negotiations after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission was therefore initially planned to use the steel producer , the gases from the Ho@@ cho@@ p for electricity generation for its own consumption , to the cas@@ hier .
the steel industry generated an additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year according to the German industry sectors .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , I now admit a basic certificate of the European Commission for talks with the Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators used in the steel bodies will be replaced , all an E@@ EG lev@@ y system from 20 percent .
but even this is not raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the European Commission on the energy supply .
this will be largely written the status quo before the regulation .
special importance is the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is this a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more need to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even during the reform of the E@@ mission ri@@ eh@@ and@@ ular &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; climate and employment targets are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meeting &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stated IG Metall facilit@@ ator , Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel industry in Europe has been suffering in excess capacity and a significant price pressure from the financial crisis in 2008 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last year , the situation was further intensi@@ fying to be the world &apos;s largest producer of China in light of the weak@@ ening domestic demand for growth stag@@ gering steel on the world market .
European manufacturers raise Chinese steel @-@ resistant pricing dumping .
in the course of this spring the situation has relaxed .
on the one hand , suspension of import and import @-@ carbon impact , on the other hand , the economic prospects have been stra@@ ined in China .
unclear is how sustainable the price @-@ up is .
the German industry priest Thys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p remained war@@ med on Thursday .
finally , the prices would be more st@@ agn@@ ant again .
the branch re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p did not want to exclude the closing of individual works . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the German steel industry , at the end of 2015 , some 8@@ 6000 people were occupied .
in July the German steel producer remains careful despite increasing prices and increasing orders .
they produced up to 3.4 million tons of less than six percent less crude steel than in the prior @-@ year period , such as the economic association &apos;s steel on Friday .
after a short increase in May the set quantity went back in the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production is about two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months the association is counting on an improved delivery event , with an increasing number of output .
community , spirit , health : singing is good
the singing has accompanied UR@@ SE@@ L Ki@@ pp for her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school@@ choir , in the mag@@ ister@@ ium , she occupied the com@@ partment , and now the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a seniors choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sing myself - emo@@ tionally and physically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; describes it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a rehearsal , it feels well @-@ balanced , cheerful and overall lively , she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very far , they are doing something good with their health and spirit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because singing is a great hobby for seniors right from a number of perspectives , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German Re@@ ti@@ en@@ liga .
most seniors sing in chorus and share with like @-@ minded people in music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by regular meeting , Sen@@ iors wants to link and maintain social contacts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because often social and family structures play in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience also has made UR@@ SE@@ L Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaking and organize themselves on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of awareness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for doing so exercise sen@@ i@@ ores the deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demand his lungs are not as fast as the one in everyday life .
even when it comes to obtaining the sound of the voice in the age , sing is an optimal hobby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older people often have a very special effect , &quot; Ursula L@@ enz says of the German labour community of the senior citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the older generations the common sco@@ ingen had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure time .
L@@ enz frequently ob@@ serves that the singing or hearing of songs in elderly people aw@@ akes many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their adol@@ escent years .
through lyrics and particularly melodies dis@@ ables themselves in vain people of long rec@@ tan@@ eous events .
in the case of singing a special service will also be demanded , explains L@@ enz .
focusing at the same time on their own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge .
just elderly people who live alone , exercise not just concentrate on oneself .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through the singing in the chorus , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
even the self @-@ esteem is growing by the singing in the choir .
to show yourself : if I stop for something for a long time , I become better and more vigil@@ ant about me - this experience rein@@ forces .
good reasons to start with the singing , there is enough .
who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he says , do not have little talent , betra@@ y L@@ enz .
you do not sing alone - at 50 sin@@ ful people , who listen , if a sound goes wrong ?
on the search for the suitable offer , seniors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
sing someone from the familiar circle in a seniors , you can just conc@@ ur .
many cities also offer views of choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ astic chorus can address the church or the Church .
a lot of people of people can also be found via the Internet .
anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbours to help with the internet service .
who would like to sing , should join in a choir , betra@@ y H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing is good doing the soul and has something fre@@ eing - that is true for any age .
cats respond sensitive to a han@@ go@@ ver in the cri@@ es of the young animals
bi@@ ologists have examined in Hanover , which effect the cri@@ es from cat@@ bab@@ ys has on adult animals .
to her surprise , the ch@@ ew was not cold even the male - however , in contrast to the females always remained the same .
female cats can recognize the endurance of cat@@ bab@@ ys in the mixing of the babies .
they react to ten percent faster to Lau@@ te of kittens that are in great distress , as scientists have found out of the veterinary University and the Medizin@@ ische Hochschule Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
as a result , cr@@ ater also respond to the sum@@ mons of kittens - but always the same .
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the ch@@ ew of less and strongly aroused p@@ ups for the males either not percep@@ tible or not of significance , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is first authorized in the study that was published on this Friday at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evolution@@ ary Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kittens cry is different with the urgency of their help .
a total of nine adult k@@ aters and eight que@@ ens were seen from the animal keeping of the MH@@ H .
they were pre @-@ played for a jer@@ king of little ones who were taken out of the throw @-@ box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ blings .
to the other they were confronted with scre@@ ams of stronger ties who were additionally lifted up .
the researchers keep their findings despite the low sample test for meaningful fun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females , even those who had not yet got their own offspring , re@@ acted upon the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned up faster to the loud@@ speaker , if this jer@@ king played the very rainy kittens .
this ability may possibly be innate or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have ever re@@ acted , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in .
in the past , scientists have already studied several of the reactions from women and men on baby @-@ noise .
in fact , some studies showed that women were sensitive to infants , no matter whether they were previously available mothers or not , the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ lon@@ r is a football @-@ legend in Turkey .
Turkey has addressed an arrest warran@@ t in Turkey against the past foot@@ ball@@ star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ad@@ r .
he &apos;s accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
first after the coup , Turkey finds an important football match .
in front of the du@@ el of the Archbishop of Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as a &quot; is announced .
already in the suspension of the emergency , after the overthrow , the government , the everyday life of normal brus@@ h@@ ers should not be com@@ promised .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup .
it does not stop in front of football .
against the former Star@@ ki@@ cker Hak@@ an South , the prosecution issued an arrest warran@@ t .
according to this , the South Africa in America is now accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
South Tyrol should be tra@@ ilers of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is held accountable by President Rec@@ ep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup .
although it is valid for 90 days , suspension is still valid till October , in fact it has a good effect on the lives of the most Turks but almost no re@@ perc@@ ussions .
the ni@@ gh@@ tly &quot; democracy @-@ father@@ land &quot; in public places across the country Erdogan is declared on Wednesday for an end .
sport is - like all the country - split up into followers and opponents of the earth .
particularly fans of the workers &quot; club Po@@ kt@@ as do not traditionally present to the friends of the president .
but what the Gro@@ s of the Turks was confronted with the most dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coup .
and even the fans agree - no matter if their heart is beating heart for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Se@@ kt@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ cal@@ ender &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be particularly arriving by Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his sporty value presented the Köl@@ ner in the preceding season : with 17 gates and nine templates , in all competitions the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first season as a top scor@@ er of his association .
in the end game against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce , he posted the 1 : 0 wins .
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished in excellent way the season and secured the tro@@ phy for his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this disappointing season for the record team found an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the pre @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League of the &quot; Lion &quot; of the European league .
in the South , there was only one to rank six .
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed and this is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Lu@@ kt@@ as the game was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who presented with the 26 season of season as an Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ s@@ kö@@ nig , the base for the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
in doing so , the Gom@@ ez signed in Florence under contract and was announced to Se@@ kt@@ a Gom@@ ez only after the coup , because of the political situation in the country after its EM @-@ vacation did not return .
&quot; if Mario still wants to come to us , he has to say it , &quot; cited the magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; Club@@ bed Fi@@ cre@@ t Or@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but storms must be prepared to for@@ ego about a third of his $ 7.5 million Euro @-@ estimated millennium ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his salary at Florence we can not pay &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes still have medals @-@ chances at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Justin Gat@@ lin was locked already twice due to dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa may not start in Rio .
others survived Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics and can only laugh it - they fight in Rio to medals .
the topic D@@ oping determines how the headlines with the Olympic Games in Rio .
the Russian sho@@ ots in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who had compl@@ ained after a dop@@ ing lock lock her Star@@ seed shortly before playing , was pl@@ essly off and b@@ lown off at her start ( 100 meters chest ) .
it offered a sculpture scenario : with a separate smile she was still proud of the hall and prov@@ oked with her appearance .
it was to be certain that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a che@@ er .
but there are many more athletes , who , despite the dop@@ ing past at the Olympic Games in Rio to start off .
here is an overview :
Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in the athle@@ tics .
he was locked for two time on the dop@@ ing of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since his ban the Olympi@@ ad from 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion has been running even faster than before , it is above 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered to be the biggest challenge of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time olymp@@ ic and si@@ eben@@ me@@ World Championship in 2010 had to settle a six @-@ month lock , after you have proven the pain by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation I had strong tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended themselves .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympi@@ ad of 2012 , World Championship , was tested positive on the banned ab@@ ul@@ ant drug meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ amine in 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic re@@ joins the early release and was closed six months .
the four broad@@ est thro@@ ws this year go to the account of the great Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing @-@ Olympic @-@ ger and two @-@ time world @-@ master over 400 m , was tested in 2010 positive and 21 months have been blocked .
a means of penis enlargement may have been responsible , affir@@ med Mer@@ ritt .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the fastest growing man in the world .
I@@ wan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ sti@@ cky , Belarus ) : hardly any athlete have been recognized as many medals subsequently .
so , Ti@@ chy lost its world championship title from 2005 to nine years later , after having found testosterone dop@@ ing .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to also provide Olympics @-@ silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
this was also reflected in the Bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games in 2008 as a result of a ruling portion of the International Sport@@ geri@@ atic court CA@@ S .
with 80@@ ,@@ 04 m he is in rank two of the world rankings .
Li@@ u Hong Kong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world championship and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was tested in a positive way only in May but can still start in Rio .
at the 29 year old world championship in terms of the intake of a well @-@ bot@@ tled water supplement it was found , the sper@@ re of the world @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency W@@ ada dropped off and ran on 13th July .
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian death - Sever@@ e deaths
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is up with the woman in contact , told the priest of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Fre@@ edi@@ an early .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has f@@ aded and been dealt with in the hospital , but I have already left it back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she planned her return journey for the beginning of September .
whether from other explo@@ sions on the holiday@@ island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ ol@@ on , Austrian citizen are also still unclear .
the State Department present in constant contact with local authorities , so dum@@ my .
approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok @-@ Hua H@@ in , two bombs were on Thursday evening on Thursday evening .
according to the police , a Tha@@ il@@ in killed and some 20 people were killed , including the Austrian authorities , three Dutch , three Dutch and three Italians .
Friday morning then two war@@ ps went up again , according to the authorities a further human being killed .
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket was reported in the morning a bomb explosion was reported .
with the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular Bad@@ est@@ ran@@ ds Pat@@ ong was injured after police records a taxi driver is injured .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , a further bomb that killed a municipal staff .
the spr@@ int was placed according to the authorities in a flo@@ wer@@ bed before the prec@@ inct of the coastal police in the air .
finally , the det@@ on@@ ations demanded in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g in the south @-@ west coast , as well as the Ar@@ ch on the southeast coast several injured .
in connection with the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bom@@ ben@@ att@@ ar@@ ate carry the same manuscript , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army General Dan@@ ai Krit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Fri@@ an@@ early in front of journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that this is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express themselves to potential things - probably though it is the deeds of Muslim rebels .
the Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks that is typical for the bom@@ b@@ ur Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , did not oppose the attacks in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement or by international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is just local Sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , it is assumed that bombs have been shut down by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities in the past few days would have received secrecy about im@@ pending strikes in the south of the country - however , they were not informed about the exact time and place of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
still be unclear , which group behind the attacks .
police pointed to their officials all over the country , security around important government buildings as well as airports , railway stations , restaurants and leisure districts .
in Thailand there are always minor bom@@ b@@ ings , but they are mostly not directed against tourists .
in Hua H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years of Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the well @-@ hungry bomb attack , the Austrian Foreign Ministry is recommen@@ ding to act on his website to keep the instructions of the Thai safety authorities .
high safety risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ par@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ par@@ kl@@ a and its surroundings .
after disputes between security guards and Muslim populations , there is not any necessary travel to this province .
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday signed a few days after a controversial referendum on one of the military jun@@ ta &apos;s constitution .
this grants to the military big influence over the coming years .
Jun@@ ta chief , Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said the bombs would have been an attempt to sti@@ p@@ ens chaos , while the country move towards stability , an improvement of the economic situation and tourism .
the Military Un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody crimes , considers itself to be a good position to bring the kingdom to stability and order .
however , it has not succeeded in having the military to get a grip on in the ou@@ ter@@ most southern part of the country in the extreme south of the country .
over 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago in Bangkok the attack had been killed in a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine to 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack in the younger history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ anic movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is at the Visi@@ er of the Federal Ministry of Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to several provincial offices , the constitutional A@@ war@@ er in the federal government also placed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see at the &apos; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular movement &apos; approach to aspirations for the fundamental democratic basic rules , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Protection Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that way , the other Islamic faith or from the Middle East will diff@@ use in extrem@@ ist way .
therefore we observe the movement now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ anic movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is aimed at &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; Un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by means of alien@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional A@@ constitu@@ ents in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , N@@ RW , Nieder@@ sachsen , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - observe the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ tit@@ ular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ate said , his authority was closely aligned with the local offices .
&quot; groups such as the &apos; I@@ den@@ tit@@ anic movement &apos; try to clin@@ ch their target audience , where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional protection .
generally try extremis@@ ts , speak them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ iger music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the did Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extremis@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is not a proper advertising for one &apos;s own cause .
propaganda should address the people emotional .
young people are in a special way suscep@@ tible .
this is dangerous .
finally , from several federal states there had been reports of contacts of &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular &quot; towards Af@@ D @-@ politicians .
Ma@@ ate said , I did not have any insights .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species are only relevant to a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - through certain individuals , the extrem@@ ist are changing and so extrem@@ ist .
therefore , it is critical if such people have been controlling their influence over the party .
this is not recognizable .
with a view to the marked increase of un@@ lawful criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees drow@@ ned , he would not talk of new right terrorism in this regard .
but we have noticed in recent years that there can be legally antagon@@ istic structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the free group .
it may well be that further justi@@ fying group@@ ings or small groups form , the attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee or attacks from other far @-@ right moti@@ fs plan .
but a nationwide or pan @-@ European control of law@@ suit is not recognizable .
the previous groups were originated on the regional level or in social networks .
they expressed themselves Ma@@ d@@ ded that many attacks came to the account of people who had not appeared before in the right scene .
this is a worrying .
many of the susp@@ ects on asylum @-@ accommodations were not previously known as a crime , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; many people have committed crimes that were previously agreed with right @-@ wing extremis@@ ts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example the CD@@ U , SPD or left elected , but who have become radic@@ alised by far @-@ right mood . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always determine the Olympics or world records the headlines with the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center spon@@ ges the slightly overweight swi@@ mmer from Ethiopia so slowly that he was no longer able to see in the TV pictures again .
he disappeared simply - no matter how far the cut was cut .
in social networks Hab@@ its then became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a rep@@ lica of 48 seconds and took the 5@@ 9th position of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather not a sporty figure , which attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
Ethiop@@ ians had got a special impetus from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub@@ mar@@ inated countries more well known .
since in the Ethiopia most sports@@ men run , Hab@@ or simply wanted to do something different .
preparing is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ it is ready for the big race .
fast the first sh@@ re@@ names made the lap .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media drawn him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ bel of the whale &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; super @-@ style &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English Bou@@ lev@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was funny . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he struck only at a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter Fre@@ isti@@ l , played no part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; compare to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were also pulled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i carried attention to media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the Flo@@ ating from Equ@@ atorial Guinea , when he had to compete in one @-@ run over 100 metres away .
fren@@ e@@ tically was then fired at M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i .
the days 22 @-@ year @-@ old began to swim eight months before the Olympia hall and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Tru@@ mp regards the dro@@ ple@@ ting election size not so closely
the Republi@@ can presidential guard , Donald Tru@@ mp speaks at an election event in Florida .
should it be nothing with the choice to the US President , Donald Tru@@ mp has already been an alternative .
he then sk@@ ate to the holiday .
if Donald Tru@@ mp loses the US presidential election in November , would be the relative matter : &quot; in the end it will either hand or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the candidate of the Republi@@ can in a phone interview with the US TV broadcast@@ er CN@@ BC .
if for him in the end , for reasons of the political correctness , no rich , be ok , said Tru@@ mp .
thus he drew the President Barack Obama and the nomin@@ ee of Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , as founder of the terrorist militia , Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party there has been more and more resistance .

Mr. Hart@@ mann has been the Gf@@ K tip since 2011 .

accidents - bus sli@@ ces in cr@@ acks in dit@@ ch : eight wounded
&quot; &quot; &quot; when an accident involving a coach with 43 seniors as the passengers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guests are on Thursday in Kru@@ dru@@ d@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) eight people have been injured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the occup@@ ations suffered severe injury , divided the police with .
the 66 years old chassis of the bus company from Eisen@@ ach had to lay down its indications according to a vice @-@ driven li@@ vice , which was partly on the counter @-@ road .
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch as a spokes@@ person on the police Aur@@ I / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus self @-@ sufficient , &quot; she said .
the fire@@ brig@@ ade took the passengers .
six b@@ ail@@ out cars and an emergency situation came to the accident at the provincial road 2 .
the most recent travelers were brought back by a public bus to the Kar@@ pac@@ c@@ ner district P@@ ew@@ sum .
they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .

the fees per cu@@ bic metres of waste water are held from 1 October 2016 for the se@@ wage system Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ zen@@ berg 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 Euro , for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( up to 18 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( up to now 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the installation in Az@@ endorf , the wast@@ ew@@ ater fee will then be increased at the latest if appropriate improvement measures will be necessary .
after a over@@ lap calculation , the wast@@ ew@@ ater is then placed at 4.@@ 37 Euro per cu@@ bic meter .
as the mayor of Bernd stone houses ( CS@@ U ) reported , it was noted for the approval of the budget by the Kul@@ mb@@ ach council , that for these wast@@ ew@@ ater treatment systems .
the market Kas@@ endorf is required due to its legal basis to run the systems tot@@ alling .
as of 1 October 2016 , citizens as well as industrial and industrial companies from Bavaria , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , An@@ uth , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg have to reach deeper into the wal@@ let .
the ag@@ it@@ ator increased between 48 and 67 percent .
as the manager of Directors , Herbert Schmidt laid down the Panel , a new circulation of fees for se@@ wage systems of the market was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 also over@@ - respectively sub @-@ covers from the preceding drop period was identical .
the grace@@ ful nur@@ series was founded Schmidt thereby for@@ ge in all three se@@ wage systems with relatively small facilities with a very low se@@ wage fall , which lie between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 Ku@@ bi@@ k@@ meters per year .
thus , due to the small distribution grounds , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would have grave consequences .
moreover , the se@@ wage decrease in all three systems is slightly decl@@ ining .
furthermore , in the underlying cal@@ am@@ atory period during all three systems not least due to its age , breeding and repair expenses has been taken in a substantial extent .
the complex in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ zen@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years .
Schmidt re@@ confirmed that in the san@@ itation facility Az@@ endorf had to be exchanged due to a damage .
in the p@@ umping station , the nearly 20 year old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led due to the ground and in the pond area Lop@@ p , after nearly 20 years of operation the first small cri@@ pple had to be installed and an additional ventilation system was installed to meet the water @-@ related specifications also in future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the continued supervis@@ ors and maintenance costs were to be taken into account in accordance with the new &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Calendar period &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which rose significantly below the current level in the years 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made clear that with the small se@@ wage fall in the three systems the expendi@@ tures for the operation and maintenance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thereby , he added Schmidt , the market community of great entertainment facilities for se@@ wage systems over the past 20 years .
the situation for the above facilities will remain prec@@ arious about stone houses in the long run , especially as we can not expand the supply area of the wast@@ ew@@ ood of Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal for these systems because it is concerned with matters concerned .
Bulgaria beats up for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July 1 % were on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first on zero since October last year , when positive 0,@@ 2 % were fully booked .
the annual global stag@@ flation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured by the CP@@ I -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.@@ 0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was 0,@@ 2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 amoun@@ ted to 0,@@ 2 % .
in July 2016 , in comparison with the pre @-@ mon@@ at , the following groups of consumer goods were observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.6 % ) ; transport and culture ( 6,@@ 3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.2 % ) ;
the prices were in clothing and shoes ( 2,@@ 2 % ) ; Mo@@ bili@@ ar , household appliances and routine expectations ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
the prices remained as in the pre @-@ mon@@ at in alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; An effect as Asi@@ atic caricature
sn@@ ap@@ chat tells that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is uns@@ ensi@@ tizing towards races .
with its filtering tool , sn@@ ap@@ chat will allow about 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identities in such a way that borders the Ab@@ sur@@ de .
you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure , which could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are non @-@ bloo@@ ded , independent tools , which more than 30 million improved sel@@ fish@@ ers per day .
all mis@@ steps will be taken to the public .
sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have drawn in the past critic@@ isms that they have been accused of using the app Black@@ face skir@@ ting or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when a few users proposed a filter to some users , who gave them sle@@ w , false teeth and d@@ un@@ ted che@@ eks , some critics were a rac@@ ist caricature of A@@ sians .
they asked themselves whether they have repeated controversy to a greater problem that the company has diversity .
the news and the indign@@ ation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The ver@@ ge and mother@@ boards , a day after sn@@ ap@@ chat shared that it had de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as caricature of A@@ sians .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism , the filter was reminded of breaking c@@ lich@@ és .
others declined to the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean American student , whose twe@@ et about the photos were widely used that the filter was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and mild . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the ju@@ x@@ tap@@ osition of a very conflic@@ ting Asian caricature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not di@@ visible , but that the yel@@ lowing was drawn into the extreme extreme .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural sep@@ tic .
the American culture seems to have been involved in an endless poetry and integration process , from meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are di@@ vers@@ ed in terms of race as their older counterparts - could expect more of them to expect sensitivity .
if one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters is created an image that is offen@@ ded for a user , so it is harder that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who works as Produc@@ man@@ ag@@ erin and Engineering works for the medium , has called her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview , she said that her imp@@ acting controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the installation practices at sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the great part of white , only male &apos;s leadership and ended their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colour in their workforce so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese I @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin @-@ colors that work there , but not in positions they feel safe or comfortable to say what about it . &quot;
others share their mind , a complaint , the Sn@@ ap@@ chat largely left un@@ answered .
the Company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its employees and shows its status as a private company .
on Thursday , Sn@@ ap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees , but according to a speaker , the company recently focused on a recruitment agency who focuses on sub@@ sets populations and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu said in turn , that they will be closed her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not o.@@ k . &quot;
military management of ISIS &apos; intelligence information , presented in the conference Committee
military members of the United States Central Command changed im@@ pl@@ ated information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , so it would have allowed the actual states on site , in a report on Thursday .
the P@@ rel@@ im@@ inary Report , created by a Task Force on Republi@@ can members of Defence Committee , Intelligence Tu@@ es@@ ent@@ ees and the Wehr@@ bud@@ get@@ ent@@ es , reports about great dis@@ content at Central Command secret services , which reported how anticip@@ ation expressed criticism of the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operation in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence &quot; information that is typically im@@ plau@@ ded by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Com@@ man@@ de@@ uren , has consistently been a positive image of American efforts against terrorism , and were generally positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; commented a newspaper article .
&quot; what has happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering , if bad analysis are presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives .
the command error in Cent@@ Com range from the top of the organisation .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed resistance in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi army .
although there is no direct indications that government tips to change under Obama &apos;s instructions , it shows how analysts got exposed to the pressure from their supervis@@ ors , an optimistic image of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or Isi@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press statements , statements and statements made before the Congress were significantly more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Cent@@ Com An@@ archy was publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ s@@ s could start in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ su@@ l , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , republi@@ can Congress of K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 the leaders of the Central Command changed the following intelligence reports to play against the threat of ISIS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ can spro@@ ut the Task Force in Life , after they ended up that analysts are worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report released on Thursday will be supple@@ mented by more detailed findings during investigations .
additional investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are carried through by the general public @-@ spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defence .
democratic members of the news media reports published their own findings on Thursday to deal with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of in@@ richt@@ ing sub@@ missions to Isi@@ l and the Iraqi security services , &quot; he gave Adam B. ship , a member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Shi@@ p , in an opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , so Mr. &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; delayed the publication of trend @-@ based reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; har@@ sh@@ ing mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was little room for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. ships and democrats gave no evidence of intervention in the White House at Cent@@ Com analyses with regard to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported by investigations by the general spec@@ tor of the Pentagon , which were recorded after complaints of Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st .
Fr . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press secretary of the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on reports of Congress , while investig@@ ating the General Dis@@ spec@@ tor were still under progress .
but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense . &quot;
the investigation of investigations on the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that has been made by an increasing number of members of the Defense Department ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year , however , raised the question of how President Obama can count on the Central Command for hon@@ orable assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of secrecy about the Islamic State is about to recall , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a writing about how the then government under George W. Bush looked contrary to the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation of occupation in Iraq and had little time on it to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team around Mr. Hoo@@ ker claims to ensure that contrary to the statements of the government ass@@ aults against the Islamic State reg@@ res@@ ists would have had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these provisional refinement were put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
but this finding was not published , the Times in September reported .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ alist Command , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legis@@ lature by his over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin went to retirement in April and was replaced at the Central Command through Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the U.S. won fourth pilot in the field @-@ ho@@ ckey of the women , a show@@ down with Britain .
a day after they shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 winner , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that won the American with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually be an unforgettable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; I said .
I don &apos;t belong to people who keep their gates in memory .
however , they know they are : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equivalent in their group to the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan remained un@@ defeated .
Britain and the United States will encounter the first round on Saturday in the last round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group .
the first bur@@ ner will go a little longer from the way , which will guide the other group .
whatever the game may start on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex through their success story , four years after they ended up in the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
B@@ AM was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years of playing a ho@@ ckey club in his hands ( her two older sisters performed the Sport at the Dre@@ xel university ) , at 16 years she became national player in the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
it missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 as it could not qualify for the cad@@ res .
then came the year 2012 , in which she and her team went all wrong .
in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham was said , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , the coach of the National Team , and thus began to turn things for better .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the work@@ book in London that we now have .
we have the helm completely s@@ nat@@ ch .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the cake in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the clo@@ se@@ up area .
India had gone out into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and kept the playing field from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am started the game into their hands .
it took a Sprint with the flat ball through the left flan@@ k , then moved to the center and lu@@ te the ball into the gate to get the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 leadership .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez finished the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keepers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of Er@@ ol@@ ins
wherever you are , as late it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are permanent and in@@ es@@ capable , a fast run rel@@ ay between competition and pursuit .
it is like the Olympic f@@ ack@@ el itself would be a burning approach , which is lit from the wr@@ ist@@ band to s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ athletes towards the tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn off the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the queue in the coffee shop without using Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ covers or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time in the Olympics and a wom@@ an@@ ate with grass , could have been made entirely under these known names that would be sent to Prime Time , by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising , if he would be a swi@@ mmer , gymn@@ asts , or even fen@@ nel .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights in the Olympic trampoline for gold .
the Olympic flame is not lit any event immediately .
further from the center , partially in the shade are the sports that are not commonly recognized : air p@@ istol , ar@@ chery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast swimming and let it reign .
but if I would like to make a modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me direct attention to the discreet char@@ me of the trampoline .
although the trampoline had already been a Olympic Event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it became the last 16 years so spar@@ se that many people had asked , did not know that it is at all a olymp@@ as@@ port@@ art .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to competition , there has never won a medal in the trampoline and had had a athletes until 2012 , who made it to the final .
the Chinese and the Russians were incl@@ ined to share the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans who share them .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the bo@@ under jumping rope has a certain out@@ iter@@ ation char@@ me , partly because it sounds for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear to be more suitable for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a rec@@ our@@ er enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the car@@ to@@ on@@ ous tre@@ mb@@ ling of his never to end wolf @-@ up - but also the Grazie of the turn@@ around and diving , the two sports that are essentially united .
the word &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
growing winners jump on a gigantic re@@ bo@@ under , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of slo@@ ping movements ( turning , he@@ dges and sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet .
they are evaluated al@@ oud , according to official Olympics by execution , difficulty , and &quot; flight time . &quot;
most vulnerable athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women are compete in Rio .
the common olymp@@ ic vector is straight .
med@@ all@@ ists must continue in their quest for gold , faster , upward and above go , sometimes up to the destination , sometimes down and back , up and down on the playground .
they are hunting for not only the finish line or the initial wall , but also in the television transmission , also another height @-@ height : those of the world or the Olympi@@ ad .
the goal @-@ oriented endeavor is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir even a spect@@ ator .
but it &apos;s also what I feel when looking at these games as something ti@@ ring .
this trampoline offers a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the vector of the trampoline is above .
a forward @-@ moving movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ce off , apparently wei@@ ght@@ lessness as an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes upwards , then effortlessly back upwards .
again there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the target , no curved into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it &apos;s so Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games may only be .
the qualification and end of the women will be held on Friday afternoon , in the streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC is the En@@ dr@@ ing as part of an after@@ no@@ bloc at both days from 14 : 00 .
in the midst of Olympia Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably overlooked in the general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear and objectiv@@ ity of male athletes , as it won the male US Tur@@ ner under the The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his coming to air rin@@ se , new fan@@ atics .
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long ( ally ) of the USA
violent protest in Ethiopia
demonstrators that demand political changes in Ethiopia stand to violent resistance from the government .
witnesses say that zig prot@@ esters were killed during the cl@@ ashes with the police in dro@@ ught .
is Ethiopia just to break up together ?
over the last ten years , it has been one of Africa &apos;s stabili@@ zing countries , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last few months protests against the government shaken protests against the government , and left out in more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med down the streets and slow @-@ fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the response of the government was un@@ mer@@ ciful .
witnesses gave that poli@@ cem@@ an on an un@@ armed demonstr@@ ator shot and killed .
in the round @-@ well @-@ being videos about protests , which probably are from the last or beginning of this year , show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Security Agency for Human Rights now demands a more detailed investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it becomes even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiop@@ ians to combat terrorism across the region , particularly in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help .
Ethiop@@ ian economy expanded at the pres@@ cient pace .
his infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new swing train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but an example to democracy - human rights organizations have continuously taken the repression of the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , whereby the dissi@@ dents were effectively brought to silence .
many have been sent into exile or sent to prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert .
but this could change .
&quot; if you press people and they do not have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lec@@ turer in Central Ethiop@@ ian .
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous ail@@ ments that cover all from the bottom line to the spice in relation to the power of the ruling coalition .
after a far more critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies got the final seat of the opposition , and now control 100 percent of parliament .
at the same time , the tensions along the border to Eritrea ; a battle for this pron@@ ged , controversial line continued in June , hundreds of lives .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the Oro@@ mo Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ ga@@ des , which were imposed more or less in recent years , could benefit the turbul@@ ence and re@@ ar@@ ming themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ ing after years of exposure under the surface are now explo@@ ding .
the first appears to harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians had been able to communicate via social media because cheaper smartphones have always been more frequent and improved the internet services .
even if the government is blocked access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially at protests , many people still can communicate via internet Pro@@ x@@ ies to hide , where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians agreed that they gathered so to protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since branches of prosp@@ ered the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia &apos;s overwhel@@ m@@ ingly Christian peak countries , in politics and economics , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in flat @-@ land areas .
but even this is just changing .
&quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the biggest protests were held in areas of the Am@@ hara and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of tigers , which constitute around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in military , in commerce and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , has until his death on an un@@ publi@@ zed disease in 2012 17 years Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister .
he was regarded as a tactical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts are saying that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in giving early signs of dis@@ cont@@ entment and special officers to handle opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present regime is lacking in this fundamental trade , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively un@@ supervised reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
contrary to Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Albania , Mr. Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts are saying that he does not enjoy the confidence of the safety control of the Tig@@ ray controlled security services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had been living a turmoil in 2005 , after thousands of elections were prot@@ esting , which was in@@ fu@@ elled by the government according to particulars and were then stolen by the government .
during the following swe@@ eps many demonstrators were killed , even if it were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest was passed relatively quickly .
Develop@@ mental Experts : Ethiop@@ ian guide for their visionary infrastructure planning , as the new pend@@ ant train , as well as for their measurable progress in the fight against poverty .
but obviously this does not have the intention of the internal mis@@ g@@ un@@ st of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month &apos;s prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ an city , by Tig@@ ray run businesses and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is increasingly experienced in social media .
analy@@ st say that the protests were the USA and other Western allies in a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a base for chat@@ ting flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if they recently shared that they closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want his allies to collapse in an already volati@@ le zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; migration &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his claim Obama was ISIS &apos; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to sc@@ atter the last controversy on Friday which surround his campaign by att@@ acking his repeatedly stim@@ ated claim , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton , would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State . &quot;
this clari@@ fying statement made new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ can candidate ( re@@ public@@ ans ) whether he was able to communicate with the American public .
it also brings forth his collaborators , who make an effort to take him during an un@@ eventful phase in protecting the peculiar position that he could not have meant at all .
after he had made the clear@@ ance during an election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp returned in relation to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really did not intend to admit to the President and Mrs. Clinton had ISIS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was simply sar@@ cas@@ tic .
the twe@@ et was the opposite to the previous day when Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely seriously .
when the conservative radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t &apos;s Mr. Tru@@ mp wanted to help weak@@ en this statement , rec@@ alled that Mr. Obama wants to destroy it , did not want to know the republi@@ can presidential guard .
the last thunder@@ storm of the criticism is shining down on Mr. Tru@@ mp , while he tried to direct the focus of his campaign due to the conclusion of the demand for the economic situation .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton stopped talking to the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return again to this topic .
comm@@ itting on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already submitted sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he received strong criticism of herself , when he said , the Russians were to cho@@ ke Mrs. Clin@@ &apos;s E@@ mails , but he explained later &quot; of course , I said the sar@@ cas@@ tically . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to move the language boundaries in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of its methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans how they arrive , and then where appropriate &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication extrem@@ ist who observed the language of both candidates .
but I think it &apos;s cle@@ verly enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of def@@ ying the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tru@@ mp has an even reck@@ less sound assumed , because its re@@ frac@@ tures have gone further .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a guided tour with great lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ on @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tru@@ mp generally tries to not have to apologize for its pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often accused his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to understand his humour .
but while he is reinforced in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal co @-@ meeting into the in@@ convenient situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements like to be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s most prominent advocates , gave a great effort to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani has asked him to be the truth of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS is an almost unknown , small organization , he called it bot@@ t@@ ames , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he dra@@ fted troops from Iraq .
most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as an external minister@@ ial Minister , it allowed ISIS to spread themselves by bringing the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp resum@@ ed its attacks on the media and cast them out on each of his words and to be taken against him .
he mo@@ ck@@ ery the &quot; poor , &quot; w@@ ran@@ som &quot; TV experts who try to understand and said , &quot; You cannot do it ! &quot;
some of the democrats had mo@@ cked about Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s ap@@ ology as only one further proof that he would be un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once more pressing the price of the market , café in Green@@ point is coming back
Ver@@ b Cafe was a s@@ hab@@ by café in Williamsburg , in which one could only pay cash , which no wi @-@ fi had , but for 15 years of good coffee .
obviously , thanks to the prices of his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ Front has been pushed .
the business So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , made in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
locals mour@@ ned it as the last loss in a hostile city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ abs wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe CB@@ GB dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b now is a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is change , then it is new finding .
a recovered Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is also still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ time employee of the old cafe , the owner and managing director of the new coffee bar .
he started working in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered him a customer to provide money for a new out@@ post office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , held a lot of things .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els , the same es@@ presso machine .
it even uses the same lamps from the old Ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez told that he also wanted to experiment .
he led new ingredients .
on the menu , sand@@ wiches are packed with sp@@ agh@@ etti and cheese and there are y@@ or@@ ages like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted oni@@ ons .
there is Natur@@ re@@ iss@@ ls .
the cafe does not serve beer more , there are fresh juices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after nine months Rodri@@ guez told that he has noticed a stable current of old regular customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also eliminated by awards from Williamsburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently at a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ vei@@ ra was one such customer .
Oli@@ vei@@ ra , 34 , dwelt in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way .
after the verb had closed , she gave a while the coffee @-@ swal@@ low left , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that it was on the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee , even if she ordered this day instead of her usual I@@ ced Coffee , a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i tea , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long @-@ term and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003 .
he went there before work and inv@@ ari@@ ably always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss watch watch , and they prepare for Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez he said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal can still get his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez he said that he did not take a Gro@@ ll about that the soap @-@ business has taken the old business room .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ ery offered a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold coffee of the cafes as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go on to her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish and green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu to the Polish and Rodri@@ guez he said he has imagined to make her feel soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome .
the site also has other advantages .
a local saf@@ ari room would like to fill and sell the cold coffee in the bottle .
there is a chance that the café has expanded to a nearby building .
for many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was master , and said that he was destroyed on the ground , when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that praying at the Lok@@ als and the Par@@ king felt a new coffee like a return home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to sm@@ ack &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the depres@@ sing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an abundant meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roo@@ sev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as g@@ our@@ mets , President Roo@@ sev@@ elt had a fin@@ alist for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water @-@ turtles .
his menu on this day was a little more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato p@@ anc@@ akes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of mascul@@ ini@@ cian solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Bar@@ gel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Andrew Co@@ e said , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot;
married couple lives in Brooklyn Heights , and they are both a food historian .
Co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was one of the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while goat in her book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; tells about life in a residential home in the Lower East Side of the food perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A decent meal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a Reporter at the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich shop , a small , straightforward snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which is already in business since the IP@@ O crash .
goat , 54 , ordered a fresh wine @-@ he@@ ap with olive oil , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture .
when the repor@@ ters ordered him , this found the couple for discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; he said goat .
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver and bean bread .
they were made of an ingredient and a little cheap to dispute the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ anu@@ ts to eat as they serve them as supp@@ er .
Co@@ e gr@@ in@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have placed in the stomach as a lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ buffet .
teams of women co@@ sting for male field lab@@ our@@ ers and it was served fresh baked past@@ ures for breakfast , lunch and dinner served .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Square meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paints the ways that the country was transformed , no longer to be the s@@ lar@@ a land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when eating for Americans was a central , tense issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beg@@ ged Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
equally tense was the new budget s@@ own : mysterious food such as loaves and K@@ asser@@ ts were found to stap@@ le food , the water wool as &quot; wonderful species , food @-@ remains re@@ pri@@ zed , &quot; mer@@ ated bricks where chefs could hide from appe@@ tizing ingredients under a circular sauce .
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheap dry Ries@@ ling .
meat , which was the center of the American cuisine for years , became a rare and fourth luxury .
peculiar an@@ ings have been tried out , because a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nour@@ ished grati@@ fication has priority prior to taste or even healthy cooking .
during her research for the book , which includes recipes , she prepared goat from that epoch , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ an@@ ut butter , .
&quot; there was no more popular addition at lun@@ ch@@ time , &quot; says Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zie@@ gel@@ mann goes on from : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked oni@@ ons fit not to each other .
it was typical for many of the home@@ coming recipes .
as never before or since then , fiscal economical - including Louise Stan@@ ley , leader of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 @-@ 1943 to 1943 - the country &apos;s food habits .
by making the recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; bud@@ get@@ ary policy &quot; and the challenge to transform the pamp@@ as like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots in delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a celebration of historical treat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
particularly tasty are the reports of the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving people , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cakes @-@ food post@@ ure .
while he is public praised the simple I@@ owa Farm@@ house in his kitchen , he spec@@ ters like the multi @-@ million severe man of the world that he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
it ate in an almost gold @-@ pl@@ ated dining room and wearing a tu@@ x@@ e@@ king .
he was marvel@@ ous to realistic .
President Roo@@ sev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ anor had to do it to stat@@ u@@ ze with his stomach .
as described in the book , the recru@@ it of a land@@ lady with no interest in flavours with Mrs. Roo@@ sev@@ elt took that the White House brought forth the most boring food in Washington , but one of the most dri@@ est . &quot;
many of the species from the era of the Great Depression , to deal with food , was rejected as soon as the land returned to its feet .
the legacy is on our continued focus on cal@@ orie and food , &quot; Zie@@ gel@@ man , &quot; as well as on how science on food has been applied .
the couple gave to the writing of the book the eating habits of goat @-@ in @-@ law better understood - for example how they could not throw food away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the wast@@ age of food &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; goat was reminded : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did actually get sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were the wind@@ shield .
after the plates were vac@@ ated at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s wings , they and Co@@ e had made a dessert that they had home : the pl@@ ums to eat Roo@@ sev@@ elt , with lunch .
&quot; there is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Sp@@ ru@@ man and added that there was a nasty trick , humble recipes to be missed out .
there was no wa@@ xed not@@ ch , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone num@@ b somewhat reluct@@ antly to put a spoon into the tough , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it did not tasted bad .
Co@@ e won three times a p@@ unch .
like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ zer he said to his wife , &quot; A few har@@ acked wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
when bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he continued his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ki@@ cked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died on a fac@@ et attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Omar was a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a civil protection group , which has saved the life according to image newspaper to barely 60@@ ,000 people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
2@@ 900 volunteers manage their own lives in order to draw people from bom@@ bed homes and help first aid in the war .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
Omar was the face of a group : a video of the civil servant who showed him during a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a baby shot from the rub@@ ble of a house , went to the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans of the shining symbolic figure in the Gre@@ ys of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as heroes he never seen himself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the image : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me it is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I am dying to save life , I think that God gives me a mar@@ ty@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before it fell victim to the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria .
the Heli@@ kop@@ ter have b@@ lown out four stor@@ ey@@ s above the Alzheimer &apos;s district , one was filled with chlor@@ ine .
a woman and two children died , seven men suffer from brea@@ ths .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we remove the poison@@ ous remn@@ ants of the bomb , so that not children play , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; c@@ ites the image of his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland : the el@@ dest whir@@ l is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland properties are mostly only in the winter for the surface .
this Ha@@ i was allowed to go back to the sea after an examination on board ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic Ocean - to the present day .
Greenland patients have only been born with 150 years of offspring .
stran@@ gely , the Greenland shar@@ ks alongside the North Atlantic ocean , in an hour , it occurs on average just 1.@@ 220 feet far .
only when it arrives , the five meters long pet speeds up to 2,@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a ro@@ be with this top speed .
this influenced life @-@ shaped lifestyle seems to be a pan@@ acea for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science &quot; in any case by a Greenland entity that could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; madness , &quot; comments Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein from the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life @-@ span that represents a world record for verteb@@ rates .
although the evolution@@ ist bi@@ ologist suspected for a long time , that Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie will be st@@ ony .
only missing the evidence .
Greenland hair are difficult to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the thin@@ ly populated coastal area of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water @-@ temperatures around the 6 degrees Celsius , they usually dive at the surface mostly only during winter .
with little about the lifestyle of Greenland researchers know accordingly little .
their time pent@@ ine measurements protects them , when they wi@@ ped six animals to a radio station in front of the Spit@@ s@@ bergen .
loot make this shar@@ ks nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remn@@ ants of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw @-@ bear .
possibly they chase them sle@@ ep@@ y animals or pat@@ rolled at the bottom of the ice cream and look car@@ c@@ asses that cr@@ ush out of higher water layers .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 prior to Greenland or Spit@@ s@@ bergen as a by@@ catch from the depth of North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the maximum 50@@ 2 centimeters is measurement .
in order to identify the age of the animals , they analyzed with the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ method the l@@ apping of shar@@ ks .
this centre of the eyel@@ iner comes before the birth of shar@@ ks , which in it are no longer renewed in it .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the liner .
their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , when nuclear ar@@ ming tests bigger amounts of this radio@@ active carbon impact into the atmosphere .
in the smallest animal with 220 centimeters in length , the len@@ tic@@ ity contained a low surplus to carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in its investigation in 2012 .
all the major Greenland patients had in their lenses , on the contrary , normal carbon @-@ 14 @-@ quantities which arises from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed a 4@@ 93 cen@@ tim@@ etres long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k at the age of 3@@ 35 years , during the record @-@ shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimeters , can be even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k only got offspring after they are longer than four meters , was well @-@ known .
now researchers can assign the length of their length .
as one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimeters , probably at the threshold to the sexually mature age and his age with 15@@ 6 years was determined , Greenland with the multip@@ lication obviously dropped at least one and a half centuries .
also this is likely to be a world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ ion@@ als live mainly in icy waters is not a coincidence .
even the previous record @-@ holder , a 211 @-@ year old Greenland , in whose sp@@ y on N@@ acking a 120 year old Har@@ po@@ on pointed out , was captured prior to Alaska .
due to the low temperatures also the organism of the animals living there live on as@@ par@@ ation .
so they mature even later - and age slower .
to keep warm in cold water , the animals often become particularly large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal ri@@ bs heat .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram@@ mes elephant .
a further advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal is more dangerous and should concentrate to have as many offspring as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary little ologist Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein .
a very big animal was supposed to invest their resources rather than a long life .

&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief the Committee adopted the Communication by Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently @-@ proven housing can start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the estate of the estate , par@@ cel@@ ess and replacement questions were clarified and the applications for survey failed , the sale of plots in the residential areas &quot; road @-@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - section 1 ) an interested prospective buyers have nothing more in the way .
the com@@ mon@@ place is convinced that the b@@ abo@@ o in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au appe@@ aled young families and fam@@ ers alike .
as it was , building contractors can report immediately in the city hall , on the allocation of plots , the council is expected to advise in its September meeting .
in order to also request requests to the relocation of other commercial companies , combined with the creation of jobs , we decided to change the council , which will only be re@@ generated in the spring of this year to change the breeding plan plan in part areas .
thus , in the area of Unter@@ s@@ lar@@ n , this is already seen in the business area around two par@@ c@@ els in the direction of the state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
the city on the Main has therefore in competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , with the best opportunities to move jobs and companies from London .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is most likely that Frankfurt benefits from the Bre@@ xit @-@ vote &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ saw , head of the competence sector of the financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after Bre@@ xit &apos;s referendum , it is uncertain whether budgets are now allowed to run from London from financial transactions across the EU .
for the so @-@ called EU @-@ pass , they have so far enough marketing approval in the UK .
these are just great US banks .
several banks have already announced plans to shift jobs .
the Lob@@ bying Association Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; expects 10@@ 000 new jobs on the Main Event for five years .
for Frankfurt , such as I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , re@@ united the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area , as well as further important authorities like the European insurance company E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk plant ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less important for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the emergency bank is important for banks as they can communicate so directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg although a large fund business , cuts , however , as well as Dublin at the infrastructure worse off .
Frankfurt be significantly easier thanks to the large airport .
furthermore the city with readily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also at the Seine are also renting for first class commercial properties by 50 percent higher than on the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt also offer a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a rankings to the Merc@@ er &apos;s business office , the city occupies 10th place , Luxembourg in No. 19 , Dublin on position 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if the quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European Common Market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; then the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in spite of Bre@@ xit @-@ vote the main financial center in Europe will remain , my econom@@ ist scientists .
the power relations also speak : in London in accordance with figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 approximately 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking sector , in Frankfurt it were 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead will receive legal costs from the Hepatitis C patent @-@ it with Mer@@ ck
a US executive committee decided that Gilead and Inc . the charges of the legal costs have , which were created from the Hep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co .
in June , Gilead was freed from a claim payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which stood in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster medications So@@ val@@ di and Harv@@ oni from Gilead , after an American judge stood a pattern of mis@@ behavior of Mer@@ cks , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other un@@ ethical acts .
in the case of the law@@ suit conducted on Thursday US official Ju@@ son of Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to reimbur@@ se the costs that have ar@@ isen during the defense of the case .
Mer@@ ck attempts with Gilead to treat the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver illness .
the case dates back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck , each other compl@@ ained and ownership on laboratory work , to whom Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir coinci@@ des , the active ingredient in the medication of Gilead .
supported by the United States that they have rec@@ laimed full control over Man@@ bi@@ j by the Islamic State

the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) , after the excerpt of the remaining group of fighters who dig themselves off within the city , currently the city .
they have been released over 2,000 civilians , who were held from the fighters as ho@@ stages , shared Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Car@@ bi@@ j Military Council Re@@ uters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control but we are just running cold cuts through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Re@@ uters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ &apos;s earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % German control
Hill@@ ary Clinton announced their tax return for 2015 , revealed by the Democrats and their husband a income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective Federal tax rate of 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % .
in 2015 , the Clin@@ &apos;s USD 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton generated an income of USD 3 million by Verlag Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for her book on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ president , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , his declaration of tax published in the past ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to uph@@ old standards regarding financial transparency , &quot; Clin@@ &apos;s Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ fer@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ mi@@ eri was known in an opinion .
in a cr@@ ass contradiction , Donald Tru@@ mp is hiding behind false interpre@@ ters and reg@@ isters in relation to his current promises his tax rul@@ ings to publish .
it is custom@@ ary for US presidential guard to publish their tax @-@ ties , although they are not obliged by law to do so .
Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have stated as a reason for his denial made a tax examination by the tax authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clin@@ &apos;s election campaign in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter as regards the President of the Presidential candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tru@@ mp@@ s special advis@@ er , to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish anything before the tax inspec@@ tors were not completed .
Tru@@ mp@@ s critics , among others , also the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already made re@@ vo@@ ci@@ ble that his ref@@ usal questions in regard to assets , his donations to charitable organisations , his business bro@@ ws and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already j@@ umped on the subject and published a video on the Internet in the high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp requested to publish its tax return .
on Thursday she also spoke the subject of a speech to the economy of Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what has done every other presidential election in recent decades and to publish its declaration of tax . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico has reported that Tru@@ mp has paid none or only very few taxes for two years , and a commercial colum@@ n@@ ist of the New York Times posted a series of tax evasion and tax advis@@ ors , the indications that this might still be the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; federal controls have become an issue in electoral campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and Investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would ensure that people earn more than USD 1 million and pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a election event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the past week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters here , Tru@@ mp into a meeting in order to share their tax exemp@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said , he was also subjected to a tax examination of IR@@ S and Tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ &apos;s campaign launched a tax return in 2007 to 2007 .
the Clin@@ &apos;s , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , has paid an effective Federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective tax rate of about 4@@ 0.5 % .
the tax return of the Clin@@ &apos;s Liber@@ ation from 2015 showed that only USD 100 of their income are compared to wages , unlike most of all Americans .
their main content was an effective Inde@@ x@@ ic fund , from which the Clin@@ &apos;s dividends and income was controlled by USD 10@@ 9.@@ 000 .

condoms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works esc@@ ort will promote dance ani@@ as elephant
natur@@ alist in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from staying in people inhabited settlements - they throw condoms on them that are filled with chi@@ le pu@@ li@@ der .
the method turned out to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had already begun years ago , together with the US nature conservation institution , having trained volunteers in villages in the north of Tanzania , to use a non @-@ violent @-@ stage method for the protection of their houses and harvest without being injured .
previously , many sp@@ amm@@ ers have used to defend oneself .
Friday is a call that is dedicated to the field of animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe in these churches a change of attitude , taking them much more confidence that they can hold the eleph@@ ants off their fields without damaging the eleph@@ ants , &quot; expressed the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Damian Bell in a message .
the first two steps cover the light of the eleph@@ ants with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles into a horn .
when he is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; is cast .
the Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ works con@@ mer@@ ry in a con@@ dom , its end up to the ig@@ ni@@ tion is shot .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom comes with a kno@@ b and spray the fine dust of Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der in the air .

a last chance is a laun@@ cher who sho@@ ots a gold fired power plant in the air while causing a loud , bright explosion .
unanim@@ ous decision was taken unanim@@ ously : no ki@@ osk on St. Go@@ at Rhein@@ u@@ fer
normally , the civil builders for entrepreneurs take home from the tra@@ des@@ men over the tra@@ des@@ men - but it is just the retail industry located in the core city as much de@@ af@@ able .
however , the application for the new construction of a sales network at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ Main R@@ ally declined by the City Council now interven@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , we welcome new business operators , but on this location in exp@@ on@@ ated position on the Rhine @-@ ki@@ osk this ki@@ osk does not fit in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director sh@@ ook Berlin Hotel , because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
a French director , with Jewish roots , un@@ le@@ ashed a media recording , after he adm@@ its that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had no Israeli pres@@ election as it would have requested Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , author of the Holocaust @-@ documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his struggles at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by wrote an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lan@@ z@@ mann tried to find Israel on the site of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed among the countries which can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it in Berlin , the capital of Germany &apos;s new Germany , is possible that Israel has eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lan@@ z@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol has a way to choose Israel via its own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer that he received there , &quot; sho@@ ved him , &quot; as Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel provided that the measure is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inten@@ tional decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it stood , sol@@ der in the director even more anger .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; the set of Lan@@ z@@ mann cited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das Multi@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great shame &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were de@@ composed of this event and troubled .
this is really very embarrassing .
the fact that this has occurred in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater shame .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions : &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident triggered a fairly large resonance on the internet , in which people called the whole sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some under@@ took the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that there would have been the alleged enumer@@ ation of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; ashamed to you &quot; as it was stated in another article , in which it was advised that the hotel , which is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue .
the hotel quickly pointed out all accus@@ ations of themselves and called the incident , and &quot; exc@@ used &quot; at Lan@@ z@@ mann , reports The Spiegel .
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; Israel would not include in the speed@@ way list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung describes a spokes@@ person of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
it adds that the di@@ alling code has now been added .

trade between Russia &amp; Iran will suddenly rise to 71 % - RT Business
according to the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade agreement between Moscow and Teheran in the year comparison increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent .
since the international sanctions imposed on Iran , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly in businesses in the country , the ambassador dealt with .
Russian companies have established existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further trade is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the exchange rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , the Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amoun@@ ted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade down@@ turn was reached by supplies of machines , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year .
last year the Russian foreign representative offices around 3@@ 5.000 Vis@@ as , primarily in Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
furthermore , Iran achieved the top 20 countries of the country , which concerns the number of tourists in Russia .
one could say that the record @-@ paying tourists in Russia from last year began to be broken , &quot; he said .
at the same time only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; personally , I can recommend the visit to the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have received the monumental civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : Pil@@ gri@@ m to the P@@ forte of Mer@@ cy
the min@@ ist@@ rants from the past@@ oral Valley E@@ m@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna had on his way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage of Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages have been tac@@ kled .
in order to survive the time up to the next Rom@@ s@@ wir@@ ing of all min@@ ist@@ rants in two years , the Ober@@ min@@ ist@@ ran@@ ger &apos;s round St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage goals have been checked and one was finally decided for the bish@@ ops of Freiburg , where he opened a special pilgrimage to the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , with the opening of Mer@@ cy of Mer@@ ger &apos;s Mer@@ ge Münster , and a special pilgrimage .
16 Min@@ is of the Bitt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Heiligen@@ stad , were on the way .
in the evening before the priest &apos;s flock sent the pilgrims in a little celebration in St. Anna , bl@@ esses the Pil@@ gri@@ ms and told the pilgrimage .
from Hor@@ b , I was driven by train to the starting point of Vill@@ ingen , where a Mu@@ enster @-@ loved woman is at stake , and so the pilgrimage path was de@@ away from the Münster .
the single day tours were held in the morning and in the evening , depending on a short impulse with various prayers , songs and writing .
but also on the road the Min@@ is made to Feld@@ crosses , chap@@ els , or churches again and again in a time to sing a song from an independent pilgri@@ m pen .
for the nights we were at your disposal a parish church of the local parish .
at the destination Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller were keen to produce sav@@ our@@ y dishes and breakfast .
on the second day he went over Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
tags at this stage were the stage to St. Peter , which was the exhau@@ sting road route , but at first we had to be climbed with swe@@ eping heat at first approximately 500 altitude metres and then climbed up again .
the deserved reward was a joint gri@@ lling on the bathing .
after the dawn of the fourth pilgrimage day in the majestic Klo@@ st@@ ak@@ erial church of St. Peter it went on the sle@@ ek stage after Freiburg .
visi@@ bly facilitated and happy met the Min@@ is at the later afternoon in the open @-@ day city of Münster , and passed through the gate of Mer@@ cy .
with a small impulse , God was thanks to God .
in the evening mass in Münster , the at the pilgrimage of Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus O@@ bert were greeted .
after the service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ r@@ isty and the high @-@ stand .
the next day there was time for the Bre@@ a@@ Gau@@ met@@ ropole .

Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rus@@ hes to get home as Br@@ it Gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s call to Sk@@ inner &apos;s last evening in the Men &apos;s Sprint in Rio for fame , when the British team def@@ ends the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the roll as his landing was made by Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the young and made the legend that he finished home to enter a victory of the favor@@ ites New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympics history .
they reiter@@ ated the trick after they took place in March at the railways World Championships in London despite the back@@ end Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the issue between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver of Jamie Staff .
they did this in good time as execution .
Ho@@ ys re@@ tire re@@ produces a gap , the K@@ ian E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ acker trying to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man , in which they stayed , when they saw potential in the br@@ isk , that now un@@ folds .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - who won four years ago with Ho@@ y and Sk@@ inner in the Quali@@ fication Round a Olympi@@ ad record , but in the Stand@@ ar@@ ters the New Zealand won the New Zealand in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ der lay in after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner stopped it .
a strategy change made a great part of the transformation , for the execution in a higher gear to slow him down , and to allow it Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as BBC expert and fell to Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der as these got on the podium .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am just here to do my best and make a name for me .
we have been in the En@@ dr@@ unde , a Olympics @-@ ch@@ ord and the world champion has been defeated .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the spring of 2012 , on the side of the tra@@ ys and Ho@@ ys there was no indication that he fell on the train after a weak start .
he returned this statement later and there was no objection of England Rival .
with so much victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like the whole of the UK and the grand@@ stand like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last three months we have come together as a team .
we &apos;ve come so badly with so many sur@@ titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven of 10 titles in both Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the past five months , we expect successful five days in Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form of characteristic is it in the field of possible that he won the victory of three Olympic gold medals in a contest .
that would mean for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( an apparently holy date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger B@@ ann@@ ister was born ) - a prize of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the cheese of by Ho@@ y alike .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint that will start today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team @-@ event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lonely and alone to win .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he gains two more gold medals , he should be defeated to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal winner of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll compete with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four o@@ dom@@ eter running .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
the world record , which won 2012 in London gold was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of the competition where Wig@@ gins will focus on safety .
he had stri@@ cken with himself yesterday in front of the qualification as he sm@@ ote him to measure his height .
in the proportionate women &apos;s competition that will continue tomorrow and ended , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Row@@ y S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ soon of Mil@@ n@@ gav@@ y in world records in 4 : 13.@@ 260 .
the GB team leaves itself on his strong rail wheel team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to take a shot of medals .
after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio dropped off .
as a result , Dr@@ amas played in the background so the resignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ c@@ um and har@@ ass@@ ures , as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ leton .
but when one looks at the first evening of competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite that the well @-@ known call of GB@@ s , who has reached its peak at the perfect moment .
future of the m@@ elt from Portland due to the lifting of the energy patient
the future of the aluminium mel@@ tdown from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - standing on the game , since the plant operators will announce the energy supplier and thus will lift all delivery contracts , such as the supplier of energy companies .
this step followed by the government &apos;s decision at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a Sub@@ si@@ diary set up for 20 years in November .
there are up to 2000 jobs in the complex of Al@@ coa in Portland queue at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closing .
in addition , it could come to domin@@ als effect , as the melting pot is around 10 per cent of total electricity - Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as consum@@ es .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa completed the Point Henry melting , which led the last year to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ man power station .
m@@ elt from Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and risky a closure .
this step follows the years of speculation in regard to the future of the plant , originally as a result of the vigor@@ ous Australia dollar and last due to the power station for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplied the large aluminum melting together with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , shared with the fact that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the complex is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p can hold small shares .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Portland continues to be operated , which means another physical demand for electricity through the melting pot , &quot; shared the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts are called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he@@ dging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should come into effect from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month period of notice , so they will end 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to the revenue in the fiscal year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on revenues at AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong cutting markets for wholesale transfer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L dealt with the value of the contracts already in its annual accounts in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the treaties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... have the melting shop or to ensure the power supply to the melting system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. company said that in 2010 it completed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which of November this year would have entered into force , even though it is still an explanation of why it has res@@ igned by the contract .
analysts warn of the bad economic circumstances of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland melting shop in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near Newcastle .
in reference to the statements of the analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations , Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland is spent around 600 me@@ gawatts and Tom@@ ago about 900 me@@ gawatts of electricity .
if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as an generating set , this would not be good . &quot; he said .
more than just a car@@ d@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the F@@ gue of Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ ger and mother of the Kar@@ an@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is in the cover of the cov@@ eted Sept@@ em@@ ber@@ th of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and ran on the Fashion We@@ eks of Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on her Inst@@ agram account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this co@@ ver@@ ver brought me to we@@ eping &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unvei@@ ling of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Car@@ d@@ hi@@ an family ) , the whole Kar@@ an@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ lyn as well as in the presence of the more popular show@@ bi@@ z un@@ cle and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as it ends with a classic turn : you have all planned a surprise party .
that represents the cl@@ apping sep@@ t@@ iness of nearly every birthday sep@@ t@@ ember a child &apos;s return ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the proposition , &quot; You covered it ? , &quot; with the honesty of a cartoon animation on a station at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls go somehow to this journalist .
with a view to the September of September , Vo@@ gue has certainly started a new era of the Kar@@ an@@ hi@@ ans .
K@@ end@@ alls great sister Kim likes them , what the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned , they have beaten ( they and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the magazine &apos;s issue is a League for itself .
the issue of September is the most popular issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a scope , which resembles a picture volume as a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of advertisers ( L@@ ews Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista , were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the grove ( 6@@ 15 pages advertisement ) .
the unvei@@ ling of his Co@@ ver@@ stars is so ke@@ enly awaited , that in the last two years pictures of the magazine exp@@ ired before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover cover Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celebr@@ ity , &quot; mod@@ alities &quot; as &quot; mod@@ els , the celebrities &quot; on the cover .
Oscar @-@ Pre@@ istr@@ al and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even at the low chance that Ms Jen@@ ner - described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of their generation - under the earlier category it is in good company .
these celebrities are not related to famous individuals or Reality stars or young people today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if everything is true on Jen@@ ner ) .
you are really talented women who are interested in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade , one of the most successful years of their career .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers do not enjoy success any .
with its reality TV , J@@ enn@@ ers was always tense in the fashion world .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleagues in Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and she called her &quot; the pieces of the moment . &quot;
these feelings co@@ ached again as the news with the appear J@@ enn@@ ers emerged on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but it seems to ride along the extreme poverty seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the F@@ gue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jacobs .
it does advertising for your pri@@ mer of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell you pictures of yourself on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
it was sold by her and made images of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the magazine of LOVE .
and in her free time she is seen in the Reality TV . presumably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
municipal authorities account for 160@@ ,000 people per year
more than 16@@ 0.000 of the aid frequencies of the country are rejected annually by the Municipal Auth@@ orities , while the industry is aimed at the impact of further intermediate codes on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Queensland , three out of five persons - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ ons and the like to be rejected at their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ ly explored , make up for further cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of June next year it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the parish church in Que@@ er , James Far@@ rell said , that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Con@@ duc@@ ts appeared to be rejected by thousands of people every year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse without abol@@ ishing the appeal of the German government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Queens@@ lands are chron@@ ically funded , which means thousands of people of important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who rely on violent relationships , people with manage@@ able and op@@ pressive debt , families that were dis@@ missed by separation , workers , the ung@@ ere@@ al code ; all of these people have problems of a legal manner and this collection shows that they may not get the help they need .
the German government will cut the funding by 30 percent as of June 2017 , which means thousands of people to be forced from Queensland to be forced with their legal problems without any assistance .
we demand the General federal law and Federal Minister for federal law as well as sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to in@@ vigor@@ ate these mi@@ ties so that people could get the help they need in legal problems .
last year , the federal government filled its commitment to raise funds for the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the municipal authorities and their local communities , and that the government pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tru@@ mp election campaign was accused of having anticipated weapon
new York : Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign was charged due to alleged in@@ action after you was told that you have directed campaign leader to North Carolina in February , while they were traveling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident was described in a bill that was submitted on Wednesday in the State Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software program for the campaign in this state state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i had been waiting to have been waiting for months to be resolved internally , before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the camp group , Earl Philip , &quot; moved a gun , put his right index on the move , and r@@ ammed the course in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; gave B@@ ordin@@ i in his indictment .
having compl@@ ained on local and regional campaign leader , B@@ ordin@@ i determined that at least four other people had had the same experience with Phillip , he gave in the indictment .
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; gave B@@ ordin@@ i .
the accus@@ ation only falls within two days after the Republi@@ can presidential police officers , when he said a crowd in North Carolina , that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People . &quot; - Sch@@ ro@@ g@@ weapon @-@ owner and weapons @-@ dogs - should take action in case its Ri@@ val@@ ine Hill@@ ary Clinton would be elected and judge .
Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign clearly stated that media had destroyed his words from the context and that he would not be con@@ ta@@ xed to violence .
B@@ ordin@@ is complaint demands claims approach from the campaign for violation of due di@@ ligence and from Philip due to bodily injury and ab@@ iding psychological damage .
Tru@@ mp@@ s Pres@@ ent press Hope Hi@@ cks was not able to achieve an opinion .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey in front of EU elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , there are significant losses for the government &apos;s Parties and CD@@ U .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this has been representative of the public opinion research institution IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; image &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition can still reign in the north , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin .
but in both federal states the SPD would be the strongest party and therefore had good opportunities to continue the government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD @-@ Vorpommern rus@@ hed to 24 percent to 24 percent a five years ago .
the party ar@@ gues therefore only slightly ahead of the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent once more .
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
the Left led by 19 per cent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent in the country for the first time .
the Gre@@ ens are hesit@@ ant despite slight losses with 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) in the European Parliament &apos;s heav@@ y@@ day .
N@@ PD and F@@ PD would not be represented by 3 percent each year .
according to the approval of Berlin in Berlin , the survey of the survey was estimated to only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 2@@ 8,@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent to 2@@ 3.4 per cent .
this makes you even behind the Gre@@ ens using 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but above the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
Af@@ D would be represented by 14 per cent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
at 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would not miss the one in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9@@ 000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in Zeit@@ lu@@ pe : the Nokia communic@@ ator came on the market 20 years ago .
the successor dom@@ inieren today the world - his producer has been living a disaster .
the device vo@@ g nearly half a kilo@@ gram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and bigger , so it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was pretty kno@@ cking .
the built @-@ in memory was at first eight me@@ gab@@ ytes , which would today range for about two r@@ attle with high resolution .
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 Gigab@@ yte .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9@@ 000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came just 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the business - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros , lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet , but they come somehow out of the Stone Age of the Inter@@ nets .
but 20 years ago the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the CeBIT in Hanover as an &quot; office in the West@@ spring format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot : SMS and e @-@ mail could be sent and received by fax , also via fax , the communic@@ ator was able to achieve .
even the access to websites has been possible via HTML @-@ browser , although agon@@ izing gradually .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital addres@@ s@@ book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be worked out similar to a laptop .
then we found a little keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
quite proud was the price : 2@@ 700 D @-@ Mark , that is about 1400 Euro .
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was 2015 at 3@@ 92 Euros .
no one could imagine in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
the cell @-@ austerity of the Finn@@ s lived an unprecedented mis@@ aster , was finally sold to Microsoft and accomplished .
today , suppliers are dominating the market , which all came a lot later than Nokia .
to be online all over the world today , this is a lot of people today for a very large number of people .
in 2015 there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
approximately 1,4 billion devices were sold on Samsung and Apple alone are 5@@ 55 million units .
the global market volume revenues is approximately 400 billion euros .
this includes the well running shops of the countless app suppliers and telecommunications companies .
in the meantime , a whole industry has ar@@ isen around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough for the mass market was launched at the beginning of 2007 , then Apple @-@ boss Steve Jobs announced the launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : one music player , a telephone and an Internet communication , easy to operate via touch screen .
the winner of Apple began , still today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the offspring .
it finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
they now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
in the cut @-@ up today each German now looks 88 times a day on his cell phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn to suggest the smartphone even further , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina ball , Siemens @-@ board responsible for personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , permanent scal@@ ability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must channel the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will take place not only in our local authorities and throughout London , but throughout the country with renewal and prosperity .
for me this was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just as it was in 2012 in London , when we take a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and this will reach how we create new opportunities for local and companies close to He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities , we will be able to create 10,000 new apprentic@@ es@@ hips to create jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; airport &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who think that the challenge of enlargement he@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ aming on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had wrong their case in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles for overcoming , but He@@ a@@ throw answers every asked question .
as the Olympic Games is He@@ a@@ throw for many and not for some an infrastructure project .
enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion to sweat @-@ rate growth and to leave a legacy of skills and jobs both at the airport and in the whole of the UK .
we have launched a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion infrastructure programme , from T@@ 5 - which was selected five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequented cat@@ walks of the world .
now , they are ready to deliver a third run , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
London Olympics Games were a great success for UK and I am confident that the enlargement of He@@ a@@ throw will also be one .
it is time that we will ste@@ er this olymp@@ ic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw and create future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; regarding ad @-@ blocking
for companies that earn money with online promotions , according to one of the software manufacturers trying to get ad @-@ blocking , ad @-@ blocking , a &quot; Kat@@ y and mouse game &quot; alike .
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block ads on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus released a blo@@ gger where it shared that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook revealed that his desktop page would change the coding for his advertisement , in order to detect it adver@@ tis@@ ings the detection on which part of the page advertising is to be difficult to recognize .
but Ad@@ block proclaimed that it has found a new way to byp@@ ass the new codes .
in a blo@@ gger post , the spokes@@ man from Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er battle between the tense open source community and acc@@ esses has already been underway since the invention of scor@@ eboard in progress , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon arrive with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has allowed into battle for social media is a powerful indi@@ z for how worrying ad users have become for industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study conducted over the last year of Pa@@ w@@ air and Adobe about 200 million people , advertisers ; almost four times as much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users , who access Facebook on their mobile devices , hand employs some 84 percent of the advertising revenue of Fac@@ ebooks .
the company has shown it on display blocking on desktop PCs because mobile display blocking no effect on fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and inst@@ agram shared a speaker .
advertising on desktop PCs is making an insufficient increase in revenue , so Facebook will be making the investment of such a step as re@@ warding .
on Tuesday , Facebook revealed that it would be to update his &quot; scor@@ eboard line &quot; to have more control over them .
on Thursday , Facebook asser@@ ted that there are new filters to be worrying about this , because they would also block the content on the page , that no advertising is available .
&quot; for users , this does not represent a positive experience so we plan to address the issue , &quot; said a spokes@@ person of Facebook in an e @-@ mail message .
ad Comple@@ tion are a bl@@ unt explanation , which is why we have concentrated on developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to lay more control over the hands of the people .
women pre@@ tended to transfer su@@ icide to Swiss highway
the sacrifice was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls on witnesses after a woman was transferred on a highway in the early hours of the morning with a suspected su@@ icide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman placed himself in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the street and were taken by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a c@@ rank@@ y at the age of 49 years that was covered by several vehicles , including a truck , who wanted to kill themselves .
she died still on the spot .
several drivers have already heard , but some have still not been identified , the police said these as well as every witness of the incident requ@@ esting it .
a investig@@ ator has been opened , indicating a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter said the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de gene@@ ve .
it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a conflict avoidable ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the pro@@ secutor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held accountable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in each of the two cases - where a person ran on the free@@ way on the free@@ way - was decided that the motor@@ ists don &apos;t need to assume that a pedestrian walk in the night on the highway ran as it was in the newspaper .
last year was a poli@@ cem@@ an of the neg@@ ligence kill@@ ings acqu@@ itted after spending a man and killed , who was in August 2014 one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old sacrifice had drunk and went on the street unconscious , promised the court .
the court revealed that the polic@@ emen had responded to a call -- in an equ@@ itable manner , and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely unusual and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday in Morges , should sign up at the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate @-@ od@@ ell : Venus was once hab@@ itable .
according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model likely to be inhab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of the NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus by using tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble the research by climate resear@@ ches .
the model was designed to determine if the Venus could have been re@@ generated with its hot , waterproof surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once more .
scientists previously pointed out that the slow turning of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , d@@ ined atmosphere and yet slowly moved on .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably proved to be more dry areas than on earth , but had once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and to be protected from rapid dis@@ armament .
the early Venus benefited from a Sun which has 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow turning of Venus started its day of the Sun for almost two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io declared in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , creating a thick layer clouds which seems like an umbrella , to prevent the surface from most of the sun &apos;s warming .
the result are average temperatures , some degree of cool when the Earth today are .
the model brought forth a history of Venus , which resembles the evolution that was previously thought by Plan@@ etary research .
although they used to be inhab@@ itable , the Venus -- in the course of several billions years -- exposed to a lot of heat and ultra @-@ violet light .
her Oc@@ eans dark@@ ened and her water vap@@ or was burned down from the ultra @-@ violet light .
as its hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained behind with a deadly impact -- the Venus that we know today .
the researchers distributed the results of their new Venus Climate Action in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy takes back as a trainer of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy performed back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President Of The Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado University and introduced a small contribution to the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately search for a new trainer .

we all appreciate what he did for our organisation and wish him the best in the future .
Roy has been honoured during his debut season at the Aval@@ ins in 2013 @-@ 14 as the winners of the Jack Adams Awards than the best trainer of the League .
he led the association to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten and missed in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed in each of the last two years .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will hold several full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks to start tackling the problems at the beginning of next year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unions said that their last strike , who is the first in more than 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
wood Group has shortened this year to its contrasts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the evaluation of the company follows a 10 % drop in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company gives the needed space to turn its down@@ turn .
Shell has released thousands of people for thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it ration@@ alized its business activities as a result of its measuring range with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are due to lower crude oil prices under pressure , an economic situation that has reinforced by the decision of the British in June , the European Union .
the Scottish Parliament , Dave Anderson , met with workers &apos; leaders in the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest disputes which has occurred since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 2,@@ 100 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea are expected to have an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures a rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the star @-@ star of the Ple@@ j@@ ades .
the new data can help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars are rotating in the star @-@ pile of different rates as well as in what context are the rotation periods of the planetary development .
&quot; we hope we &apos;ve experienced by the same of our results with other star@@ gates , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ar@@ ed Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light@@ years from the earth .
many stars in this constellation , which emerged from around 125 million years ago , are now reaching the adul@@ thood .
you are now turning the fastest .
at top rates , this str@@ aps star hit large amounts of star@@ ters .
since this winds by the magnet @-@ fields of the stars are travelling , they have an increased effect on the stars .
if a star is alter@@ nat@@ ely , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler is measuring the rotation rate of each star by identifying the time between the appearance of a recognizable star@@ ch -- such as sun@@ spot -- recognize .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates points out that more little stars revol@@ ve slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull is compar@@ es the stars with dancers , where bigger stars are turning slower than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , better at faster rot@@ ors to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades are so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ate qualities as rotation rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offer an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is still much ahead of us to learn more about how the wh@@ e and why stars put their rotation rates down , and so called their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dancing shoes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspapers about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ations of the Ple@@ j@@ ades , who will soon appear in the A@@ stronom@@ ical Journal .
a more cont@@ entious bas@@ eball star
the tears ran before Alex Rodri@@ guez more quickly than the U.S. bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base to Base .
after his emotional set @-@ up announcement , the 41 years old professional will be held on 12 August against the Tamp@@ a Bay R@@ ays a last time the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; Good@@ bye to &quot; the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game participants in the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times , Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable player of the League , 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series .
his signature under a ten @-@ year deal made him a total of 27 million US dollars annually .
until the end of the contrac@@ tion on 31 December 2017 , he will be working in future as a consultant and coach coach .
as a player , Rodri@@ guez won a long time back with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 H@@ its and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; R@@ us &quot; ) for Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es abol@@ ished some milestones .
with the Hall of F@@ ame @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays , just two more bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics show similar values .
but in the glory of the bas@@ eball , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be absorbed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for as successful Rodri@@ guez - nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in the field was , so controversial is its occurrence outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star has already been taken by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , due to a processing in the so @-@ called bio@@ genesis sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 for 211 games .
Rodri@@ guez is considered to be the main susp@@ ects , used for years on an anti @-@ aging clinic in South @-@ Florida Pro@@ mot@@ ing funding .
after a dispute the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favor in 2014 for the year 2014 , because I played through 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez co@@ operated back then . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his farewell days do not go smo@@ ky .
while many bas@@ eball legends are still going on stage in their last games , Rodri@@ guez had to often sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; ätz@@ te Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ guez , who married with the ac@@ tress Cameron Di@@ az married and the circumstances with Pop@@ star Madonna and the ac@@ tress Kate trav@@ eller , sympath@@ ies of the fans of Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Archbishop Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the pend@@ ant at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ guez team .
Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ en@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Go@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
get caught : due to a positive dop@@ ing sample , weight c@@ the@@ bers may not start z@@ hin@@ sky from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing waterfalls .
a wis@@ h@@ ful athlete had won almost a medal .
before the seventh day of the day , the first official dop@@ ing in Rio de Janeiro have been known .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer@@ ing in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meters barriers from Bulgaria and Polish weights ( si@@ z@@ hin@@ sky ) were positively tested and excluded - immediately prior to the beginning of the already crucial athle@@ tics cont@@ ests present this news to the accident .
in Ch@@ en last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de has been demonstrated last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ onry for dop@@ ing instances .
the International Sport@@ geri@@ chtshof CA@@ S confirmed on Friday afternoon at the time of its expulsion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had occupied the fourth place in the finals above 100 m butter@@ fly , only by 0.@@ 09 seconds , she missed the bronze medals .
on Friday Ch@@ en would have to participate in the operations over 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
Ch@@ en has applied for the opening of the B sample and a hearing for the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the National Association take the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and demanded of Ch@@ en &apos;s full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; repeated X@@ in@@ hua from a Communication : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ geri@@ chtshof CA@@ S and will accept the sentence . &quot;
for the first time in history the IO@@ C is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the refurb@@ ishment of athletes with positive cases .
likewise in the night of Rio the news spread over the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old thus went into the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; she told the Bulgarian TV broadcast@@ er B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is inno@@ cent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the athle@@ tic down@@ stream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is expected to act in the bot@@ tled substance to deal with the EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa was suspended temporarily , according to B@@ NT , the B sample should already be positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s prime minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov was promptly dealt with criticism of the Ath@@ ali@@ an Mountains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes do not pull the proper conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians stand under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , about all the weights from the chronic @-@ dop@@ ing nation may not participate in Rio .
on Friday also the case &apos; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &apos; , the London Olympics &apos; was tested in the class up to 85 kg , like its brother Tom@@ as@@ z has had three days before positive on the an@@ abo@@ lic N@@ and@@ lon N@@ and@@ lon .
both are climbing the ing@@ esting , however they must not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athle@@ tics program , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the World Association IA@@ AF had forbidden the entire Russian team up to an exception for systematic dop@@ ing the launch , including the L@@ ant@@ sh@@ nation of Kenya produced in Rio numerous bad news .
in the swimming sport , the earlier forces in China had also taken care of fierce disp@@ arities between the athletes .
so the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t protects the Chinese Olympi@@ asi@@ ger Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ le li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle I want to commit myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun also became the center of an examination of the Australia M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for the dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was tested in 2014 at the Chinese master Championships on the stimulation of the tri@@ met@@ e@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit only a three @-@ month lock .
Data U@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de @-@ black@@ ma@@ ths your ran@@ som
programmer of black@@ mailing lists are currently targe@@ ting companies - and are successful in doing so .
according to a recent survey conducted by Mal@@ ware kit @-@ specialists in Mal@@ p@@ eb@@ ytes , under 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surve@@ yed companies were surve@@ yed at least once , partly several victims of an attack with black@@ smith software .
in Germany almost 20 percent of the companies have already returned to a ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion .
40 percent of the victims are willingly prepared by the perpetrators demanded by the perpetrators of being able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetrators speci@@ alise their black@@ smith software according to the observations of Mal@@ p@@ eb@@ ir@@ ytes on attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to increase ran@@ som is significantly higher than with private users .
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of pollut@@ ant software , &quot; explains Mal@@ p@@ eb@@ ytes , Mar@@ cin C@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
2008 most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were to be sold to commerci@@ als .
then , the perpetrators we discovered black@@ mailing @-@ software for itself .
only a private user took advantage of the target , but the change to company attacks occurred rapidly over the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works for a simple pattern : once on the computer of a sla@@ p , it looks specifically for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ press , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as on archives of pictures and video .
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als .
then the software presents the demands of black@@ mail@@ ers .
in order to get the final turn@@ key code to the files , the victims need money - mostly in the form of cr@@ isp@@ a Bit@@ coin - transfer .
but where in private users the personal photo database is at stake , it is about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly higher the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware suggests .
22 percent of affected German firms negotiated sales losses by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely inter@@ rupt the business operations , in one case people were in their lives .
in Germany several hospitals have been victims of attacks , whose patients may be threatened by loss of sickness ab@@ dic@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say the victims always : do not pay , you just promotes the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data back .
for managers it is difficult to reject the call of perpetr@@ ator from a stand@@ still in the operation .
the h@@ acker in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study the safety investig@@ ator of F @-@ Secure the commercial conqu@@ ests and contact with black@@ mail@@ ers investigated and come to the result : the perpetrators are actually trying to establish a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their sacrific@@ es by chat how they can pay by Bit@@ coin , accessible support websites free or de@@ code files for free example files .
and , private merchants have rede@@ emed by a few hund@@ red@@ th of the euro , businesses must be partly tough and pay five @-@ digit money to retrieve their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively high @-@ risk profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion the h@@ ackers are becoming more and more professional and share the work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the Anti@@ virus provider of Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
probable , however , it is about three or four people .
the programmers sell their pollut@@ ant in the form of a software building on the actual black@@ mailing .
the previous Mal@@ ware kits emerged , using Mal@@ ware himself , consultation and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; included is a custom@@ ization tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ smith will then seek further h@@ ackers in order to dissemin@@ ate the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
you log in one of the forums on the underground , buys the set of a criminal and t@@ asked a further way to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment is made per remaining machine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , the criminals do then carry sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that will ensure their data are better secure .
over 50 percent of company IT officials in the Mal@@ p@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust in order to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware using a file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; if encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful recovery , thre@@ aten the perpetrators instead with the release of sensitive data such as customer list or price lists , &quot; explains Mal@@ p@@ eb@@ ytes , Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
the damage , depending on type of data is still a lot higher than before .
in future , the perpetrators will continue to take entirely new goals on the internet of things in the future .
at the Hack@@ er@@ conference Def@@ con demon@@ te security researchers , as they were able to get with the Internet of inter@@ connected thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of winter the activ@@ ations of such a non @-@ aligned heating could be worth a ran@@ som for so many victims .
if the offen@@ ders then instead of the heating in the future block a whole production road in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware may also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday @-@ friendly
in the little HR @-@ V , Honda will packing everything : a little SU@@ V , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans .
sound pretty much re@@ charging , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although it affects only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V , the passengers have much space in the front row as well as in the rear , it does not work closely at any point .
the materials of the interior are well finished and have a good effect , only the cock@@ pit @-@ top goes there somewhat .
versatile and comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V space .
not only is a trunk of 4@@ 53 l with a high @-@ depth and 10@@ 26 l with a folding back , but there is the &quot; Magic Si@@ ats . &quot;
this is less magical , than it sounds : the seating area of the back bank can be exposed as Kin@@ os@@ es@@ sel and thereby provide storage space , which is from the floor to blankets 1.@@ 24 m high .
the luggage boot is well loaded , however the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1,@@ 6 @-@ l @-@ diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP speeds up the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide @-@ ranges areas very powerful .
however , he is likely to turn his work down somewhat more silent .
grati@@ fying is the everyday usage of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km .
there is still another mot@@ orization : a 1.5 @-@ l petrol engines with 96 kW / 130 HP .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering is likely to be a little more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has no wishes un@@ fulfilled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the security systems the City @-@ Not@@ bre@@ ms@@ ass@@ istent ( works up to pace 32 ) , the collision event system and the gap @-@ resistant .
the coll@@ isions war@@ ner is irrit@@ ated sometimes because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; her@@ pes objects . &quot;
very reliable works the tel@@ esc@@ ope .
and the intelligent temp@@ por@@ e is responding to the traffic den@@ as@@ detection and un@@ le@@ ashed if necessary the speed .
but full connectivity is available only for the top @-@ equipment : 7 @-@ inch Touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and More .
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI switches are under the arm@@ rest and therefore are something awkward .
the around 29@@ ,000 Euros for the well equipped top diesel are decent .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline from 200@@ 00 euro , the diesel starting from 2@@ 3000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro @-@ 6 emissions standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday @-@ rated car .
Air@@ line is not liable : down@@ fall to aerial Bridge
an air@@ line is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
because a liability is conceivable only in danger that are typical of air traffic , the Supreme Court held in Düsseldorf ( AZ , 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken down in the down@@ fall of a knee br@@ ace .
however , the accident could have felt everywhere - it is a general risk of life , so the court .
the carrier had no damage to the man .
disease case : when paid the supplier
of course , vac@@ ation@@ ers get back after their trip only money if the cause of the disease is doub@@ t@@ ful in the hotel .
this is only the case , if more than ten percent of the guests have proven the same symptoms show .
in this case , a family had fallen ill on the second day of her tur@@ k@@ ah heavy to diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting .
she almost spent the entire holiday in the room .
their disease led the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a def@@ ective se@@ wage water that supposedly poll@@ uted to sea water .
the family had the view that the journey was a lack of time - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ ers .
on trial the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had no success .
indeed , the se@@ wage situation was indeed def@@ ective .
but the promot@@ er took only briefly before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff .
he had to assume until then that the sea@@ water was fine .
he did not hurt his information duties , so the judgement .
especially since in the rehear@@ s@@ als of water no pollution have been found .
the disorder of several hotel guests - possibly through infection with each other - belonging to the general risk of life .
between 6@@ 91 guests only 38 got fallen .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , after the violence perpetr@@ ated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people could have worried about their attacks .
the state must be rash and decided to respond to terror at the same time .
surely it is : our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hate and split .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this triumph we will not treat the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if offen@@ ders need to leave the country more quickly , but increase security and increase the approval of the population for the refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère plans to implement the proposals until the Bundest@@ ags of 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personal rein@@ forcement of security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in medium @-@ first scale over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must be back under punishment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance is to be improved , so that weapons will be seized so much above all the purchase of weapons on the internet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last much discussed welding for physicians should be uph@@ eld by de Mai@@ zi@@ ères .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solutions , as the threat of citizens can be reduced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said with regard to mental symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to counter the radic@@ alization of refugees the Minister maintains a better social care .
teachers would have to be better prepared to deal with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
for the persecution of criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning to be used to be used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD boss Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to improve security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister of Interior spoke openly against action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a ear@@ rings for the hing@@ es in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gabriel the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union after a bur@@ ka ban and abol@@ ish the double citizenship previously .
a generic ban on whol@@ em@@ itting it can be problematic for constitu@@ tionally .
one can &apos;t stop anything which one re@@ jects , and I reject the wearing of the Bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses on court .
green @-@ Che@@ fin Simone Peter cast the Minister before , he wants to sim@@ ulate with an ever new anti @-@ terror of energy and action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the left @-@ hand of Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet of spra@@ ying and a tigh@@ tening of the residence to the right will no longer bring people in this country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway junction
it looks at regular on the road @-@ road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the rule of law shall be extended .
this is good news for all motor@@ cyclists who travel in the professional traffic on the ambient road every night in St@@ au , when they drive over the highway &apos; Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road building is extended to the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) within the area between the hammer Street and the downhill Fle@@ eler road , at 700 meters .
motor@@ ists can then enter right by the hammer street on the right .
the big advantage : the traffic will share early detection , whereby the total length of course on the busy section of the federal road 51 will be improved .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the train station on the train station is nervous the motor@@ ists especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days from back to the bridge over the Alber@@ go trail and sometimes in addition .
reason is the needle on the B 51 shortly before the departure of Wes@@ er Straße .
from here the traffic will be guided only one lane in the motorway .
the second track had to be built in a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations were revealed that the bridge could no longer have the required hydro@@ power to di@@ fy chie@@ fly the heavy @-@ proof traffic .
how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ pass and the associated rod will last , the state authority can &apos;t say .
however , it is expected to be reck@@ oned with years : for the bridge has an official resi@@ dual duration from the year 20@@ 34 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the extension of the rule of law , the country deliberately picked up the busi@@ est time during the school holidays , because with disabilities to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
traffic will be guided on Tuesday and on Wednesday one lane from the site .
intercultural journey : cultural offers for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theater piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater now plan a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has a presentation of the award @-@ winning denom@@ inations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Young Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the context of the &quot; cultural journey from the association N@@ ima &apos;s , &quot; cross @-@ cultural journey &quot; visited 19 students between 11 and 15 years of staging in the little house .
since the beginning of the year , the association , the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , has set the opportunity to visit schools with welcome classes as part of the project cultural institutions in Münster .
most young people in the class were between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster , and a little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the s@@ zen@@ ische images and video anim@@ ations , it may have been possible to follow the course of action , thus the press release of the Young Theatre Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr Tann@@ az Al@@ ter@@ berg from spra@@ ying , and the Young Theatre will work together in the upcoming season as part of a musical the@@ ater@@ al project .
from October to December youths with and without air and migration background between 14 and 20 years are meant to have the opportunity to visit professionally guided courses in singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the area of theatri@@ cal and theatri@@ cal language services are planning .
the project &quot; intercultural journey &quot; continues .
given the increasing number of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate .
rain instead of star@@ ry : hope for weather repair
the weather has made the star s@@ nap Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany at night for Friday a d@@ ash by the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was badly suited for clouds and rain to observe the cel@@ estial spectacle , the Chairman of the observatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , am Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather is meant to be good , then we certainly see many star @-@ holes in the sky .
the clusters are about Per@@ sei@@ den , which belong to the fastest growing star with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they seem to come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which is in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping @-@ dys@@ functions
having rolled yourself around , in the evening you are awake , at night one is awake and awake in the morning is far from the W@@ ec@@ ker@@ ck@@ ling no longer to think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one has been in good company with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch @-@ Institute about a quarter of adults sleep @-@ disorders and more than ten per cent have often experience their sleep frequently or permanently rather than rest@@ or@@ ative .
how are sleeping problems or in@@ mates ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be diverse causes behind them , highlighted Hans @-@ Günter We@@ bern , board member of the German Society for Sle@@ eping Research and Sle@@ eping Medicine .
what you understand , it is the In@@ som@@ nia , thus a inhal@@ ation and mi@@ dd@@ ly disorder .
just that far many people feel as uns@@ atis@@ fying or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , a member of the German household association with practice in the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it , organic , mental or mal@@ nour@@ ishment factors may be stuck , but also medicines stuck .
not rarely is the sleeping @-@ compul@@ sive expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early waking up is often common in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ e@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors lead to each other .
those who for example has a disc@@ ard drop , can be bad , watches all two to three hours and perhaps starts to p@@ itting on everyday problems and worry , there are wo@@ e@@ articles an example .
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when you should be with sleeping disorders , to the doctor ?
who is not well sleeps about a month of one month in at least three nights per week and is com@@ promised by the day , should go to the medical doctor .
the impair@@ ment can look completely different : one is dis@@ beaten , tired , in@@ out sleeping , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has m@@ oods or physical discomfort such as stomach or head@@ ache .
in order to relie@@ ve the sleep @-@ compul@@ sive disorder , it is important to find their causes .
as a treatment options , inter alia , behavi@@ oral patterns , a cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even medicines - classic sleeping @-@ coated tablets are only applicable for a minimum of two weeks .
low @-@ time dormit@@ ory is barely mentioned in Germany , empha@@ sizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore , one should address in sleeping problems at first at the home doctor , betra@@ ys gre@@ ets .
this can be clarified with studies , whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should do in sleep , and what happens ?
for examination in the sleeping laboratory , medicine is used for example in snoring with breathing difficulty , in case of disease fatigue or if one does not find the cause of a sle@@ ep@@ y disorder , explains Fi@@ etze .
this is not necessary to prepare for the study .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only please do not make a nap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after bon@@ ding , you go to bed at his normal time .
besides the electro@@ des in the body you carry a nose @-@ she@@ ath , a chest strap , and a anten@@ na@@ e at the finger .
in addition , a camera records the ceiling the dor@@ ms .
how can people cope with the problems ?
there are quite a lot of pitches on which one can sit for a better sleep .
We@@ e@@ ets is counted towards : regular bed@@ time and performances , not too long in bed , on the day not sleep , do not watch TV for sleeping , alcohol , and at night doesn &apos;t start to look at the clock - then you start right immediately , and this is quite and not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has
the former German swi@@ mmer Mark D@@ ei@@ bler expressed himself by Facebook to dis@@ appoint the DS@@ V teams at Olymp@@ us .
in December 2014 he brought gold @-@ master@@ ed for the first time in December 2014 and presented his first world record at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler available on Facebook protected against his in criticism of the Ex @-@ team @-@ team .
&quot; in a country where a Olympics is € 20,000 premium and a citizen of 150@@ ,000 € should not be surprised about missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night on his fac@@ ebook @-@ page .
the conveyor system in swimming sport is poor , the dop@@ ing checks on the other hand very well .
this allows us to compete with countries that promote a lot and do not even see it in the topic of dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be set , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to launch a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler would have to sign up nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Deutschland ( Nada ) .
this is how you should keep it with countries too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who cannot be controlled a certain time before World Cup / OS of independent controllers of W@@ ada / F@@ ina , must not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demands the choice of bur@@ gers who now operates a ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : ban@@ anas of baggage arrest
professional Die@@ be at the Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil courts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police took the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the susp@@ ects had committed to the ban@@ qu@@ ets and luggage ste@@ els .
at 21.@@ 30 pm civil civil servants in the area of the airport Düsseldorf was a gang back that was known to the polic@@ emen of last theft .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July and were in a collaborative , collaborative and particularly professional .
the specialists of the crime syndic@@ ate 34 can identify the th@@ ie@@ ves , who have travelled to Germany for the protection of criminal off@@ ences towards Germany , four deeds .
they had a total of over 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , a few lime trees , in the meantime the remainder of the cob@@ bl@@ estones : the Riga Street in Berlin @-@ Friedri@@ ch@@ sha@@ in appears at first sight not so , but the police are one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
when one walks along the road from east to west , one arrives at playing places , a fresh@@ est kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade .
the facade of a gray house has someone &quot; ugly ! &quot; pro@@ ver@@ sive .
towards a Li@@ d@@ l , which should also be demol@@ ished soon , is already built : up to 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new flat rentals .
article about this &quot; trendy neighbourhood , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedri@@ ch@@ sha@@ in calls , but in recent weeks , pre@@ fers with burning cars .
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile , the residents have rented contracts , but on the ground floor there are still spaces occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin Dom@@ sen@@ ator Hen@@ kel had spoken many times for a hard approach to the police against the project , the region called &quot; no @-@ go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point for autonomous violence .
after June 22nd , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmie@@ de , with 300 police officers , were pat@@ rolling over the police for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three teams cars on the ground , bar@@ red parts of the road and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , construction workers on behalf of the unknown home owner the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin administrative district decided that the clear@@ ance had been illegal , and a day later , police and builders took place under the ju@@ bel of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street is peaceful : parents are going to walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking pre@@ m Sp@@ ä@@ ti .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects are primary school and kinder@@ gartens .
lef@@ tist violence is not the main inhabitants of many inhabitants : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives since 1999 in the jaw , and Jan@@ a * , which pul@@ ls only three children , primarily by the police site .
with the inhabitants of the house @-@ projects , they share their concern with increasing rents and v@@ entri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a max@@ z , who wish to feel mostly political protection from v@@ and@@ ali@@ on Left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin cour@@ tro@@ ator and the police force between the occupied and their neighbours , does not exist as obviously .
Friedri@@ ch@@ sha@@ king in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working quarter , which is also a low average age in comparison to the rest of the city and has high poverty @-@ risk .
also the capacity and the native living projects are already a long time ago : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former DDR , including nearly the entire Main@@ zer street , very close to the Riga .
while the Main@@ zer had been evacu@@ ated under a large police battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga and were still inhabited by people who occupied it for 26 years ago .
at the same time , the city district has become increasingly becoming a magnet for tourists and electoral liner from all over the world : with them now people live from the GDR &apos;s times and former house occupied their p@@ ines .
this also shows itself with the rents that have risen by nearly 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes them on sli@@ pped discs or fresh coated fac@@ ades , which were tos@@ sed with color .
no other road has been mentioned so often along with the words &quot; lef@@ tist violence . &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours look at it as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : criminal crimes , such as bodily injury do not affect almost exclusively against poli@@ cem@@ an .
the majority of the Cri@@ mes make Sach@@ sh@@ out , which tends to make the newly built and newly renovated houses more recently .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives for 17 years in a ten@@ ement house beside the controversial 94 , the insecurity could not be a speech .
as for violence , it is relevant : people in 94 are their neighbours who have not been determined .
there were no longer the famous burning cars in the Rig@@ s anymore .
for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more of one another , than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been deliberately drawn into the Riga Street - and remained .
that &apos;s why it was so important to her that the inhabitants took their streets away : from the police , politics and the media , who suddenly inv@@ ests a clarity about the city in July .
but in the eyes of women as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : by clear new buildings in former building blocks , which sup@@ press the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are ultimately property flats , which are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so good &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction can I be absolutely not appro@@ ving . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should one do , if any one never ends ?
on all sides frustration , also with the police and the inhabitants .
for the zo@@ omed , that gri@@ eves over color bom@@ bers , Ker@@ stin has a little understanding : the house @-@ projects and the left scene belonged to the jaw .
who comes close , should be aware - just like someone who moves to a pub that can complain poorly about noise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all persons named with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first @-@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked do not have asked to be called with their correct name &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ g@@ le is a new refugees
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ g@@ le is the contact person in the field of integration and organizer .
furthermore , it is social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ter@@ le has been the refugees commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach .
the social educ@@ ator supports the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it sees itself as a contact for all stakeholders : refugees , labor market refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else is still ming@@ led .
Reg@@ ine customer from the circuit board indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ s@@ le is now there , the hur@@ dle W@@ oll@@ ram@@ ch@@ sau , which above all have a problem .
as a result , some - less spot@@ ted than intended in the variety of areas of task - meant as the administration wanted to write the place .
he was looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , connected with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just a hur@@ ting wool .
however , administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ s@@ le .
above all , it is about organization , work with local people and also behind the scenes and power supply .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been with me for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent spot on three years with the possibility of extension .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le ehr@@ er and full @-@ time actors are supported .
there are big and small problems , organisational , human and legal problems .
soon new containers are available in the washing road
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a serious problem has been to be found for some time , apartments for the connection &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; connection &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which have been recognized . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the connection supply , the municipalities are responsible .
they have to place the refugees in their own or rented housing rooms .
the cost of construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the government council at commune and job center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search for some time has been very difficult .
de facto the management does not find private apartments .
it doesn &apos;t work so far that you should be reli@@ ant on private flats , so Deu@@ ter@@ le .
therefore , the flats must be considered as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers are set up in the washing road .
but only with apartments is not done .
perspective is the word , Reg@@ ine Customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ li@@ le agree .
alongside a solid base , there are tra@@ des@@ hips , training places , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and tut@@ oring for refugees and migrants that have to be fled or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; report Reg@@ ine Customer .
many works in the building yard or help house@@ master , do non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ s@@ le .
she hopes that work for the community being in a positive effect .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day will need a fixed structure , say Deu@@ li@@ le and Customer .
people would have to develop a lack of confidence .
so do you need offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so you can also jump here administration and volunteers .
it &apos;s central that the refugees got the feeling they were welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they need to explain the refugees that it takes and they can survive the time conveniently , for example with language courses .
who will eventually develop the feeling he could not help in Ur@@ bach , should not work and be un@@ selfish , that will never be integrated .
the distinct majority may be motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are also problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says customer honestly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people where nothing is about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ s@@ le and customer is therefore always to motivate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all this was already a &quot; Mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : do the two of the recent incidents fear of radic@@ alization , also in a small community such as Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some na@@ ï@@ ve call it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; a re @-@ risk can and would not exclude it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sensi@@ ti@@ zed are the hel@@ pers already .
the incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the attacks bring them entirely in recall .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer .
many of them would love to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so , main and volunteer will have to hold on site and in the region to work out .
they have always in the background that soon a new pile of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a limit ?
this question clearly to answer , h@@ ein@@ ate the policy .
actually it is unfair to put hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach , we have not yet arrived where we want , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ s@@ le .
no new refugees , this would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine Customer also makes it clear that Ur@@ bacher is already busy already to integrate the previous people .
these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political situation is so complicated , since there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : natives with helicopter .
the police helicopter flew approximately one hour long different areas - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are for@@ ged into an apartment in an apartment house in Lin@@ den@@ weg on Friday morning .
the inhabitants surprised the two and sm@@ ote the bump@@ y in the escape .
the two men were at about 1.@@ 65 to 1,@@ 70 meters in large , well mass@@ aged , wearing both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black cap@@ u@@ zen@@ pul@@ lis .
you are looking for the city center .
for the decision , the police took a number of strikes , as well as a police helicopter .
the decision was running without success .
maybe the un@@ know@@ able before the apartment fell near the apartment or in their flight .
