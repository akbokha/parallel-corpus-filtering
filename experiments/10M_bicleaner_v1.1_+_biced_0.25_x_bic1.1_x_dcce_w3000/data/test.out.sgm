<seg id="1">Clin's and Trumps Policy in comparison: IT's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential competitors, however, are in control and energy policy as well as in a basic demand.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">Who, about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep that in doubt rather small and warns against how the state of economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton plans to put the economy to death and adjust to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">In contrast, he himself would be quite different, maintains Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will make regulations massive, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower taxes - for both individuals and companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton said: the state has appointed certain duties to open, he has given rise to power and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, the taxes would increase to the rich, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In that time, Trump and Clinton have to be invested almost.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly denied by the state-critical Teasy-wing of the republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump there could be no internal discussions yet.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal power stations and rebuild coherent production in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production is intended to be possible in so far-protected areas to announce the Paris climate protection agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton is intent on expanding renewable energies with their investment programme and demands:" "" "a country will create the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements, the two rivals are not too far away.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazific trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">But at the same time, both of them want the US to isolate not from international trade - but just to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">And they should then be better paid for example, calls for example Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The present minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it up to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump does not want to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to go, then he says he should not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the next few months is likely to be more likely to develop the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "on the one hand is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics point to him, that the budgetary deficit only would make even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who at least demand from the rich, want to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Russia and Turkey: an" "" "Alliance of external sides" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended up a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterparts in the gold-plated hall of the St. Peter's palace in reception, I cannot fend with the expression that Ankara wants that reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handle, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile was driven narrow and he hardly was able to heat from, even for his backward conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report all five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I could no longer count.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old levels before the crisis, but can even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved so badly as if it were never a worst thing.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me to suggest the opposite rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin-radiant, sustainable cool was that the President of Russia had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his performance: the plane of a Russian struggle to the Syrian border by Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow has been walled by Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara to please Russia into the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The failure was even bigger, as it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Vetoes restore it becomes difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months the state-controlled media introduced a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed that the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most seriously, the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family from illegal oil trading in Syria could have benefited from the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has disputed this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received an excuse by the President Erdogan, who he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the advantages of a cease-fire is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan primarily needs all friends, who he can get, after the last month after a failed coup d "état almost his office.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey tough - in particular the prohibition of charter flights, which usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when flights are recorded.</seg>
<seg id="33">You count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week foreclosed the televised televised fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agriculture could be re-imported.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedesti deformed it to: "tourists staying there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious to the West as it was in response to the tried to be a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "to this end, the ongoing Groll about the snow-emptlement of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pious to take advantage of the cool atmosphere and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">Russian president in Ankara won't win a bonus in Ankara that after the attempted coup, I demanded support for the elected state institutions.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well-evident for Moscow, it is a matter of fact that even a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "the summit in this glorious palace by the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to portray" "" "Alliance of outsiders" "", "two countries which violates themselves from the West and treated badly and now behaved." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Yet, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "the biggest difference between Syria, where Moscow has recently been the role of a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support conflicting sides." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">It could signify that after nearly three hours of initial conversations, both presidents on the press conference said that they didn't even realise the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey deliberately abandoned it to reply to a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize it.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO joins the Russian battle, it is certainly better that the two heads of state should speak at least one another.</seg>

<seg id="2">Dettori spelt champagne after a double at Nevmarket who brings about 3,000th profit to him</seg>
<seg id="3">The Jockey Frankie Dettori ensured his 3.000th British profit on Friday at Newmarket.</seg>
<seg id="4">He continued on Predilection, which was trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win the night a milestone.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey, reaching the milestone in the flat race.</seg>
<seg id="6">He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester piglet, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.</seg>
<seg id="7">The dreiment winner of Dettori, who did previously on Ghayyar said, "It is something special."</seg>
<seg id="8">I am very emotional, because my family is here too</seg>
<seg id="9">I am very happy about the fact that it's happening in Newmarket because I am 30 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is not a big meeting; it is not Royal Ascot - it is a mundane Friday evening with 20,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I am relieved and very modest.</seg>
<seg id="12">Dettori takes the juble when he gets the victory at Predilection</seg>
<seg id="13">Two Jockeys achieved the milestone in the obstacles - Jockey Richard Johnson and the pensioned 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who finished more than 4,300 victories in a real-time career.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lester Pigdevt, the ninth time DerbyWinner had 4,493 careers.</seg>
<seg id="15">Frankie is one of the best jockey on the modern age and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone so far only a few in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="16">It has style and is strong, but he is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.</seg>
<seg id="17">He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma enthusiastic fans for years for this sport.</seg>
<seg id="18">I said Frankie some weeks ago at Epsom that he would have collected 6,000 winnings if he wasn't just a weekend and Großturnierjockey!</seg>
<seg id="19">Frankie has rained around 30 years of winning in the UK, which is great.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has a vivid personality, which is good for a british race, but in addition he is an incredible jockey.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount</seg>
<seg id="22">From flying finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the embodiment of British flap for two decades.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was nerve-wracking.</seg>
<seg id="24">A whole bunch of big players, including his famous "glorious seven" in 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash, and received a drug ban.</seg>
<seg id="25">Three years ago, he had difficulty at first, when he returned from six months, but he showed an impressive formal strength to defy its branches and to return to its bribery.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia President Putin feudchief, Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">The Russian President Vladimir Putin has released unexpectedly on his staff leader Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was a lot of years part of the closest confidence circle by Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed special officer for environmental and transport affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "in an opinion of the Kremlin it is that Putin without giving reasons" "" "Ivanov has placed his duties as president of the Russian Presidential government." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was named to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned state of Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the message in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website it is called "Russian), that he later was on the Chief of Chief of the governing council and the executive director of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">About his appointment he said to Putin: "thanks for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the main task of the government to promote your work as a head of legislation on legislative bodies and inspections to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV broadcaster on Friday, Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time of one of the closest associate Vladimir Putin and works like it for Soviet secret service, KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a staff member, he was one of the most powerful men of the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">During a meeting with President Putin that was broadcasted on television, both men declared that staff will leave his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smiles for the cameras, there are only a few of it - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is there the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">This is currently no one knows.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who was once addressed as potential President suddenly would be based on Russian environmental policies - came across huge scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, who is quoted on the website of the Kremlin, Ivanov said, "It is true that I had asked you early 2012 in a conversation, giving me this very complicated post - you could almost say - difficult post for four years to be placed.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential office for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Prior to before, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council, and as Putin's former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who deployed the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia for Putin's second term as a third presidential term of Putin could violate the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, closest allies of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president for three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="17">When implemented, this will be implemented for additional tasks in the construction administration.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness, that is worth</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and child are no longer going out for playing out, but rather prefer to spend their free time gazing while working on screens, has been complained about many.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and make more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited on TV, then on video games and finally on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters, initially created for the video games in the 1990 ′ s (later a drawing series, game cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many phenomena of the pop culture, the interest of the game sank in the US, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was moved by massive demand that overloaded the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within days Pokémon Go more users had as Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go out with their smartphone and look for Pokémons that will be followed by a GPS if they were found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation which played the game when she was younger, closed the pahn and jumped on the couch from the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the US the game has led to a considerable rise in increments that puts the" "" "average" "" "person every day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, tracked 35.000 users recently, the Washington Post recently shared that within two days of launch of the game, the number of people followed, which sprang up every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it just looks the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns to health, people want to" "" "take 30 minutes" "" "to be active" "" "out of the sofa" "", "because many public messages are boring to health and come to people who are miserable." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the meaning of sport can not be overevaluated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who drives regularly to sport, reduces its chances to become contaminated with cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is, that it brings people to do something outside, that they enjoy fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, there are three pillars of health covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people are even closing new friendships in the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are crush problems, who have to always complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could go against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it to be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has taken a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like FitBit had previously been able to track our activity, they gave us no reason to exercise sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will be after the time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, on the basis of Pokemons's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and helping many people in hunting, more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I present to me under the women's pregnancy and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been in each summer months since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three turbines, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, inspired by many young girls of other colored skin.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew is and Madison Kocian, the Catholics, turns every day off.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one was one of the female Turnerers an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year were Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising olympic winning player in America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world championship in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, how they expected unexpected, but mastered gymastic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won the gold medal at an individual Severe event.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but we do not see sport classes all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie sms all the same route as Aly and Madison, to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "last Five" because the next Olympics will only have four Turnerers in the crew. besides, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality tells that Turning is a more expensive sport and Turner is primarily granted in private gymnasium, which can be maintained by parents for training, furnishing, travel and Hoteles (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turnaround lie in affluent suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these verses the Turner get their entire training and that is a expensive and long-term commitment to families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer by Laurie Hernandez, have trained both their athletes, since they started with the tower.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to get inspired to the churches aun innumerable, young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a high-performance and easy-to-reach turnaround.</seg>
<seg id="23">I was founded my turnaround for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">In my events we have provided free and affordable turbines in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international victors.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality turbines that earn the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turnen develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team to bring thousands of young girls to care for the sounds and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in the sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of "Girl Power" by the Holen des Olympic Manning, and thanks, Fass her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked with Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Verbandes in New York to find out how to get around with armed robbers on the close distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you approach you from the front or behind you, this video will show you how you shoot the mirror for your robbers.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you sow them from behind, then you should turn out to be one, so you can see your attacker and move out of the line, "says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Seize the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you face it with your free elbow to your face.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hit him then with his knee in the bar and rotate, while the attacker fights against pain, the weapon from his hands. hit him with the run and move backwards while they turn the weapon to him.</seg>
<seg id="8">With attackers, which approach from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line, grab the gun and rotate it, so the Attacker can't shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Shifting the weight on the gun at the same time and hit the attacker onto the chest, then turn the gun from his grip before they move backwards and turn the weapon to it.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller moved its immune system and worefeflex a serious test - by scout some of the dirty and dirty places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk cut off his course on a Euro-Schein, a railroad on Piccadilly Circus, a flush knob of a migratory burdock, as well as a public telephone in Russia in order to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of the derivation of each object he used a Luminaire to show himself and us to what he is going to get into.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filtered under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought, the rinsing knob of a migratory burdock, which was already used by thousands of others, may be totally repulsive, but actually inside a kitchen sink more poor bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals concerning the support of bowel bacteria as well as his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately he left nothing, which he stretched out, more than a bad night taste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of his intestine by looking through the world and ate beautiful things, as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public places in stations to train stations to rinsure toilets, the task subjected its immune system definitely under one sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told me: "already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and slaughtering water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was able to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused, was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His probationary did show a Luminometers from over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the Luminomdometer is freshly washed out of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to disguise after her Luminometers over 4000 units were, while fresh-rued hands become one of less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel-off "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial number in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "it comes to the worst thing that I have found in a restroom" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing distracted as that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not touch here anything, because it is dirty here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Company is equipping Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both Milk-bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of bowel bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer the consumer something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explained the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We did crazy Brainstormings that did so that we said "Lass to call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of just talking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary, we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "Tom Hakala, who led the Director of the film, added:" "" "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he would ignite some of the things I instructed him to learn, just like the ecclassy Russian toilet that is shown in the film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course, there were things in which it was easier to put Ian Gillan, to lick it and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I am glad we have recorded some of these dirty goodies." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In one of the survey conducted in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents carried out milk-acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of the stomach and the intestine and 58 percent, they said that they are at least occasionally present products containing attached milk-acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>

<seg id="7">The jobsite could be relocated to the south on the weekly basis as scheduled after the end of October, until the end of October everything should be ready.</seg>
<seg id="8">Also the opposing of construction is also praised for the construction work, e.g. when it comes to setting up accommodation cruises.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site on Monday emigrated to the South and also the blockage of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has been lifted, and thus also the connection to Rottenburg is rebuilt, the traffic situation in the place has eased.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive from Ofterchelinki from the B 27 again.</seg>

<seg id="25">And for a number of points - in the unequal treatment of opponents - the question arises: what does this have to do with certainty and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.</seg>

<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, after China the second most important market, sales were 14 per cent below the prior-year figure.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the home market, Germany dodates the output to almost a sixth of the sixth.</seg>
<seg id="11">Trademarks President Jürgen Stackmann stressed the weaker figures from July above all on two sales days less in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, it has given back a department back to some core markets due to "changed economic conditions."</seg>

<seg id="16">Overall, the mainly affected person in Niedersachsen is already further plainly ruled by the diesel scandal: after the first seven months only an extradition minus of 0.9 percent is reached to 3,37 million vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="17">Group leader Fred Kappler obtained a sales splitting from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time, 5,904 million in this time.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had manipulated with a software host test.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW is calling for approximately 2.5 million car rearmament to the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of rearmament reiterated VW, that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="22">After rearmament of the vehicles there are no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions, or motor-performance.</seg>
<seg id="23">The carbureau to the customer after rearmament is a "guaranteed" certificate, but I am not talking about a "guarantee" as it was on Friday in the company.</seg>

<seg id="28">"" "" "" "VW has fully defined the limits of my investigation commission and the full of KBA." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">"derogations of this are not accepted," stated Federal Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the ministry.</seg>
<seg id="30">VW has assumed the guarantee that in case of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motorcycle output after rearmament are no deteriorations and all type-related vehicle values remain unchanged.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who does buy record-plates?</seg>
<seg id="2">Emptful men of middle age love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you join the commentary box, to litter it under the alias non-single men's loosing age with rough insults, this statement derives from actual data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the diverse vocalist of vinyl records does not want to have a boom in millennials that want to greet the news of physical objects but to midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently purchased a record are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a horror by Hobbycollectors - it has an emotional meaning: older records reserve their feelings far for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But agree the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news clip in television, I would follow the camera, while I walk in a busy road in Soho, a modest gray dress and wild contented before I steal, my hands and something determining how: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of Soya slowly gains its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now fill the buildings where once independent salesmen were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera to the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to evaluate their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I received from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle ages) into the Recess Records (data number: eight men middle age, a woman, probably about 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and walks through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These soundboards, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by E-Mail, I have not followed it at home), dress the walls of his room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records which he could not afford to buy and re-buy objects he sold, when he was young and pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60ies, early 70s which appeared as I was 11 or 12. things when I was probably too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I drink not very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works in Sister Ray, believes also that many customers that he meets to apply for the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">It also has noticed a new wave of people who will be influenced by the Mediterpe, people who have heard about the comeback and put on to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">With the conversations I have led, people usually have been drained around 1998 or 1999 in their collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers that were once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to get back their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom in the trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica, to realize that record stores a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ some of the older customers were killed on the non-contact payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw themselves to the stability of familiar sound plattening envelopes, of items, the happy Yugenderings.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or possession of material possessions than being a kind of comfort," says NEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as a collectors, and I think it is like many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to relate to spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "flare a staff from a record stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April uncovered that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month they have not heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey was also found that 41% possess a turntable which they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, no turntables have.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned while being petrified by stacks of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, of the sounds of the Universe (number of data: three men middle age) has been working, has noticed a "trophy aspect" of Revivals.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone recently came here purely and said," "" "I do not own a turntable, but I would like to buy a radio top record, so I can put them to the shelf," "" "says he." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a great percentage but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-lashing, less music clasp.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say:" "" "I have no turntable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones who are only slowly coming.</seg>
<seg id="44">Flop, which devoted the record plates to almost a whole floor, has a blower audience, when I go away.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenager and women aged.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts newester synthesizers and sexigrilled Pop instead of experimental jazz, pulling from the speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks lonely, but wet mental traumas are hard to determine if you stand next to someone 30 seconds long.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for a couple of minutes and considers the variations of the panels for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window-roll than a big purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not deserve much, so the collection of plates is not a real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It will cost a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to hear music from one computer or in another way, but the beauty of records is... "she drives with a loved sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it is truly unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop that is said to have inspired a new generation of style lovers: urban outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">As I give the semblance of mug the jeans hotter, I've grouped a group of young teenage girls, who group for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter remember to buy a crosley turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a stairwell, a wall full of records from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "no one looks like it - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it's impossible to put it up." ""</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that each attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It's no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, also the one that is closest to luxury items as drives.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research were revealed that the results from YouGov devotes, at least in record business in Soho, the huge number of female collectors, who exist in reality, record business and in online fores.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday tomorrow with safety not with strolling through records of the Berwick Street and the leaf through plates, while they envy the starving view of an uncanny, 30-year-old moderator that protrudes over the shoulders of the middle aged.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at 7-er Rugby came to a abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were defeated by a result of 43-7 in the defensive stage here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji granted a master class in handling, side-Stepping, pitting, line-up and crude force to gain gold - its first Olympiad of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was won by the not too bad trophy of the silver medal - Great Britain in this day - and they were certainly proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they proposed New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the ram, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could be dropped off in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But irrespective of this, Fiji on this form could have taken a 15-man team in order.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a comfort for UK - but will it probably not - that at least a Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal to hang his neck: Fijis Cheftrainer Ben Ryan, the former head for England in Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind them.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago it was lost among Ryan of every game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This slidesis going to weep, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began to be released and caused the attacks to GBs out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt like captain Tom Mitchell and Co. in the running running. the World Series players went out 5-0 upwards, when Osea Kolinisau went in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With just four minutes of playing time Jerry Tuwai yet another attack from the right corner, which he changed.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely captured the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hevoringly tone of Mitchell put the mountain from Sierra Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third goal, but Fiji just stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua will be a touch-down in the right corner and there was 0-17 for the UK.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa has added a new since the refiff and it still has a minute of playing... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou preside through further weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed down to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while the UK is still over.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB triggered basic changes to half-time and closed the fijilian gap... for all four minutes, what was good for the circumstances of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova resran into a brilliant lucplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched a try for the UK, made a Touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game ran for a long time in favor of the southern sights, whose fans sessed, flags smiled and danced on the bleachers.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Vilizer put the i-icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Pfiff protrute, the fijis embraced and GB-plated nickel-plated in the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier in the day Fiji Japan had defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Britain squeezed South Africa in a scarce semifinalmatch from the race - Great Britain conversion to the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the boat in the first half to front, but Dan Norton broke down the line with an impressive legwork and scored a gate among the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late-winner of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-seaside team, secured the prize - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="4">Even if there were only the two of those who were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the Echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was all present when she turned the first women in the history of British Sports, who laid on such a scale.</seg>

<seg id="6">What we are seeing are two brilliant athlete who glides over the surface with the elegance of sponge, which does not reflect the nature of the Triomphe, which is not reflected.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing there is a battalion to willy helpers who make the difference and it was not an assistant director than the coach, who did not survive the day 30 months ago, if he was diagnosed with him cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer who is operable and they did so.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not, he spreads throughout.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio had luck that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, could start out what the interruption occurred to a minimum, in case those under such circumstances is the correct term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to get it better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet, 30 foot, 50 feet to a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the inmediating of victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a very beginning morning a little more than usual and tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Panning, which was as Hauptmann in the Royal Arllery regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, "I was this week an emotional Wrack. that's maybe something extremely, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It repeatedly stimulates how much I have worked, how much I and Helen and also the Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, therefore a massive thanks to him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat tells that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is unsensitizing towards races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtering tool, snapchat will allow about 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identities in such a way that borders the Absurde.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure, which could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are non-blooded, independent tools, which more than 30 million improved selfishers per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All missteps will be taken to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have drawn in the past criticisms that they have been accused of using the app Blackface skirting or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When a few users proposed a filter to some users, who gave them slew, false teeth and dunted cheeks, some critics were a racist caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked themselves whether they have repeated controversy to a greater problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and the indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The verge and motherboards, a day after snapchat shared that it had deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter was reminded of breaking clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others declined to the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean American student, whose tweet about the photos were widely used that the filter was "hurtful and mild."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very conflicting Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not divisible, but that the yellowing was drawn into the extreme extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural septic.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to have been involved in an endless poetry and integration process, from meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And snapchats big audience of young people - who are diversed in terms of race as their older counterparts - could expect more of them to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of Snapchats Filters is created an image that is offended for a user, so it is harder that such things remain unnoticed when it was the case, "said the 25-year Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who works as Producmanagerin and Engineering works for the medium, has called her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay on medium and in a telephone interview, she said that her impacting controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the installation practices at snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the great part of white, only male's leadership and ended their essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colour in their workforce so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese I-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin-colors that work there, but not in positions they feel safe or comfortable to say what about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their mind, a complaint, the Snapchat largely left unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its employees and shows its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees, but according to a speaker, the company recently focused on a recruitment agency who focuses on subsets populations and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu said in turn, that they will be closed her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not o.k."</seg>

<seg id="18">Democratic members of the news media reports published their own findings on Thursday to deal with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015 CentCom created an overly restricted process for the creation of inrichting submissions to Isil and the Iraqi security services," he gave Adam B. ship, a member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Ship, in an opinion.</seg>

<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported by investigations by the general spector of the Pentagon, which were recorded after complaints of CentCom Analyst.</seg>

<seg id="28">The criticism of secrecy about the Islamic State is about to recall, as a CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, a writing about how the then government under George W.

<seg id="30">Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker claims to ensure that contrary to the statements of the government assaults against the Islamic State regresists would have had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, since these provisional refinement were put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">But this finding was not published, the Times in September reported.</seg>

<seg id="1">The U.S. won fourth pilot in the field-hockey of the women, a showdown with Britain.</seg>
<seg id="2">A day after they shot three gates during a 6-1 winner, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that won the American with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five gates in two games should actually be an unforgettable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." I said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to people who keep their gates in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, they know they are: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equivalent in their group to the Britons in the first place, which after their 2-0 victory against Japan remained undefeated.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will encounter the first round on Saturday in the last round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first burner will go a little longer from the way, which will guide the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">Whatever the game may start on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex through their success story, four years after they ended up in the last London Games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years of playing a hockey club in his hands (her two older sisters performed the Sport at the Drexel university), at 16 years she became national player in the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">It missed the Olympiad in 2008 as it could not qualify for the cadres.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which she and her team went all wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year Craig Parnham was said, an Englishman, the coach of the National Team, and thus began to turn things for better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the workbook in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have the helm completely snatch.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the cake in the first half of the game with a setback from the closeup area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone out into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and kept the playing field from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam started the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">It took a Sprint with the flat ball through the left flank, then moved to the center and lute the ball into the gate to get the Americans a 2-0 leadership.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez finished the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the keepers of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of Erolins</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are permanent and inescapable, a fast run relay between competition and pursuit.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is like the Olympic fackel itself would be a burning approach, which is lit from the wristband to swimmers to the triathletes towards the triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn off the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the queue in the coffee shop without using Simone Biles, Katie Lecovers or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time in the Olympics and a womanate with grass, could have been made entirely under these known names that would be sent to Prime Time, by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he would be a swimmer, gymnasts, or even fennel.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in the Olympic trampoline for gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame is not lit any event immediately.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partially in the shade are the sports that are not commonly recognized: air pistol, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swimming and let it reign.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I would like to make a modest arguments for my particular darling, let me direct attention to the discreet charme of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline had already been a Olympic Event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it became the last 16 years so sparse that many people had asked, did not know that it is at all a olympasportart.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to competition, there has never won a medal in the trampoline and had had a athletes until 2012, who made it to the final.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians were inclined to share the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians who share them.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The bounder jumping rope has a certain outiteration charme, partly because it sounds for the unenlightened ear to be more suitable for a clownsschool than that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a recourer enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never to end wolf-up - but also the Grazie of the turnaround and diving, the two sports that are essentially united.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "Trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">Growing winners jump on a gigantic rebounder, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of sloping movements (turning, hedges and saltos) before they land on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are evaluated aloud, according to official Olympics by execution, difficulty, and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Most vulnerable athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women are compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common olympic vector is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must continue in their quest for gold, faster, upward and above go, sometimes up to the destination, sometimes down and back, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They are hunting for not only the finish line or the initial wall, but also in the television transmission, also another height-height: those of the world or the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented endeavor is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir even a spectator.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel when looking at these games as something tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">This trampoline offers a reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward-moving movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounce off, apparently weightlessness as an astronaut, goes upwards, then effortlessly back upwards.</seg>
<seg id="34">Again there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no curved into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's so Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games may only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and end of the women will be held on Friday afternoon, in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC is the Endring as part of an afternobloc at both days from 14: 00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of Olympia Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear and objectivity of male athletes, as it won the male US Turner under the The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Dooley expects his coming to air rinse, new fanatics.</seg>

<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just to break up together?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the last ten years, it has been one of Africa's stabilizing countries, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last few months protests against the government shaken protests against the government, and left out in more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed down the streets and slow-fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the response of the government was unmerciful.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses gave that policeman on an unarmed demonstrator shot and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the round-well-being videos about protests, which probably are from the last or beginning of this year, show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Security Agency for Human Rights now demands a more detailed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it becomes even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorism across the region, particularly in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expanded at the prescient pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">His infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new swing train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but an example to democracy - human rights organizations have continuously taken the repression of the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, whereby the dissidents were effectively brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many have been sent into exile or sent to prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But this could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you press people and they do not have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopian.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous ailments that cover all from the bottom line to the spice in relation to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a far more criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies got the final seat of the opposition, and now control 100 percent of parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the tensions along the border to Eritrea; a battle for this pronged, controversial line continued in June, hundreds of lives.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogades, which were imposed more or less in recent years, could benefit the turbulence and rearming themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of biting after years of exposure under the surface are now exploding.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first appears to harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians had been able to communicate via social media because cheaper smartphones have always been more frequent and improved the internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government is blocked access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially at protests, many people still can communicate via internet Proxies to hide, where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians agreed that they gathered so to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since branches of prospered the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia's overwhelmingly Christian peak countries, in politics and economics, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in flat-land areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is just changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests were held in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of tigers, which constitute around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in military, in commerce and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, has until his death on an unpublized disease in 2012 17 years Ethiopian Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts are saying that he was particularly well versed in giving early signs of discontentment and special officers to handle opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the present regime is lacking in this fundamental trade," "" "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively unsupervised reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Contrary to Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Albania, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts are saying that he does not enjoy the confidence of the safety control of the Tigray controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had been living a turmoil in 2005, after thousands of elections were protesting, which was infuelled by the government according to particulars and were then stolen by the government.</seg>

<seg id="52">Developmental Experts: Ethiopian guide for their visionary infrastructure planning, as the new pendant train, as well as for their measurable progress in the fight against poverty.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama was ISIS 'sarcasm. "</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy on Friday which surround his campaign by attacking his repeatedly stimated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, would have been the "founder" of the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarifying statement made new questions about the communication skills of the Republican candidate (republicans) whether he was able to communicate with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings forth his collaborators, who make an effort to take him during an uneventful phase in protecting the peculiar position that he could not have meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">After he had made the clearance during an election event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump returned in relation to the assertion on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really did not intend to admit to the President and Mrs. Clinton had ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the opposite to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews, he said the accusation completely seriously.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative radiomorator Hugh Hewitt's Mr. Trump wanted to help weaken this statement, recalled that Mr. Obama wants to destroy it, did not want to know the republican presidential guard.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last thunderstorm of the criticism is shining down on Mr. Trump, while he tried to direct the focus of his campaign due to the conclusion of the demand for the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton stopped talking to the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return again to this topic.</seg>
<seg id="12">Committing on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clin's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already submitted sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he received strong criticism of herself, when he said, the Russians were to choke Mrs. Clin's Emails, but he explained later "of course, I said the sarcastically."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to move the language boundaries in politics and then return to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of its methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans how they arrive, and then where appropriate" clarify "depending on how the reaction falls." said Ruth Sherman, a communication extremist who observed the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think it's cleverly enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defying the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has an even reckless sound assumed, because its refractures have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a guided tour with great lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-on-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump generally tries to not have to apologize for its provocative statements, he often accused his critics to distort his statements or to understand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is reinforced in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal co-meeting into the inconvenient situation, regardless of how provocative his statements like to be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trumps most prominent advocates, gave a great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I think what he says are legitimate, political comments" "" "Mr. Giuliani has asked him to be the truth of Mr. Trumps statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS is an almost unknown, small organization, he called it bottames, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he drafted troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in the Mrs. Clinton as an external ministerial Minister, it allowed ISIS to spread themselves by bringing the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump resumed its attacks on the media and cast them out on each of his words and to be taken against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">He mockery the "poor," wransom "TV experts who try to understand and said," You cannot do it! "</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats had mocked about Mr. Trumps apology as only one further proof that he would be unsuitable for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the eldest whirl is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland properties are mostly only in the winter for the surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This Hai was allowed to go back to the sea after an examination on board ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic Ocean - to the present day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland patients have only been born with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Strangely, the Greenland sharks alongside the North Atlantic ocean, in an hour, it occurs on average just 1.220 feet far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it arrives, the five meters long pet speeds up to 2,6 km / h - and is half as fast as a robe with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This influenced life-shaped lifestyle seems to be a panacea for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science "in any case by a Greenland entity that could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life-span that represents a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionist biologist suspected for a long time, that Greenland-haie will be stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only missing the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland hair are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the thinly populated coastal area of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water-temperatures around the 6 degrees Celsius, they usually dive at the surface mostly only during winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">With little about the lifestyle of Greenland researchers know accordingly little.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their time pentine measurements protects them, when they wiped six animals to a radio station in front of the Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Loot make this sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remnants of a seal, another had swallowed the jaw-bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they chase them sleepy animals or patrolled at the bottom of the ice cream and look carcasses that crush out of higher water layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 prior to Greenland or Spitsbergen as a bycatch from the depth of North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the maximum 502 centimeters is measurement.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to identify the age of the animals, they analyzed with the carbon-14-method the lapping of sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eyeliner comes before the birth of sharks, which in it are no longer renewed in it.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in the liner.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear arming tests bigger amounts of this radioactive carbon impact into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the smallest animal with 220 centimeters in length, the lenticity contained a low surplus to carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All the major Greenland patients had in their lenses, on the contrary, normal carbon-14-quantities which arises from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock showed a 493 centimetres long Greenland-shark at the age of 335 years, during the record-shark with 502 centimeters, can be even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-shark only got offspring after they are longer than four meters, was well-known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now researchers can assign the length of their length.</seg>
<seg id="31">As one of the animals with 392 centimeters, probably at the threshold to the sexually mature age and his age with 156 years was determined, Greenland with the multiplication obviously dropped at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this is likely to be a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methionals live mainly in icy waters is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even the previous record-holder, a 211-year old Greenland, in whose spy on Nacking a 120 year old Harpoon pointed out, was captured prior to Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures also the organism of the animals living there live on asparation.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature even later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">To keep warm in cold water, the animals often become particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal ribs heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with a grammes elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">A further advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal is more dangerous and should concentrate to have as many offspring as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary little ologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal was supposed to invest their resources rather than a long life.</seg>

<seg id="7">In the evening before the priest's flock sent the pilgrims in a little celebration in St. Anna, blesses the Pilgrims and told the pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb, I was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where a Muenster-loved woman is at stake, and so the pilgrimage path was deaway from the Münster.</seg>
<seg id="9">The single day tours were held in the morning and in the evening, depending on a short impulse with various prayers, songs and writing.</seg>

<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the roll as his landing was made by Sir Chris Hoy. the young and made the legend that he finished home to enter a victory of the favorites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympics history.</seg>
<seg id="5">They reiterated the trick after they took place in March at the railways World Championships in London despite the backend Hoys only a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The issue between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver of Jamie Staff.</seg>

<seg id="9">Skinner was the man, in which they stayed, when they saw potential in the brisk, that now unfolds.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinder, Kenny - who won four years ago with Hoy and Skinner in the Qualification Round a Olympiad record, but in the Standarters the New Zealand won the New Zealand in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hinder lay in after his lap, but Kenny brought the team to the front and Skinner stopped it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A strategy change made a great part of the transformation, for the execution in a higher gear to slow him down, and to allow it Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as BBC expert and fell to Skinner, Kenny and Hinder as these got on the podium.</seg>

<seg id="17">We have been in the Endrunde, a Olympics-chord and the world champion has been defeated.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the spring of 2012, on the side of the trays and Hoys there was no indication that he fell on the train after a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no objection of England Rival.</seg>

<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will be held on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had stricken with himself yesterday in front of the qualification as he smote him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the proportionate women's competition that will continue tomorrow and ended, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowy Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archisoon of Milngavy in world records in 4: 13.260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team leaves itself on his strong rail wheel team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to take a shot of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio dropped off.</seg>
<seg id="46">As a result, Dramas played in the background so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexcum and harassures, as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>

<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the CeBIT in Hanover as an "office in the Westspring format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot: SMS and e-mail could be sent and received by fax, also via fax, the communicator was able to achieve.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model likely to be inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of the NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus by using tools and algorithms that resemble the research by climate researches.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine if the Venus could have been regenerated with its hot, waterproof surface and CO2-dense atmosphere once more.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists previously pointed out that the slow turning of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, dined atmosphere and yet slowly moved on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably proved to be more dry areas than on earth, but had once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and to be protected from rapid disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus benefited from a Sun which has 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow turning of Venus started its day of the Sun for almost two months," "" "GISS scientists Anthony Del Genio declared in a press release." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain, creating a thick layer clouds which seems like an umbrella, to prevent the surface from most of the sun's warming.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures, some degree of cool when the Earth today are.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus, which resembles the evolution that was previously thought by Planetary research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although they used to be inhabitable, the Venus -- in the course of several billions years -- exposed to a lot of heat and ultra-violet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Her Oceans darkened and her water vapor was burned down from the ultra-violet light.</seg>

<seg id="1">Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silena Danekowa and Adrian Goinski are the first doping cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Get caught: due to a positive doping sample, weight cthebers may not start zhinsky from Poland in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are overshadowed by the first official doping waterfalls.</seg>
<seg id="4">A wishful athlete had won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh day of the day, the first official doping in Rio de Janeiro have been known.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimmering in Chen Xinyi, 3000-meters barriers from Bulgaria and Polish weights (sizhinsky) were positively tested and excluded - immediately prior to the beginning of the already crucial athletics contests present this news to the accident.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen last Sunday the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide has been demonstrated last Sunday, which is used as a masonry for doping instances.</seg>
<seg id="8">The International Sportgerichtshof CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon at the time of its expulsion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday the 18-year-old had occupied the fourth place in the finals above 100 m butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds, she missed the bronze medals.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday Chen would have to participate in the operations over 50 m Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Chen has applied for the opening of the B sample and a hearing for the International Olympic Committee (IOC).</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the National Association take the matter" "" "very seriously and demanded of Chen's full cooperation with the investigations," "" "repeated Xinhua from a Communication:" "" "we will cooperate with the International Sportgerichtshof CAS and will accept the sentence."</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history the IOC is no longer the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for the refurbishment of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Likewise in the night of Rio the news spread over the positive sample at Danekowa, the 33-year-old thus went into the offensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this was an incredible shock, "she told the Bulgarian TV broadcaster BNT.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "it is innocent," "" "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," "" "explained the athletic downstream." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, it is expected to act in the bottled substance to deal with the EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekowa was suspended temporarily, according to BNT, the B sample should already be positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgaria's prime minister Bojko Borisov was promptly dealt with criticism of the Athalian Mountains.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "I don't understand why athletes do not pull the proper conclusions," "" "he said:" "" "we Bulgarians stand under observation, so many have already been excluded." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">So, about all the weights from the chronic-doping nation may not participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday also the case 'Adrian Zielinski', the London Olympics' was tested in the class up to 85 kg, like its brother Tomasz has had three days before positive on the anabolic Nandlon Nandlon.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both are climbing the ingesting, however they must not start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the start of the athletics program, Danekowa is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The World Association IAAF had forbidden the entire Russian team up to an exception for systematic doping the launch, including the Lantshnation of Kenya produced in Rio numerous bad news.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the swimming sport, the earlier forces in China had also taken care of fierce disparities between the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt protects the Chinese Olympiasiger Sun Yang harsch.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang pinkle lila."</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "when I see the podium over 200 m Freestyle I want to commit myself," "" "said Lacourt in the French radio." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun also became the center of an examination of the Australia Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I have no time and no respect for the doping scammers" "", "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Sun was tested in 2014 at the Chinese master Championships on the stimulation of the trimeteazidin, but had to sit only a three-month lock.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data Ulau: so perfide-blackmaths your ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmer of blackmailing lists are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey conducted by Malware kit-specialists in Malpebytes, under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies were surveyed at least once, partly several victims of an attack with blacksmith software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany almost 20 percent of the companies have already returned to a ransomware extortion.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims are willingly prepared by the perpetrators demanded by the perpetrators of being able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialise their blacksmith software according to the observations of Malpebirytes on attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to increase ransom is significantly higher than with private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of pollutant software," explains Malpebytes, Marcin Cleczynski in conversation with the "World."</seg>
<seg id="9">2008 most of the Malwareprograms were to be sold to commercials.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then, the perpetrators we discovered blackmailing-software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only a private user took advantage of the target, but the change to company attacks occurred rapidly over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works for a simple pattern: once on the computer of a slap, it looks specifically for unlong changed files such as Wordpress, Excel- or database files, as well as on archives of pictures and video.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the ransomware and deletes the originals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the software presents the demands of blackmailers.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the final turnkey code to the files, the victims need money - mostly in the form of crispa Bitcoin - transfer.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where in private users the personal photo database is at stake, it is about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly higher the damage occurs when a ransomware suggests.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of affected German firms negotiated sales losses by Ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt the business operations, in one case people were in their lives.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany several hospitals have been victims of attacks, whose patients may be threatened by loss of sickness abdicals.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we say the victims always: do not pay, you just promotes the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the call of perpetrator from a standstill in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hacker in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study the safety investigator of F-Secure the commercial conquests and contact with blackmailers investigated and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to establish a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their sacrifices by chat how they can pay by Bitcoin, accessible support websites free or decode files for free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And, private merchants have redeemed by a few hundredth of the euro, businesses must be partly tough and pay five-digit money to retrieve their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively high-risk profits from the ransomware extortion the hackers are becoming more and more professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the Antivirus provider of Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">Probable, however, it is about three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their pollutant in the form of a software building on the actual blackmailing.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous Malware kits emerged, using Malware himself, consultation and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "included is a customization tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The blacksmith will then seek further hackers in order to disseminate the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">You log in one of the forums on the underground, buys the set of a criminal and tasked a further way to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per remaining machine.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually, the criminals do then carry spammers with the spread," "" "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies that will ensure their data are better secure.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of company IT officials in the Malpebytes survey trust in order to repel ransomware using a file-back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful recovery, threaten the perpetrators instead with the release of sensitive data such as customer list or price lists," explains Malpebytes, Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">The damage, depending on type of data is still a lot higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators will continue to take entirely new goals on the internet of things in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerconference Defcon demonte security researchers, as they were able to get with the Internet of interconnected thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter the activations of such a non-aligned heating could be worth a ransom for so many victims.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the offenders then instead of the heating in the future block a whole production road in a factory, Ransomware may also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">Having rolled yourself around, in the evening you are awake, at night one is awake and awake in the morning is far from the Weckerckling no longer to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one has been in good company with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch-Institute about a quarter of adults sleep-disorders and more than ten per cent have often experience their sleep frequently or permanently rather than restorative.</seg>
<seg id="5">How are sleeping problems or inmates?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be diverse causes behind them, highlighted Hans-Günter Webern, board member of the German Society for Sleeping Research and Sleeping Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you understand, it is the Insomnia, thus a inhalation and middly disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just that far many people feel as unsatisfying or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, a member of the German household association with practice in the Anglo-Saxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it, organic, mental or malnourishment factors may be stuck, but also medicines stuck.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the sleeping-compulsive expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early waking up is often common in depression," "" "says Weeats." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors lead to each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Those who for example has a discard drop, can be bad, watches all two to three hours and perhaps starts to pitting on everyday problems and worry, there are woearticles an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When you should be with sleeping disorders, to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who is not well sleeps about a month of one month in at least three nights per week and is compromised by the day, should go to the medical doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look completely different: one is disbeaten, tired, inout sleeping, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has moods or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to relieve the sleep-compulsive disorder, it is important to find their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a treatment options, inter alia, behavioral patterns, a cognitive behavioural therapy or even medicines - classic sleeping-coated tablets are only applicable for a minimum of two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">Low-time dormitory is barely mentioned in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, one should address in sleeping problems at first at the home doctor, betrays greets.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified with studies, whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should do in sleep, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For examination in the sleeping laboratory, medicine is used for example in snoring with breathing difficulty, in case of disease fatigue or if one does not find the cause of a sleepy disorder, explains Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">This is not necessary to prepare for the study.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "only please do not make a nap," "" "says fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After bonding, you go to bed at his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes in the body you carry a nose-sheath, a chest strap, and a antennae at the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera records the ceiling the dorms.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can people cope with the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of pitches on which one can sit for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeets is counted towards: regular bedtime and performances, not too long in bed, on the day not sleep, do not watch TV for sleeping, alcohol, and at night doesn't start to look at the clock - then you start right immediately, and this is quite and not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few lime trees, in the meantime the remainder of the cobblestones: the Riga Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain appears at first sight not so, but the police are one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">When one walks along the road from east to west, one arrives at playing places, a freshest kindergarten and a biolade.</seg>
<seg id="3">The facade of a gray house has someone "ugly!" proversive.</seg>
<seg id="4">Towards a Lidl, which should also be demolished soon, is already built: up to 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new flat rentals.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article about this "trendy neighbourhood," as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, but in recent weeks, prefers with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile, the residents have rented contracts, but on the ground floor there are still spaces occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin Domsenator Henkel had spoken many times for a hard approach to the police against the project, the region called "no-go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 as a starting point for autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After June 22nd, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, were patrolling over the police for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three teams cars on the ground, barred parts of the road and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, construction workers on behalf of the unknown home owner the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin administrative district decided that the clearance had been illegal, and a day later, police and builders took place under the jubel of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the street is peaceful: parents are going to walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are talking prem Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist violence is not the main inhabitants of many inhabitants: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives since 1999 in the jaw, and Jana *, which pulls only three children, primarily by the police site.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house-projects, they share their concern with increasing rents and ventrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a maxz, who wish to feel mostly political protection from vandalion Left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin courtroator and the police force between the occupied and their neighbours, does not exist as obviously.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshaking in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working quarter, which is also a low average age in comparison to the rest of the city and has high poverty-risk.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also the capacity and the native living projects are already a long time ago: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former DDR, including nearly the entire Mainzer street, very close to the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been evacuated under a large police battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga and were still inhabited by people who occupied it for 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the city district has become increasingly becoming a magnet for tourists and electoral liner from all over the world: with them now people live from the GDR's times and former house occupied their pines.</seg>
<seg id="21">This also shows itself with the rents that have risen by nearly 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them on slipped discs or fresh coated facades, which were tossed with color.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road has been mentioned so often along with the words "leftist violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours look at it as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: criminal crimes, such as bodily injury do not affect almost exclusively against policeman.</seg>
<seg id="25">The majority of the Crimes make Sachshout, which tends to make the newly built and newly renovated houses more recently.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives for 17 years in a tenement house beside the controversial 94, the insecurity could not be a speech.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is relevant: people in 94 are their neighbours who have not been determined.</seg>
<seg id="28">There were no longer the famous burning cars in the Rigs anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more of one another, than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has been deliberately drawn into the Riga Street - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That's why it was so important to her that the inhabitants took their streets away: from the police, politics and the media, who suddenly invests a clarity about the city in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of women as Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: by clear new buildings in former building blocks, which suppress the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are ultimately property flats, which are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so good" "", "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "violence and destruction can I be absolutely not approving." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do, if any one never ends?</seg>
<seg id="36">On all sides frustration, also with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For the zoomed, that grieves over color bombers, Kerstin has a little understanding: the house-projects and the left scene belonged to the jaw.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deugle is a new refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deugle is the contact person in the field of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">Furthermore, it is social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuterle has been the refugees commissioner for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social educator supports the team of administration around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It sees itself as a contact for all stakeholders: refugees, labor market refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else is still mingled.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer from the circuit board indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deusle is now there, the hurdle Wollramchsau, which above all have a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">As a result, some - less spotted than intended in the variety of areas of task - meant as the administration wanted to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people, connected with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just a hurting wool.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deusle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, work with local people and also behind the scenes and power supply.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been with me for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent spot on three years with the possibility of extension.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Customer, that Annika Deuschle ehrer and full-time actors are supported.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organisational, human and legal problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are available in the washing road</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "a serious problem has been to be found for some time, apartments for the connection" "" "connection" "" "which have been recognized." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">For the connection supply, the municipalities are responsible.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have to place the refugees in their own or rented housing rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the government council at commune and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search for some time has been very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the management does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It doesn't work so far that you should be reliant on private flats, so Deuterle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, the flats must be considered as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are set up in the washing road.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the word, Regine Customer and Annika Deulile agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">Alongside a solid base, there are tradeships, training places, school grounds, one-euro jobs and tutoring for refugees and migrants that have to be fled or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," report Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many works in the building yard or help housemaster, do non-profit work - and that motivates and very neat, as Annika Deusle.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that work for the community being in a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day will need a fixed structure, say Deulile and Customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a lack of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="38">So do you need offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So you can also jump here administration and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">It's central that the refugees got the feeling they were welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They need to explain the refugees that it takes and they can survive the time conveniently, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Who will eventually develop the feeling he could not help in Urbach, should not work and be unselfish, that will never be integrated.</seg>
<seg id="45">The distinct majority may be motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "there are also problems," "" "says customer honestly," "" "people where nothing is about." "" "the work of Deusle and customer is therefore always to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">All this was already a "Mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two of the recent incidents fear of radicalization, also in a small community such as Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine's customer clearly," "" "what some naïve call it" "". "a re-risk can and would not exclude it." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitized are the helpers already.</seg>
<seg id="51">The incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the attacks bring them entirely in recall.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many of them would love to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So, main and volunteer will have to hold on site and in the region to work out.</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always in the background that soon a new pile of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question clearly to answer, heinate the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach, we have not yet arrived where we want," says Annika Deusle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, this would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine Customer also makes it clear that Urbacher is already busy already to integrate the previous people.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political situation is so complicated, since there are no simple answers.</seg>
