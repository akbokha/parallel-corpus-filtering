Obama receives strength
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly .
the two wanted to destabil@@ ise the international agreement and by backing a destabili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the encounter , it should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for years the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been stra@@ ined .
Washington has critic@@ ised the prolonged settlements of Israel and vice strong lack of confidence in the peace process .
through the deal of Obama &apos;s wor@@ med deal about the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two further deterior@@ ates .
in March , Netanyahu had held a controversial issue at the invitation of Republi@@ can in front of the US congress held partly as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not dis@@ missed with Obama , a meeting had refused this with regard to the election time of the election in Israel .
in a wake @-@ up for professor , to have shot his girlfriend
in a wake @-@ up , Professor Sh@@ annon told him with a loud voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
he &apos;s important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was yet alive and probably excited , and he said the family @-@ contact of dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
within the house , the officials found the Lei@@ che of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that I wanted to do , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by him .
there was no indication that he was entering in two on @-@ line courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , where he had already travelled 300 miles to school grounds , where according to the police there was a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , who shot and killed at his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ l@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff did the shoot at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said he then made the p@@ ad@@ ful emergency point sometime .
until the end of the day there was another death : the Lamb took life when the police took him down .
a day after the s@@ late at the university , the students and faculty to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an idea of what &apos;s motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators to both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees , who knew him , helped him to draw an image of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers .
students said they were looking forward to their teaching .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have any history of violence or criminal pre @-@ history .
he had mentioned he in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both are represented in the department of social sciences and history whose faculty are 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were several clin@@ ations to problematic behavior .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ a@@ vers , who &apos;s praised , he also seemed a bit excited and nervous , &quot; as if something had been wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mi@@ kel Hor@@ kes said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
he had asked the Delta State University for health reasons earlier and said that he has some health problem .
this year he found only two online courses .
the latest changes in the employment policy of the University meant that the doc@@ torate had worked so hard for it to represent no guarantee of an automatic road towards an application as Assistant assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said Mr. William La@@ For@@ ge , he doesn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between him and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions which he can no longer answer .
after the flight from campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs off when he was back in Mississippi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as imports .
before he was arrested , he was killed in a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber p@@ istol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parent &apos;s house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there .
he grew up in the area .
he started his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with around 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and has been speci@@ ous in geography and pedago@@ gy .
he graduated in the spring in pedago@@ gy .
one of the long standing friends of Lam@@ bs drew him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Carla H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through joint friends .
she and her friends were in the High School , and he was the co@@ ole older guy who tried several years to teach their guitar playing .
he was then the lady &apos;s warm .
all the girls left there , when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson Vor@@ stadt of Bran@@ don .
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his call , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but there was no certificate of an marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house that adjacent to a bath in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were still in leave 15 years ago , but friends had stayed and a daughter who had now 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
o &apos; Ste@@ en said he was never met , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that he was interested in music and blues played .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail played two years ago both in a summer year@@ ling .
later they played together one or other gigs .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ man and sometimes under@@ mining Co@@ ordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lighted bar near Gau@@ tier , said he was taken from Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 . September to the last time he ended his guitar and harmon@@ ic@@ ure asp@@ hal@@ ted in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign of anything that anything was right .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the end and with each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of jo@@ kes .
Schmidt , the dead Professor , directed the first semester seminar and specialized in American natives and colonial history , told Don All@@ an Mitchell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his Brotherhood and of the Stu@@ dents Committee .

&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ gel@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans in this report contributed to this report .

Michael J. Fox from his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre on the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat is next to me empty and it will gradually realise that Princess Diana is sitting in next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins and it comes in my mind that I can be a sim@@ ulated ste@@ els and a stri@@ de @-@ length of it , with the princess of Wales on a date .

UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says , its response to Russia has increased military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; that is almost five @-@ year @-@ lasting conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN leader asks each of all parties , including the UN Security Council , to uni@@ fy and integr@@ ative negotiations for finding a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - United States , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the meeting &apos;s meeting later this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ pl@@ ored that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers will make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ an demanded the five permanent members in addressing the crisis in Syria to show the same solidarity and unity that proved to be effective in achieving a nuclear De@@ als with Iran .
8 re@@ frac@@ tures that show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious to take .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some re@@ public@@ ans try to drag Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks in surveys to bottom , it has ( still ) does not work .
ten of the last eleven national surveys demonstrated by Donald Tru@@ mp in the two @-@ digit range , and some begin to wonder what it means for the chances of the nom@@ ination of the Estate @-@ Mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is too early in the election period .
none states that Tru@@ mp will probably win the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys has been given guidance on rising Herman C@@ ain , no one of whom had even won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he could have to fight in a general election .
but outside parties , such as J@@ eb Bus@@ ses Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Tru@@ mp@@ s per@@ sever@@ ance and begin to let off their dollars to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the estate @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s Bel@@ ieb@@ ox values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey on Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the estate @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l .
by the middle of July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it were 52 percent .
now , six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures remain in early countries .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has noticed that 60 percent of Republi@@ can have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of GO@@ P @-@ elec@@ torate will be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
in a survey of CN@@ N / Or@@ c last week , 67 percent of the Republi@@ can , they would be either &quot; delighted &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; when Tru@@ mp would be nominated .
only two of ten say they were &quot; mad , &quot; if he were the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son makes about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
to the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of the republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; or &quot; mad &quot; if E@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate would become .
a majority of Re@@ public@@ ans sees Tru@@ mp@@ s temp@@ er not as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critici@@ zed for its bom@@ bas@@ tic and ins@@ ul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of the Irish re@@ public@@ ans feel the right temper@@ ament for a president , such ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first pr@@ ero@@ id nation of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ can re@@ public@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless 44 percent do not think that he did not have the personality to effectively execute his job , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not pas@@ se to the White House , then ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if they set up their nest , do Republi@@ can voters Tru@@ mp for real .
if you are asked , who will most likely win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CN@@ N / Or@@ c from last week four out of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
that is a change since the time when four out of ten had placed their money at j@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters in the past did not have the clear focal ball .
at this stage in the last cycle four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination toward only 28 % for the final candidate of Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a large number of GO@@ P voters are regarded as plau@@ sible .
even when the re@@ public@@ ans had gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp strikes nearly every one .
some experts point out that the spl@@ itting field is likely to contribute to the Tru@@ mp@@ s leadership , while the anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidate .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp &apos;s multi @-@ financial support .
he has 13 points ahead of Ch@@ arly Fior@@ ina 13 points , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally on edge Paul , John Ka@@ ze and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a scarce majority of Donald @-@ Tru@@ mp fans tells them that they have formed their minds .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the elec@@ torate , the Tru@@ mp support , say they have issued their voices .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can truly say , never change the opinion .
46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tru@@ mp@@ s is strongest competition at the moment the other foreign se@@ ash@@ ite , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters say that they have formed their minds are twice as frequent for Tru@@ mp .
six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they are in agreement with Tru@@ mp on the issue of immigration .
since then , Donald Tru@@ mp has since called Donald Tru@@ mp in his election campaign prior to two months immigrants from Mexico &quot; rape , &quot; was the immigration and fishing point in the public discourse in 2016 .
some are worried that the bom@@ bas@@ tic expression of Tru@@ mp are central H@@ isp@@ ano @-@ Americans from the Republi@@ can party and damage the re @-@ oriented efforts .
but following the new ABC / post survey of Monday , six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say that they disagree with Tru@@ mp on issues of immigration .
while so long the immigration lies in the spotlight , it will seem to be run by Donald Tru@@ mp .
the frustration of the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
on Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son now takes about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , mainly due to their out@@ sider status .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey conducted by ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider when someone with government experience .
and they are angry with Washington .
a survey conducted by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa @-@ Re@@ public@@ ans are frustrated about the re@@ public@@ ans in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied and 21 percent &quot; polite . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co. : the most exclusive residence living in Germany
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg , the most expensive apartment complex - with a view over the North Sea basin .
in the street it costs an square meter of a basement apartment in the cut of 7@@ 3.@@ 300 Euros .

a new study shows in which special layers will cost a square meter the most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ d in Munich are not really small .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top @-@ residence locations is one of the price but as a pe@@ anu@@ ts .
the real estate service angel &amp; Fi@@ ker has published a rankings of the most exclusive German locations - with square footage prices in di@@ zz@@ ying high places .

Champions League : Bayern @-@ Interpretation start thanks to Müller and Gö@@ tz@@ e
doubt Tor@@ ni@@ p in Piraeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller just has a run .
a happy match by Thomas Müller served the FC Bayern the way to a more deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Piraeus - then ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e have covered a dream start to FC Bayern in the Hex@@ en@@ kes@@ sel of Pir@@ aria in the &quot; mission Milan . &quot;
the team of Trainer PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their launch in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to &apos; llers Double pack ( 5@@ 2.@@ / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es matches ( 8@@ 9th ) deserves with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth success of series will be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola will finally pick up the Hen@@ kel@@ pot@@ t after Munich .
Müller was given on his 28th matches in the Champions League to Bavaria &apos;s guidance of the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto who made an occasion of a f@@ lange &apos;s thought @-@ out shot of the world .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate it , &quot; said Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ame before the game in the caravan @-@ hard @-@ stadium put before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich received word .
they showed a concentrated and committed show , without shine .
Piraeus had gained his recent six home games in the royal class , including the renowned clubs like Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
2011 stum@@ bled here also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went brave , with their aggressive efforts but often to einf@@ all@@ less to work .
the attacks were often introduced by the per@@ ge on Lin@@ ks@@ y Douglas Costa , which rarely went through the former Braunschweig of Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller was more lucky from right than its f@@ lange struck out of the right semi @-@ box in the left upper eye lid .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half of one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , as Olympics and Stür@@ mer ide@@ ye took the head@@ ball of the Poles in the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct withdrawal , the Tor@@ wart Roberto with his knee was appointed ( 3@@ 5 ) .
although the Bav@@ arian was approached at a dominant game , pirates could put a needle .
at Tor@@ por@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er was aband@@ on@@ ment .
so , about , when he drew a shot of ide@@ ye on the lat@@ te , ( 5@@ 6th ) .
prior to Neu@@ er , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola left a qu@@ artet with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well .
Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the Ka@@ der , sat first outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup has given the green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sports proposes Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to make something different from it , this is already mali@@ cious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the first change Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against it as he brought King@@ sle@@ y Com@@ an for the Lev@@ ant Lev@@ and@@ ov@@ sky ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Gö@@ tz@@ e arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) and made 13 minutes later everything clear , by El@@ f@@ m Müller made a dr@@ one .
in front of the game it was lost in the stadium of Kra@@ w@@ alle .
after a smaller group of partly mod@@ elled Bavaria @-@ fans in their audience @-@ block clearly prov@@ oked the adher@@ ents of the hosts Piraeus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went with head@@ hunters against the Munich fans .

who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth
who smo@@ kes , so that not only the lungs , but also the teeth - which places a Pots@@ dam@@ er long @-@ term study near .
the good news : in case decreases , the risk comes fast .
smokers have a clearly higher risk to lose their teeth early .
this is due to the long @-@ term study of an international research teams , including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smoking at smoking the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 times higher .
the scientists were observed more than 23@@ ,000 participants .
main causes of tooth loss be tooth decay and inflammation of the tooth decay , acc@@ entu@@ ates the DI@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis smoking is a risk factor , stress the authors .
the connection between smoking and dental loss therefore goes to common g@@ ums in smokers .
not clear how far smoking also raises the risk of tooth decay .
people who listened to smoking could decrease their risk but within a short period of time , the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
it could take however over ten years until the threat goes back to the level of non @-@ smoking , &quot; du@@ st@@ tor Thomas Diet@@ rich from the English University Birmingham .
people must convince people of this , non@@ smoking , stated academic leader H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking cuts the lifetime of life . &quot;
not smoking is good for lung and vessels and also results in good dental health as well as to the high age .
over 20 percent of the population in Germany are affected by dental surgery between 65 and 74 years , and DI@@ E awarded .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early loss of tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study lower the findings .

besides the fortress of the fortress and the cherry tree , a cemetery with around 350 graves have been discovered that probably belonged to the church .

European Commission propos@@ ing a new court in dispute over TTIP
to the shar@@ pen@@ ing of the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlantic Trade Agreement , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system .
the controversial private arbitration institutions for disputes between companies and countries should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its way corresponds significantly more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the EU Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström in charge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swedish has warned the proposal as a European negotiation position to engage in the free @-@ trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
by TTIP , the largest free trade zone in the world is to create 800 million people .
the plans for the reform of the current arbitration proceedings are con@@ cre@@ tely determined that the EU states and the US will jointly select independent judges for a new type of investment .
they are supposed to be at same parts from the EU , the US and third countries .
for the first time the second instance is also planned .
it would permit it to raise against judgement .
so far the procedures participating among each other is dealt with in an arbitr@@ ator , a lodging option against their jud@@ g@@ ments .
in the discussion of the past months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fairness and fairness , comment@@ ated Malm@@ ström .
long @-@ term , it wants to work according to its own specifications on an international investment court .
in addition , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could also be clarified .
the investor @-@ state arbitration mainly demanded of large @-@ scale investor @-@ state arbitration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) as one of the main reasons for the large resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by Ge@@ gn@@ ans as a way of parallel violence , over the companies compensated , they cover national laws and enforce stringent consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as camps held the proposals by the European Commission as insufficient .
he was critic@@ ised that it is not supposed to apply for the free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) for the already negotiated free trade agreement ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German economic secretary Matthias Mach@@ ely ( SPD ) , however , drew the plans as a major progress .
the Commission considered the reform of essential points , the Federal Minister , Sig@@ mar Gabriel in the spring with other EU @-@ trade ministers .
the old system of private arbitration has been taken from the table .
also the French government welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European company of B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned that the pi@@ ge@@ options of the economy should be limiting to many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized businesses could be disadvantaged by it , says it .
when the talks are completed over the TTIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ) remained unknown on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been ongoing since the middle of 2013 .
however , the subject of Invest@@ ors &quot; protection has not yet been discussed with the US .
originally a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year .

eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens is sitting on the stage at the Köl@@ ner Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
in addition to it stands a fli@@ p@@ chart , that the shy of folk chan@@ gers recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with film @-@ pencil .
the entire audience , about 40 persons , is almost located in Stev@@ ens talk .
he relates according to various places , which he is always featured on the map , to report on his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ed and delicate songs .
where they have ar@@ isen , and how it looks , in his homeland .
since then , Stev@@ ens proves to be a wonderful Cre@@ ate er@@ r .
with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; appear smart composed songs , most harmonious at very close to American Folk of the late Six@@ ties , but at any time into great opul@@ ent dri@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a ru@@ mor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michigan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a revival series : each of the 50 U.S. federal states should be de@@ ported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and in Rhin@@ o @-@ proximity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already been published and has a positive impact on expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reduces Stev@@ ens here .

one year later the musicians came back to series in New York .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) appears as a nationwide masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asive of ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered on an American Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in any annual list of influential music media .
after extremely productive experiments , Stev@@ ens then serves to &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic shipment .
this sixth decent studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but worn by programmed sequences or Be@@ ats and plays with all sorts of effect and hall .
far from the smaller clubs , the stage shows are here for colorful spectacle from Ne@@ on @-@ forehead @-@ b@@ ändern and large fluor@@ escent stages .
currently tour@@ t Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens , as part of a five @-@ member band from Germany .

&quot; &quot; &quot; theatre presents it mainly the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although here nearly 2000 guests have been ban@@ ished in their chairs , the char@@ tered Stev@@ ens returns to In@@ timacy and to folk .
without a word to the audience , the group of brilliant musicians plays through the wide enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the audience one he@@ ars : the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; popul@@ enter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can take the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to an en@@ core expresses itself Stev@@ ens , plays acoustic few older songs and finally comp@@ lies with ro@@ ar applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ te debut in the prime minister of the Prime Minister
since its election Mr Cor@@ by@@ te debut in freight transport by the Prime Minister with tension
the new Labour leader of Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is to give his debut in the prime minister of the Prime Minister and to set up for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is rising to place the first of its six @-@ given questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance of the media is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs .
he called for &quot; fewer theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could jump over several sessions to leave them to his colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ bi@@ ds &apos;s guidance , as it arrives after his appointment as a member of the shadow &apos;s cabinet , and after his speech on the TU@@ C &apos;s annual meeting .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour Party , on Tuesday during the singing of the National hy@@ m@@ ne on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration of the National Battle of Britain in silence has prov@@ oked , criticism from a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is the focus of several title @-@ pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ bi@@ ns decision not to sing the National hy@@ m@@ ne , attracted attention to itself
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he was &quot; respectful of silence &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &quot; kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour Party in the BBC Two News@@ night program , he won the Labour Party , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shade @-@ ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ bi@@ ds of the team , and they were called on differences between the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party was supported him as a guide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences also st@@ acking within Labour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ l &apos;s comments on the position of the European Union and the limitation of winn@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference , that Labour has proposed changes in order to remove the whole idea of a limit .
hours later Mr Smith , the Shadow of Labour and R@@ ent Ministers said that the Party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit of 26.@@ 000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour chair , which David Cameron , since he has been T@@ ory Leader since he joined T@@ ory and joined the Parliament in the last decade .
the Labour leader , who promised a different policy approach , says he has given &quot; crow@@ d sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 inspiration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the prime minister of the Prime Minister can confront confron@@ t@@ ational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that he will refrain from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perc@@ ussions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and fighting corruption , focusing on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic ministries , is represented by him if he is not participating - for example , if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea to conversation that other colleagues occasionally pointed out the word and that he spoke to John Ber@@ ts , the spokes@@ man of the house , addressed to discuss the problem .
when he was leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron told him to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ Theatre &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who often spoke to the prime minister . but a few years later he sp@@ ake that he has failed in it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since she was first sent on TV in 1990 , questionn@@ aires was considered a major bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his parliament@@ arians , although critics have argued that it had become a caricature and became more widespread reforms .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could mean more buying power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing force will be the higher working balance within his company , he says .

potatoes or don@@ er ?
it goes both - and indeed in the Kartoff@@ el@@ d@@ ön@@ er , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger Imb@@ iss@@ ism Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y has developed .
inspired by the sp@@ ru@@ ch &quot; potato &quot; instead of don@@ er &quot; on a poster of the P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A movement , Al@@ ha@@ y potato and meat put together on a s@@ ke@@ wer .
the idea brought him a poster using a P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A demonstration with the ins@@ cription of &quot; Pot@@ atoes &quot; D@@ ön@@ er &quot; which he saw by chance on television .
since then , in his shop a barbecue which is sto@@ cked with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y .
the idea now has to have the Lebanese government in Munich now in the patent office in Munich .
there , according to the authority , it has recently been protected as pre @-@ use pattern .
how much meat and how much potatoes of the s@@ ke@@ wers contain , Al@@ ha@@ y wants not to reveal .
only so much , &quot; it will taste together even better , &quot; he finds .
his customers will also be well attended by international understanding .
met@@ cash starts target @-@ speed campaign to combat al@@ di@@ - fall
met@@ cash seeks to protect Ig@@ A branches in front of a Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholesale distributor has launched a post@@ operative campaign to defend the market share of Ig@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million US invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , In@@ cash and Ig@@ A @-@ supermarkets are strengthening its relations with local food suppliers and build the brand Ig@@ A through mainstream media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A @-@ distributors and supplier jump on board , with brands like Eis@@ maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough that distributed in Ig@@ A @-@ shops samples and Lad@@ der owners , who sold tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected to give Met@@ cash further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler comes through food , alcohol and equipment for its annual investors strategy .
it is much at stake as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 per cent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Ig@@ A @-@ Lad@@ der business and to generate higher profits as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Ig@@ A @-@ network in the Eastern states .
buyers and Western Australia have a much greater market share in South Australia and Western Australia but have a much greater market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 per cent in Western Australia , compared to some 14 per cent in the eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di twelve months after the opening of his first markets around five percent of the food market in these two countries will cut off and take all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published in this week , the Analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley that Ig@@ A @-@ retailer 360 $ million sales per year and Met@@ cash might lose 250 million US $ by the end of 2016 .
this prognosis is based on the adoption of Al@@ di in the next year 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , and generates sales of 500 million $ and 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and gro@@ c@@ eries and in the quantities at Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed price , Met@@ cash could cost roughly 13 million profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in the eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently rolled survey of Roy Morgan took out that Ig@@ A @-@ Le@@ ad is the most faithful .
Morgan Stan@@ ley acknow@@ le@@ dges that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will increase sales in food and food business by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.@@ 1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2015 and reduce the market share of 14 per cent by 2020 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , with a business eating in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash may likely disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to respond publicly to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a pre @-@ board member of met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass has added contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ As market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 per cent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s dietary and food trading , which is about 1,@@ 200 percent , which is equivalent to operating debt reduction while maintaining high @-@ quality pressure on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ al@@ ers bet off , however and inv@@ ests over 150 million $ to improve selling prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths by hundreds of products every week to improve fresh food items by increasing fresh produce and delivering a better choice of private @-@ label food products .
met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business manager Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price customiz@@ ations and loading programs to El@@ an are needed and hopes that the wholes@@ al@@ ers will return to profitability in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Than@@ zi Kok@@ te@@ akis is supported by the President of Australian tennis - Steve He@@ aly .
Than@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ akis deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Than@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ akis was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kol@@ lateral damages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the shortest storm on his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserves praise as criticism of his own behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ akis , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; won by the not@@ orious debate of Kyr@@ gios to WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters in the spotlight .
in a fi@@ ery qualification race in Cincinnati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ aki and his opponents were separated twice through the refer@@ ee , where Harrison had to beat : &quot; WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have beat Kyr@@ gios and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was recently seen as he sm@@ elled a tennis r@@ ack@@ et , after a var@@ ic@@ ul@@ f caught a potential US @-@ Open @-@ victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ o was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is at present in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth in second place in the Single @-@ Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup finals against the UK .
&quot; one thing , about which I have become pretty good , is the fact that after my view ha@@ zi was drawn a bit into the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said .
he has broken a r@@ ack@@ et when he lost in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a r@@ ack@@ et from frustration with himself and I know Than@@ zi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he beha@@ ved very well in the US Open , even among the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on and I think that he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe he was treated a little too severe .
he is a very mature 19 year old , he works very hard , and he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working in the locker room , he is working hard , he is a very stable and well @-@ engineered young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own merits .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to account vi@@ gios in major advance decisions , which begins on Friday and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term integral part of the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversy around the controversy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Nick felt very fast the climb , where people like spring and mar@@ ra@@ ges have made . he desc@@ ends into the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and he ear@@ ns him to support him , we try to give him the consequences of his action . some time outside the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , is best for the team and it &apos;s best for him .
Europe refugee crisis : Hungary states Not@@ with@@ standing , closed the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency and bol@@ ted the border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to go illeg@@ ally into the country . everything with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border , when hundreds of migrants were re@@ acted in a no @-@ man @-@ man and Serbian government with indign@@ ation .
the people who were fled from violence , were there for an unknown period on the road between the two control points of the countries and erected tents , and settled down there .
but Fru@@ it got on board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter is ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pop@@ es the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sm@@ elled ins@@ ults against the Hungarian poli@@ cem@@ an &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some believed in protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; migrants would be returned from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a concern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to take talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence of the Serbian @-@ Ser@@ b border came a day after the 28 @-@ UN @-@ bloc with a strong meeting in Brussels agreed not to agree a common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking off Italy and Greece abroad . they expressed their hopes that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement was reached that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary not aband@@ ons its hopes for a return from Brussels or from its neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency station in two southern regions gave more authority to cope with the crisis , so that they could shut down roads and accelerate asylum @-@ procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plan to build a bar@@ bed bar@@ bed along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after it has ended a fence at the Ser@@ b border .
C@@ BS News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even j@@ ail@@ ers left in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ ght for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks and entry into the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has insisted that most of the coming economic migrants are seeking a better life and not for war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws which occurred at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damaging the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) hei@@ ghted Za@@ uns to rebuild the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws lay even higher arrest warran@@ ties for condemned human trafficking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government &apos;s spokes@@ man Zol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs Re@@ por@@ ters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree with the deployment of the military that is expected for next week , but repor@@ ters of Associ@@ ated Press reported heavily armed at the border to armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security advisor for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people trying to cross the border crossing , 15 others were already penetr@@ ated more deeply into the country .
they come over by damaged the fence , they have now been accused of police and acc@@ using criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are able to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officers on Tuesday morning also joined two of the seven fron@@ tier crossing with Serbia after having a train carri@@ ages with bar@@ bed wire , in order to close the borders .
chaos conver@@ ged the main border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to edit the data from people and pressed them a crowd to settle there .
about 20 managed to come up , but thousands stayed outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection from Serbia and Hungary and said they would deny food and water until they should go to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead against Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in the national survey
the former US @-@ Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race around the nom@@ ination of the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders will face her face towards the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ ander was second in second position , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who still did not proc@@ laim@@ s whether he is candidate for the Presidential regime , will receive support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the first elections .
more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined what candidates will support them .
but Clin@@ &apos;s supporters are more durable than most of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders had some profits .
Clinton holds a big head start among women and men , but these proj@@ ections have reduced .
your support in the men is significantly dropped , and S@@ anders returns only with 5 points .
Clin@@ &apos;s advantage on democratic voters under the age of 50 has deterior@@ ated and they are now equal to the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Clinton has a big head start with the older voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past month , Clinton had a double @-@ digit head start at the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 point lead @-@ start with this group .
about half of the democratic voters of a vote across the country , they would like to support Clinton if they were nominated by the Party .
a quarter would support her with some rugs and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the nomin@@ ee .
six percent would not support them .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ &apos;s &apos;s current support is most of all about it .
the views are stronger with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about one quarter would support them .
while 48 percent of democratic voters are saying that Clinton with enthusiasm say less Republi@@ can voters say this by its peak candidate ( Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ &apos;s supporters can be asked in an open question , why they want it is the most common response , is the most common response that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
from Clin@@ &apos;s supporters , their association with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned .
consent to dealing with the problems and the constitu@@ encies are also cited .
since the Vice President Re@@ jects a potential for the presidential office , 57 percent of democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked for the election , who for the party would be their second choice is Bi@@ den on the top .
at Clin@@ &apos;s followers , more than half the beers their second choice would be far from otherwise .
decide to run Bi@@ H , not for the Democrats &apos;s nom@@ ination , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s prot@@ ru@@ sion mainly increases , from 20 points with bees on 30 points without it in the race .
five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure has sun@@ k by 78 per cent in the last month .
Bi@@ den is by far the second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; sel@@ ess &quot; has risen .
nonetheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate call &apos; Democratic voters &apos; questions on voting equity .
similarly as in the last month , there is not a single democratic candidate or potential candidate for those voters of the first elections as unacceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates reveal good results with some important markings during voters of the elections of their party .
we consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
bi@@ den cuts down at the three candidates best with honesty , while Clin@@ &apos;s strength is the leadership .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 % ) , but 27 percent do not think of him .
democratic voters of the local elections also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ ological ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
all of these measurements has no opinion about a quarter of democratic voters no opinion from S@@ anders .
since questions to Hill@@ ary Clin@@ &apos;s &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server should continue to be held for foreign affairs , most of the Democratic voters of the election shall be satisfied with their declaration of the matter and say that their opinions were not influenced by the whole .
but it is a different story in the American public .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of the Americans now are dis@@ satisfied with their statement , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem came to light , split .
the majority of Americans said that the email controversy had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 per cent said that their opinion is still deterior@@ ated .
they are mainly Re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their views of Clinton have been worse .
although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trusted , this is still a problem for them under @-@ mentioned voters in total : only 32 percent do see it as honest and trustworthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of people entitled to vote do not consider it an honest and trusted person .
at the same time 55 percent of the eligible for eligible citizens are even quite honest and un@@ trustworthy as well .
but Clinton and Tru@@ mp are receiving some good notes at the leadership .
of the six tried candidates cut Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best in honesty .
a majority looks something like honest , but like Car@@ son many do not think of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son is moving in a nationwide survey close to Donald Tru@@ mp
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey conducted by C@@ BS News / New York Times , behind Donald Tru@@ mp
in the meantime , half of the aid of voters in the new survey dropped dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters are supported nationwide across many times in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , in order to be 27 % in the survey conducted by Tuesday .
but Car@@ son sw@@ oss in the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey was also that Car@@ son in demographic groups is well received and Tru@@ mp is sur@@ facing the republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is hit by Wis@@ cons@@ an Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen at the deepest , and by 10 % support last month at the last month 2 % .
the former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are situated at 6 % on the third place .
the troubles@@ hooting at the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / Or@@ c survey , which was published last week shows that Car@@ son grows in surveys - he gains 19 % support in re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed tur@@ bo@@ mp clear from Car@@ son .
with a view to one in the last week on rising Car@@ son , Tru@@ mp found some side @-@ traffi@@ ckers for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son apologi@@ zed to question the Tru@@ mp@@ s religion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp on the last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees warm .
even though top values are measured only in the distance , enough for bath@@ tu@@ bers is enough to find a trip to the Mediterranean in order to still use warm water .
a dip in North &amp; Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure for a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people go no longer into the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees the water in the north and the Baltic sea this week , shares the German weather service ( D@@ W@@ D ) .
in contrast , the water temperature in the East still offers the Mediterranean : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees .
on the Adriatic it is in the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood loaded with the death of a Bar@@ uch College
almost two years after a student during a multi @-@ channel ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ ord@@ ank@@ s will be filed against five persons .
members of New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ Brotherhood of Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during one introductory workshop in September 2013 suffered brutal and hesit@@ ated his transport to the hospital , resulting in his death , shared the police with .
officials said he had been bur@@ dened with his eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go through a frozen field on one goal .
Mr. Den@@ g did finally complain about head@@ ache , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i Delta PSI , did not follow the emergency number 911 that Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , such as the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national President of the Brotherhood to get advice , &quot; said Fil@@ ar@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point the members of U@@ ten@@ si@@ lien began to hide and the well being of the Brotherhood were basically informed by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Fil@@ ar@@ ef Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died in the next morning to his hurt .
after an automatic report , Den@@ g have repeated with bl@@ unter strength injury to head , torso and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Shi@@ ite of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies since 1970 every year at the sil@@ ks , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held to account , and this step by the authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for murder of third parties for the first five members .
two @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with multi @-@ channel attacks and forming a criminal association .
&quot; we don &apos;t only want to make responsibility for the individuals involved , but if there is an organization which - officially , or officially , this is sanc@@ tioned , so we will also hold this to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a bul@@ let rise , and the household will get into the bed@@ bugs , ru@@ di@@ ps for bonds will rise , and the economy will come into a recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long they last and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history for the economy is only a low guide to the process .
a recession came after the first interest rate within just 11 months and took 86 months .
the aggres@@ siveness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in the process of how the economy and the financial investments are responding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed that investors were not to focus on when they begin to increase the interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , multiple variables play a role .
at the end , market participants could determine that all the excitement was excessive because of a Zin@@ c raise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Ju@@ so@@ p , Che@@ at at Capital Economics , in a communication message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of the US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to se@@ is@@ mic shock , which many seem to be afraid .
however , this does not mean that there will be no effects .
here is a historical trend based on historical trends such as some areas of the economy could react :
as seen in the last month &apos;s market , the anticip@@ ation of zinc enh@@ ancements may make things for a while volati@@ le .
once the increase comes in , the influence is not as dramatic .
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that investments can be decreased from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps is reflecting the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analy@@ st said in a recent study to what happens to interest enh@@ ancements of the F@@ ed .
more specifically , the market is usually deb@@ ating in the last 35 years - about 14 per cent - on the way to the interest rise , fairly flat in the last six past cycles of 14,@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis that Bob D@@ oll , chef plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s Asset Management .
Deutsche Bank said that the effect on the stock tends to occur later in the increases cycle and the return begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but Zin@@ no@@ uns promote it often .
in the current case the F@@ ed is facing some conditions which did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession .
immen@@ sely remarkable is that gross domestic product will be in the vicinity of his lowest point in a Zin@@ del raise .
according to Deutsche Bank , the total nominal GDP has been at 4.5 percent since 1950 and only twice the nominal GDP .
although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.@@ 6 percent , only a few have expected that this will last , and expect just 1.5 percent for the third quarter at Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rate rises in such a fragile economic scenery could be risky and throw the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have already made a part of the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe the FO@@ MC could have approved an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trading has only a chance of 25 percent .
&quot; in our study , all contin@@ ous cycles from 1950 to date took place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP , and before rec@@ itation of rec@@ essions , very quickly put before the beginning of recovery in the shadow , &quot; says the report .
by contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession in the observed phase was .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are so far 74 months .
the fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market takes a capital increase , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than with shares when they change their strategic course .
with bonds the ren@@ ders appear to change the direction once the first raise / decrease in the cycle occurs .
at the end of the height cycle the bond di@@ version fall immediately , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in the interest rates will cause the rendering between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a de@@ fl@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ fold bonds often bring better earnings in such a climate , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come Analy@@ stin from Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is interesting , says Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short @-@ term interest rates are risen , the profitability at slow , lending have increased and volati@@ lity has risen - all characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed intensified its strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in large and whole businesses , they will realize the greater part of their business operations in the United States , from that interest rates are rising and local produce will become more attractive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
multinational companies with high debts are worse , as increasing the dollar their products are more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react exce@@ ed@@ ingly positive to three months after an initial interest increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ser@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded companies with watch@@ men &apos;s balance sheet after each of the zinc enh@@ ancements in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 at an average by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital @-@ ren@@ ders as well as low volati@@ lity in their stocks exceeded their counterparts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt is a big problem .
companies with a high percentage of flexible interest rates will lose the most , &quot; Gold@@ man said .
outside the pure share of stock consumers will also benefit through the rising dollar .
savings could see profits through higher yields , even if experts are of different opinions as fast that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says parliament@@ arians Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the sender &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on account of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; con@@ du@@ v@@ ature &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly able to differentiate of commercial ri@@ vals .
he also pointed to the BBC Music Awards and said she has just im@@ it@@ ated The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins got the programme The Voice and said that this is not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is changing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Classic FM , maintains a leader , and raises new pressure on the transm@@ itter , proving that he does something that does not do anything . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal Radi@@ ost@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly can distinguish anymore from its commercial ri@@ vals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 appears - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; du@@ sting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to be Classic FM &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also gathered at the BBC Music Awards , which began last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which began last year , seem to be The Br@@ its only under another name .
so , if you &apos;re trying to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples in which you just im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC @-@ General Director re@@ jects the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far from its commercial ri@@ vals , when it comes to public music and education .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I will not learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music which is really un@@ matched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the dedication of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works on order , I consider it really important &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey that forced to be tougher to get involved the audience when it was in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
however , radio 3 was not the only element in the BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sport for it , under fire , won the commercial ri@@ vals on feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins spoke The Voice - the musical talent show at the BBC , which was bought from the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media as a estimated cost of 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not especially distinctive ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; produced in special BBC solutions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he added that he wishes the company to take a hit from our in @-@ house shed , &quot; when the next time the company played a drama series .
however , he refused to exclude the order of other series of The Voice in the future or giving money of the stir@@ red @-@ payers for other consumer formats .
Internet broadcast live in August on the most slow and black Friday can be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , the lowest outcome has been the lowest outcome since the year 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to buy
experts believe that the Black Friday has slow@@ ed down the issues in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has been dri@@ lled , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have transformed itself in gh@@ ost towns .
yet experts say that there are now signs that the online changes will st@@ agn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure on August show@@ cases the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the recordings in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales will st@@ agn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for the years to come back to 2000 , this has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editors of the IM@@ R@@ G selling of the Guardian .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he explained that the online sales began three years ago , when they began to take purchases with their mobile phones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this comm@@ utes the one and we may possibly experience that growth dimin@@ ishes .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon which was imported from America is cited as a reason for the after@@ math .
experts believe that buyers hold their purchases before this event , each held on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers have their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer @-@ sites over@@ threw .
experts believe that Black Friday , by which the buyer could prevent bar@@ gain , buyers may stop shopping alone .
a study conducted by the British Retail Con@@ sortium took out that there was a little more than 1 £ online bonus on the British Retail Con@@ sortium .
more than one third of the purchases are done by web @-@ shops with some products such as television and washing machines .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online rather than in the cities cities .
Muslims buried in Mecca at the crane accident accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the dead bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first funer@@ als in Mecca through the streets
Saudi Arabia is laying down the collapse of some of the massive Sau@@ dis Bin Laden @-@ charging group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people have been injured after the crane collap@@ sed .
hundreds of Muslims gathered themselves , when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the killed that were killed as a crane to Me@@ k@@ kas major moti@@ f .

the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 bodies that were killed when a crane ran through the Great Central mo@@ f@@ ee of Me@@ k@@ kas were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , than the crane pl@@ ung@@ ed down .
Mr Ak@@ ram has been with his parents prior to the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials already confirmed that the H@@ add@@ sch after Mecca , with the thousands who will continue to come to the city , will continue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today king Sal@@ man said the bin Laden @-@ charging group would not have gotten the arm of the crane , when he was not used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an Arabic version of the decree prom@@ ul@@ gated by the State of Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden @-@ charging group was responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency reported this detail , but said that the company &apos;s leadership is not forbidden .
beginning of this week released Sal@@ man to expose what caused the down@@ fall of the crane , which rus@@ hed to a courtyard of the Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims face the H@@ add@@ sch later this month .

the dec@@ eas@@ ed leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a dre@@ amer ch@@ aired son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ 1990s .
the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for pilgrimage which is at least once in the life of a healthy Muslims .
officials said that 15@@ 8 people stay in the hospital .

B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap European craftsmen are predicted
British employ increasingly craftsmen , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe had an increase behind
this leads to 200 further scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which aim at arti@@ sans , to be opened
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q outlets will close over the country
von Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Director @-@ correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is claimed that British perform their h@@ amm@@ ers and brus@@ hes in favour of the use of qualified European craftsmen who carry out work in their homes .
if you are sent with a hammer or a brush to the contro@@ ling of walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays .
because British increasingly employ craftsmen to carry home jobs in their homes , the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Véronique Lau@@ ry , a new manager of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the construction markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe , offering services to low prices , is now outdated .
King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 other scre@@ w@@ fix equipment , which are aimed at craftsmen , and 60 outlets to supply B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she plans to employ more women in B &amp; Q @-@ shops , because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store are taken by women .
at the moment the men prevail over the men .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that show more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we need to move this out more strongly towards a balance .
in principle , half of our clients made up of women with 80 percent of the decisions about the purchase of articles by women .
women play a big role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is a leading company from only five women on the top of a British in FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , she also stru@@ k@@ ked her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in management positions .
King@@ fis@@ her is nearly the only company who occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial services .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ fis@@ her reported a drop in the half @-@ year profit and the papers after the group had the cost of leaving the shops .
King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ mount and B &amp; Q is opened , will open 200 new branches .
function@@ aries of A@@ I / DO@@ B because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the State Court of Kla@@ gen@@ furt , on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball @-@ mayor , A@@ ich / DO@@ B can be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and depos@@ iting .
the def@@ endants were not guilty .
one of them was also charged with abuse .
from this accus@@ ation he was acqu@@ itted of judgment in May .
the current process has been ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the former chan@@ cell@@ an@@ ate Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the preliminary examination that the def@@ endants in the years 2006 to 2011 mon@@ ies funds from the association accounts , which they used in their functions disponi@@ eren , for private purposes .
the damage can be applied with some 400@@ ,000 Euros .
the Sport@@ s@@ aries are also charged with financial constraints .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this fact is divided between the chairman of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shame , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; judge in Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
to the accus@@ ation of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the Defence presented that there was no time an asset to the association .
the Sport@@ s@@ aries only had allowance damages and the Sport@@ club , which they had spent from 1982 to 2011 and in which they spent a lot of time and money to come out of the debt - the pas@@ si@@ va em@@ ru@@ des around 600@@ .000 Sch@@ illing ( rd . 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) .
&quot; back then we stood before the situation : do we run the club or lock ourselves up ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the def@@ endants , in the Br@@ ot@@ con@@ f of the financial audi@@ ts of the financial sector . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then decided to take this task with his colleagues and co @-@ accused .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been prescribed for money that laid down our life insur@@ ances as a security in the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association had been agreed with the club : you can manage the money , there must be no debt .
additionally - with regard to the financial success , the withdrawal of the allowance is determined retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore , one has become part of the allowance for years later , namely , from 2003 , when a plus on the account had been paid off .
hence , l@@ ump @-@ signs and not detail @-@ bookings are explained , explained the former Ob@@ mann &apos;s proceedings .
the accounts and pass@@ books are the two def@@ endants in common , said the second def@@ endant .
why the withdrawal from the association were not disclosed in detail , asked the judge .
the association has not been interested in detail for the financial benefits , important it was only the freedom of the debt , so the answer .
when in 2011 an official investigation began on abuse of abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the club account .
that were what had been appropri@@ ations , they explained the def@@ endants .
this securities account ran upon the name of the second accused , and was not known to the association by the club .
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to know the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the answer for a long time .
then he said , he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything of that money , the pro@@ secutor put it into the room .
the fellow def@@ endant may have been informed , the function@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer has been formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claims wron@@ gly set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why contam@@ in@@ dem@@ nity ? , wanted to know Ri@@ dge and pro@@ secut@@ ors .
that stated the first def@@ endant , he had not agreed with this wording as the association has never been caused by any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer tells you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom you are all from the hook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
additionally he said the Func@@ tion@@ er , he never related one cent salary , he has merely calculated o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ eting .
at the diet , he spent 1,000 euros a month in charge , but the actual effort was much higher however he added .
precise documents for the early years could not be fores@@ ee@@ able .
these were after a running checking , in which everything was judged correctly , they were no longer stored , they said .
o@@ dom@@ eter had also referred to the second def@@ endant .
all the Beh@@ al@@ ungen dar@@ lies in cash , to do so , he had to go to the Bank to lead from his place to the Bank to Paris , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing is continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard st@@ extends additional 30,000 jobs
additionally , for three years of ongoing personnel management the computer giant will be disman@@ tled in the spl@@ itting of the company more jobs .
the Stell@@ ings at the US @-@ computer ri@@ kes H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) have no end .
in the context of its restructuring , the U.S. technology group plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 places in its corporate clients .
the costs of EUR 2.7 billion are to be saved ( 2.1 billion euros ) , shared the company on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of about $ 2.7 billion , which will drop from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not been completed since three years .
HP worked at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 still around 30@@ 2,000 employees .
in addition , the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ share existed 2.3 % after .
the Group with printers of large @-@ sized Palo Alto is currently turning into : thus the computer and printing business will be pool@@ ed in a new company again - separately from the com@@ plac@@ ent areas with computer servers and data store for companies as well as other services .
both business parts are to be noted on the stock market .
another disappointing PC paragraph , as well as a weaker demand of corporate clients , according to his services , placed the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer to Len@@ ovo .
in the third quarter of July at the end of July , the sales volumes generated by 1@@ 1,5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to nearly 25.@@ 4 bn .
revenues were drawn back in 15 of 16 quarters .
HP has been responding to a review and massive positions for change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only responded late to the fact that customers can buy smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and always do more business online .
Whit@@ mans re@@ organization plans see a total reduction of around 5@@ 5,000 points .
conflicts : a majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would come predominantly to rejection by : 54 percent spoke about it , 35 percent and agreed .
that other countries flying aerial attack against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 per cent have positive effects .
24 per cent tend to intervene in the conflict .
a cooperation with the Syrian takeover , Bashar al @-@ Assad sit down 51 percent of the respondents , 20 percent would qualify for this .
29 percent could not decide .

the organis@@ ers of Auto @-@ Verband V@@ DA expect two years ago with approximately 900@@ ,000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence of violence in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police imposed on the Ser@@ b border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Wasser@@ ists against several hundred introduced refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Boz@@ si@@ k has co @-@ saw the violence of violence at the bor@@ der@@ control point .
he reported telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it a police line had been shaped and behind the polic@@ emen there was a water@@ light ready .
40 to 50 refugees began to leave stone bottles and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials at first did un@@ interrup@@ ting pepper spray .
then the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
many Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as was bre@@ wed in the direction of the refugees .
so the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now rec@@ eded somewhat .
a pregnant and apparently mis@@ diagnosed woman was carried away from the zone .
children who had received the Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ a , cried out .
other refugees do@@ ged in themselves and suffered under breathing difficulty .
also the press of the Serbian police suffered injuries by the use of lac@@ ri@@ mal and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US staff
the world is observed if the U.S. emergency bank will come together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest incurred .
a survey conducted among 80 econom@@ ists who were asked by Re@@ uters , found that a little more than half , which still last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed will keep a little longer and the interest rates will keep at the current booth of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest is NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation where a major central bank may start the zero area and starts a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , guiding staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good track , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ru@@ gged view of global relationships .
she has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 8@@ pm CET on Thursday
death scor@@ er at the Delta State University , leaving for ap@@ c@@ aching
after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later asked his colleagues a note , he wrote to him &quot; pity &quot; with the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could make it in@@ happen , &quot; the authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that he , lec@@ turer for geography and social scientific formation at Delta State University , called emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and said , he put on someone , and somebody killed .
he said the staff of the emergency key that the police officers must send to his home .
he said , &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; was in the house , who will not distur@@ b anyone , but probably will be excited .
the police asked the call@@ ers to his name , but he did not give him .
he gave no explanation for his shots .
when police came across the scene they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice of Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I am sorry I could do it .
I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note was 300 miles on the Delta State University , where he was E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , killed even before he finally took his own life on Monday night when polic@@ emen climbed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said Mr. William La@@ For@@ ge , he doesn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between him and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , which repor@@ tedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities on Tuesday , there will &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was made by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she had been married approximately seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced from 15 years ago , but remained friends .
o &apos; Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 and was destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had called for a dog called Light@@ ning that met for about three years .
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said he gave relatives to a certain moment on Monday to say to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he does not go into prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen climbed up on the Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in this night , he went his car to the side , fled away , ran into the woods and killed itself with a shot .
he received a doctoral degree in spring 2015 by the Delta State University as his life purpose is on the university &apos;s website .
stars that have lost their happiness
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stressful years .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ time partner in Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer .
the actor also supposedly did fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was sentenced on account of drug owners .
all this certainly challenges its toll .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group
the Lufthansa plans a large group of companies .
the Lufthansa Group will save a half billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
150 of the world &apos;s roughly 1000 managers will cost the job placement in the workplace .
the new negotiations will take place with the pilot plant .
Lufthansa builds on its corporate structure and values the tri@@ l@@ lion Euro@@ wings .
the goal of real@@ ignment is a contribution to some 500 million euros per year from cost of cost and rede@@ em@@ as@@ gi@@ as , distributed the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , there is no longer a board for the Lufthansa to do more for the passenger .
tri@@ l@@ flu@@ ff Euro@@ wings should therefore be developed as independently as possible .
in the executive team around the boss Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings .
in the new exhibition , Spo@@ hr highlights the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ Jet in the future .
up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex .
the airline dom@@ ites under the umbrella of the passage Air@@ line group , which provides three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the collective bar@@ tering with the pilot plant ( VC ) the negotiations are to be resum@@ ed after the judicial strike on that Thursday .
they shared the union with me .
the topic of talks should be the glory system for pilots .
cock@@ pit plans &quot; to come to viable results in a year with a predicted results . &quot;
the conflict between trade union and air@@ line led to various strikes in the past few months .
behind the transitional provision of the pilots is the &quot; austerity concept . &quot;
it appears that Lufthansa are equi@@ p@@ ated in the fight against competitions on the Group &apos;s own tri@@ l@@ ul@@ l@@ ie Euro@@ wings .
under the title &quot; Dawn in the South &quot; are paintings by Le@@ ena Krü@@ ger in the artist .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can not play monthly , due to double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven won a double frac@@ ture of his right B@@ one .
while this brought the left margin to the outside and closed it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack from H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was broken down into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the board and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double @-@ correction and is in the hospital &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will move tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it is terrible - a boy who comes up with 18 to Manchester United , it is very difficult and then fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen @-@ mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have double frac@@ ture then it takes six months and it won &apos;t play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a Red Card and the suspension of a pot .
Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not sanc@@ tioned the Mexic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al affir@@ med that the Italian arbitr@@ ator had wander@@ ed .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an al@@ meter and a red card were payable .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account kept : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I get stronger again . &quot;
regarding this : Manchester United is suffering the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat of the PS@@ V
the European defen@@ ders has an additional incentive in France to rec@@ u@@ per@@ ate until the coming June .
Phillip Co@@ cu , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , everyone is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an enemy .
Mor@@ eno suffered a near break , when Mexico was playing against Van Ga@@ as The Netherlands team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is struggling somewhat because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent and if you then hear it is a very bad injury , that is not good , &quot; said Co@@ cu .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball who walked in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said , &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be .
I feel very bad at this . I am sorry .
the PS@@ V players Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ try by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not be long before you get it almost agile .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favorite child book , the prime minister decided for The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 @-@ Oc@@ t Environmental Office of Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , he writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I would like to read my children , as it always seems to have a picture or message which we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and well , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the action of the book , instead , introduces a summar@@ izing the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to expand the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city Th@@ ye @-@ Ville , where all nature went and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams come to be met , &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose exact name The@@ odor Bl@@ uss Geis@@ el was arrested and the 1991 died , however completely unknown .
as if this was not yet suspi@@ cious enough : the lyrics of the Lor@@ ax scene , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he is granted to be a prag@@ mati@@ cal father , it seems unlikely to Cameron the action of the book so little familiar . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment by the ring fence , trees hei@@ l@@ ent , snor@@ ting , pur@@ ul@@ ant beings , &quot; which is spoken in the name of the trees , &quot; devast@@ ated .
most likely , such a relatively low PR job was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , who did not read The Lor@@ ax with another child 20 times in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ person said that the text probably had come from Cameron &apos;s election office .
Super@@ camping confirmed that the text provided by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion of England team , but it is still heavily affected
facing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , a difficult task is , but considering the cad@@ res that England chooses for the tour , there is a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series does not appear on my map .
I would not close a upward win .
A@@ ha@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than those three years ago but there are good spin @-@ players in bat@@ ting @-@ up list , and the communal spirit is strong ; they will not carry a s@@ cars of 2012 just a you@@ thful negative attitude .
with the ball is developing Mo@@ therhood Ali as spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he announces an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack .
in this related message : Adam Ly@@ th desc@@ ends from the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
making the decision to permit Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his chief trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyze .
with its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ cket@@ players are oriented towards results .
there were no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , as - and I &apos;ve said this before - Player understands their own best phrases .
long ago , it would have extended the run of Ly@@ ons , but he had control over his own destiny .
if he hopefully strikes further courses for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will happen .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his post@@ ure , even though he did not put forth such good performances and this surprised me not ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question of how much time a test team gets to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton nine got .
only Comp@@ ton was given the chance to do home and moving .
the only accus@@ ation that one can rise , was that England hit first Jonathan In the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales come in , and he is a war@@ man who I highly appreciate .
he is an X @-@ factor fol@@ cket@@ player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season , when he reached 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge space , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as the before him , but of course this depends on the degree of organization in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to make mo@@ een in addition to Cook , which would create an extra @-@ spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and four Qui@@ cks would be di@@ pped up , and I have nothing about it .
I don &apos;t see why a percussion is not beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
Mor@@ een has not accomplished his job for his County of Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is it a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests in the first drop before he joined 2001 as a Open@@ er .
he did get three hundred points of us immediately , and looked not back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes into the Ka@@ der as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited dealings with him , he was very impressed as a young man .
people may see their statistics - on average 31 with the r@@ ack@@ et and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a Pun@@ t but there is no big number of backup subscri@@ bers who are raising their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot in this tour .
apart from the team England has made a few smart additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela &apos;s To@@ awar@@ dee , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games , could be a master coup .
he is one of the nicest ker@@ le of the game , who will bring an abundance of experiences , since he has played amongst all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood is used for the white sphere phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use to setup .
I always felt that he is created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the locker room , even if the messages are consistent with the previously predicted .
Col@@ l@@ ys &apos;s team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , will not be inserted at the One @-@ Day@@ er , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but coaches and team members do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as in the players what their jobs will depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy .
the Bre@@ xit camp ( Bre@@ xit = exit of Britain from the EU ) could gain in appro@@ vals if the economy made up to 2017 .
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ developed new development strategy to keep Britain in the EU will go deeper into trouble with each day , even without the choice of the genius Jerem@@ y &quot; Is there yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ bi@@ n to the guide of Labour or TU@@ C , who fought hard for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners have also their Cor@@ bi@@ ds and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at and reiter@@ ated that some member states , so deeply ent@@ an@@ gled in various crises , as the EU has now been and is not always out of their own debt , Britain itself , and did not want to be filled with se@@ greg@@ ations and disturbing amendments , which they usually do not want to be sat@@ te .
in Brighton , the TU@@ C decided on its annual meeting , that it may not like it if they compromise the social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ fie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb to summit , or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a picture of himself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they will win allies for reforms .
it is always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wishes an open @-@ out UK in the interior of the EU @-@ tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and suggests that more and more short @-@ sighted ministers and officials are coming to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we remain or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ ti@@ zed chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an allies , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her , as it is with the exaggerated per@@ sever@@ ing like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) happen .
French François Hollande can look back on his re@@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a bon@@ ding power .
Poland soon has a nationalist right government , Spain a left .
it &apos;s hard to imagine that it &apos;s going to be a leg to help the self @-@ British to better use their energy to avoid Scotland &apos;s leaving from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most of the same separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers are even inten@@ tionally un@@ inten@@ tionally clear comments , quite in SN@@ P @-@ style , while British refer@@ en@@ act campaign to accelerate the Bre@@ xit trial , assumed my boyfriend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation was a Ple@@ ite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain did not win anything from the ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans are aware of how rob@@ ber@@ ish the Fle@@ et Street can be at its expense and which EU scep@@ tics is the oligar@@ chy of the press trees , as it was not managed by Tony Ben@@ n inspir@@ ational speech in 1975 but not who supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can be weak to Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ euro @-@ opportun@@ ists who made a name for themselves as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU bar@@ ley ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his re@@ assurance , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
to this end , the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing Sch@@ ur@@ ken , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ able aliens and the pseudo @-@ non @-@ member states , who have most of our big newspapers .
actually Tony Blair similarly thought about it , but found that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you can put better ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of being at his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ er than Blair itself , when he rejected Cameron &apos;s refer@@ endu@@ red as he rejected Cameron &apos;s refer@@ endu@@ red by the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 resulting in a hind@@ ran@@ ce door .
the press has never made it wrong .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly sla@@ p on the back on Monday - I told him that he did not need any time for me to waste time - seems to be in danger of Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks Boy@@ k@@ ott Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 @-@ er years to repeat a mistake then and now .
it can take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but surely with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC i@@ set@@ ter it has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I really express it friendly - in the development .

now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ ast tendency and the wil@@ der Ge@@ fil@@ den of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ men can probably say yes .
it is what assists &quot; A Ben@@ n , but not a B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the Radio and television that week said than the sc@@ ou@@ ting in him strug@@ gled , not to admit that Cor@@ bi@@ ns appointment of thought provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ nell as a shadow chan@@ cell@@ or was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ er years , when his old father focused on television for an effort , to be loyal towards his Labour cabinet , without losing too far and losing its cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys battle was even more attractive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but to fight &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; staying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and members after all the reports on their details on Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what ever I want to convey the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ bi@@ n - think that he even has stir@@ red me - News @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and especially in the whirlpool of social media , a brood @-@ care of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free map for Europe that allowed him to campaign laboratories in the refer@@ en@@ act campaign for a matter of fact how Mc@@ Don@@ nell said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks so .
but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic ambig@@ u@@ ties to EU membership - in accordance with their B@@ enn@@ ite Bel@@ ag@@ faction economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the proc@@ ession of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic dispute .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ity to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is sure that J@@ C does not start a campaign to the exit - will foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors .
why should Paris or Berlin be wasted on political capital - they too have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions to the British when all of this can be useless ?

experts critic@@ ise Public Health England via e @-@ cigarettes
claims of a federal funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partially with connections to tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et joined us to critici@@ ze the following references by Public Health England ( phic ) in her report on e @-@ cigarettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; morph@@ ing published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; primary report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but some researchers have questioned the lo@@ ad@@ ability of data and presented the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
as an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month , the &quot; extra@@ ordinarily wind@@ y base &quot; took hold of the &quot; extra@@ ordinarily wind@@ y base &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of hygiene and Tro@@ pical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on detection of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the present best estimate is that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are around 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of interpre@@ ting and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision @-@ makers ( multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria decision Analysis - M@@ C@@ DA ) to produce their opinions on the damage of various nicotine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director previously said by British American Tob@@ acco Tools ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also wrote references from BA@@ T for publicity health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants in the meeting explained means to obtain funds from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer but not financing that he was supposed to receive from Philip Morris International according to reports previously .
the reasons for selecting the members of the body are not delivered but include several known e @-@ cigarettes champion , some of which also include a range of industries in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
the tobacco was also an active part in the meeting .
the research work of the group &quot; conf@@ esses , &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most of the products in most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , none of these links or limitations in the phic report is discussed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleg@@ ations of phic that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has so far no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes can serve as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director for health and well @-@ being at morph@@ ing , said that the claims of BM@@ J has already been re@@ acted previously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
any evidence suggest that health risks of e @-@ cigarettes compared with that are small but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
morph@@ ing has the clear duty to inform the public about what is eviden@@ ced and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
almost 80@@ ,000 people are killed on a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs two billion £ per year .
by clear preliminary performance of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should al@@ locate East@@ er@@ ders , says former head of Channel 4
the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should stop , programs like East@@ er@@ ders and The Voice to send . he said that commercial ri@@ vals &quot; would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the round@@ trip will only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK broadcast@@ ers .
he critici@@ zed the BBC for making them public @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , into hard @-@ controversial time windows to place the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and stations like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC @-@ General , Tony Hall , said the company again wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he spent six years in his time at Channel 4 without success , trying to get in touch with the BBC .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are in order or sends that would be clearly demonstrated by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the top @-@ building communications committee in the context of his investigation on the future of the BBC .
if you want to keep the round@@ trip charge , what I think about mid or long term is not good for a good idea , you should at least put your production on programs which do not make it or order .
they send The Voice in a prime time window , because they want to reach the widest possible support for their future .
the idea that otherwise no one would show this , is a joke , it is ridiculous , it is natural nonsense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ er@@ ders is another one , admittedly , both own productions .
honestly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I desper@@ ately need to see how this should be public @-@ right TV .
I don &apos;t think it would really reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , a company for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC is to blame for the hunt for reviews &quot; because of the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular shows will give back what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , held in his Mac@@ ro lecture lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows how East@@ er@@ ders should sell .
Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal niche programs &quot; should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where rather the audience can not measure , but they fulfil their duties , and they may argue if they have created to their spot@@ ted holy missions for the justification of 4 billion £ Broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ scure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
you place them in a window of time , in which nobody ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the broad@@ casting , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system regarding conditions who can get the best value from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you think all , think that one gets a great value for 150 £ a year , but for those who is a lot of money for the 150 £ a year , ask me if this is true , because they consume no much from the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 leader David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to review its Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to educate and entertain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said , few of the BBC production would now officially classi@@ fy them as education - he said it was 1 % of their TV output and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example in the public @-@ law broadcast@@ ers in Australia and Canada as an example .
on the question of partnerships El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown to make everything online available .
&apos;@@ Hear@@ t@@ Play &apos; can control brain cells by sound @-@ waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment in which they will be stre@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with genetically modified nerve systems which can be controlled by ex@@ cre@@ tions of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ den change the direction in the moment when they play with sound impulses , which have a high frequencies on human hearing , to be heard .
the impulses work through the switching of motor @-@ on cells , which are modified genetically to wear the membrane channels , which respond to ultr@@ as@@ ound waves .
further on this subject : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ Sizegenetics , with the ultr@@ as@@ ound det@@ ector , to enable a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside of the body .
Sre@@ e@@ kan@@ th Hal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace &apos; depths of brain , a invasive procedure that gives electric impulses in the brain of people to treat Parkinson &apos;s disease symptoms .
stran@@ gen@@ ders tend not to react to ultr@@ as@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , found out , reinforce the ultr@@ as@@ ound waves , which then inv@@ ade into the wor@@ ms .
the reinforced @-@ waves effect on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ en@@ channels and are found in the membran@@ es of some of the lit@@ res cells .
the sound @-@ waves bring the opening of these icon @-@ channels and activate the cells you are assigned to such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultr@@ as@@ ound @-@ controlled ne@@ mat@@ o@@ des , modified Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ ones TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on channels wear .
when he att@@ as@@ ound on the changed creatures , the sound @-@ waves are strengthened by the micro @-@ pet@@ tes and transmitted to the wor@@ ms , where they turn the changed mot@@ ons .
the procedure has some similarities with the &apos; Sizegenetics , a ground@@ breaking tool , which allows scientists to switch neur@@ ons with impulses of light and turn off .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ Sizegenetics has some advantages over this technique .
unlike light , which has to be sent by an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ as@@ ound tissues can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the sk@@ ull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporary human neur@@ ons temporary for the ultr@@ as@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

eight different rules for living in student residence
eleven years ago , I went to a student dormit@@ ory , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vism , but only now I remember the pointed sm@@ iles of those who have anno@@ yed me - and to the numerous , long @-@ long complaints about others .
most of all I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the crus@@ ade in student residence extends from slightly nerve wr@@ acking up to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it is ver@@ ting to tie off : people tell you where you come from , where and where you &apos;ve taken Sab@@ bat@@ ce , where you are in terms of Cor@@ bi@@ n and why you honestly say Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , there is only a he@@ ather extract Ha@@ haha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - place your questions and show interest .
it distr@@ acts the conversation and helps you figure out the people that you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your lashes would rent in fire and that fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people know .
the rooms of people often are transformed into beverages , movie night venues and municipal meeting places , but they are also the places where people move and make their under@@ wear .
related to : do not think to start at the university with a relationship
In@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted received a rough handling at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but a lot of student dormit@@ ories form a space @-@ to @-@ room @-@ B@@ um@@ mel culture , which can be friendly and socially and lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship further , but you have to go away so I have to keep away the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a comb@@ o @-@ milit@@ ant is exhausted from soci@@ alizing - and send him an SMS to knock .
apro@@ pos ank@@ le : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that an unknown door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship include b@@ aking .
since you start the university on the height of back @-@ al@@ ie , the knock on the doors of people to imag@@ ining himself with a plate full of browsing , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ er years &quot; welcome in the neighbourhood , I have something to bake . so , and now please smile , if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offer homemade treats is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates are obligated to entertain yourself and will end their face with a tasty surprise in the end .
naturally , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poorly missed cl@@ ots from flour , sugar and fat lead to make people sleep sle@@ ep@@ y when you bl@@ ister .
ste@@ aling food is an important crime in student dormit@@ ory .
of course the cl@@ ut@@ ches of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of sp@@ lash for your tea also ?
check this with the dairy farm .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if they bo@@ il in the interior .
if anyone miss your stuff is the annoying , and you have my sympathy , but try to deal with it as my room@@ mate , who added their milk to dish@@ wash@@ ers to pun@@ ish the th@@ ie@@ ves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise that people hold off their sleep or from work .
not only is it a question of being a decent man , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people that are sitting in the Glass House .
a girl on my cor@@ ridors asked her neighbors , whether it makes them something , drum &amp; bass to place a little qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they re@@ acted to this with even loud music .
when she finally heard at 5 p.m. , she left her neighbors even two hours sleeping before she left her own music , shut off her door and set off her three hour examination .
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would enter into the same student residence ?
in the other way , it would not be deeply embarrassing for you to keep a room@@ mate for your future wife , to separate them and then join it every day and maybe experience how they all bring together common friends to them ?
of course , the heart goes its own paths - but when a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future wife partner , try at least talk a little reason to your body .
in the exciting moment you notice that somebody has left its key in its un@@ locked room , the border between a Ul@@ timo and har@@ ass@@ ment f@@ eins , when it appears .
a good point is fun , but it only takes moments until it gets to the bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give by plug@@ ging a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never miss somebody &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
shut your door and place their keys into a glass of water , which you can then freezer - but t@@ aps its possessions on the ceiling not more than twice .

&quot; I am showing how to build good and well @-@ built today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview
thousands of refugees will push the housing market .
the entrepreneur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how quickly cheaper housing can be created : he builds a project in terrac@@ ed houses for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr G@@ ild@@ ner , a lot of refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass accommodation in containers or turn@@ around has no sustainability .
because people stay here for a large part of this region .
in the face of the refugee flow , we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a very mund@@ ane , three @-@ story town@@ house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a row house needs the least position .
it facilitates the integration .
this is different when people are fl@@ ing down in living rooms .
each of the six houses , which are being built just in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for each and four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say there is once again peace , I go back .
then the houses can easily be modified according to the respective needs .
how much is the cost ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters of space per house rises to 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without land .
this is quite manage@@ able .
six months has taken construction .
this is appropriate .
did the building regulations impose their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : usually I have carried out my project correctly .
it is especially complicated , it always makes the dro@@ ple@@ ting Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ pi@@ ke special building and space slot .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still under construction , who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is there the space .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the people respond to their Town@@ house project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who threw me to create new luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
what definitely is not true .
but do not exac@@ erb@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : yes , however , during the last five years we had a construction boom in Germany , but built luxury apartments , which can hardly afford a longer .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the only mother or the scent ear@@ ners .
I am showing how one can still find cheap and well @-@ built today .
that is why it is about .

iOS 9 : how you get the new iPhone OS if Apple Update is released

if it is ready , you can download the option to download and then install it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some are encountered after installation to problems as they get an error , the shared that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update has failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to byp@@ ass the issue , users recommend , either waiting to wait until the rush goes back or trying to update via iTunes .
the telephone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ eting of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely to do this by mer@@ ging the update . likewise , it will be easier to delete this when you delete a special tool and then re@@ install them as soon as the process is complete .
it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is loaded up while updating or moving close to a charger , so that the battery is loaded .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow that the update will continue , as the telephone might di@@ lap@@ se on half way and lead it to a demo@@ lition of updates .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Fel@@ res@@ iding and investing 3@@ 10@@ 000 euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ting .
in addition , Sam@@ t@@ community instruc@@ tors Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ists , Uta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fred Kab@@ bert .
in many places in the country , physicians - A@@ sen@@ dorf against it have been lucky : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice in the field : Dr. Frank Müller on October 1 .
while UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ res@@ ausen was reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still present to her successor in the next few months with half a job .
after a re@@ construction phase Müller opened the practice on 12 October until then he is investing 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at the St.@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy at first glance than the field of rock artists who met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ gut , who are now taking care of their medical practitioner building at the For@@ equ@@ alled hospital and to get into practice in practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the id@@ es@@ men would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ru@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it came to that I was simply called . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple of Müller liked the idea of operating their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we would like to meet and accompany the families for the years to come . &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss soon .
and so you agreed , the id@@ es@@ men bought the house with the practice .
living in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen continues to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there the second @-@ time family @-@ god Frank Müller grew up also , his medical studies in Hannover and took stations in several medical offices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a consultant in Sul@@ ingen , in 2009 he was appointed as a leading doctor in Die@@ ph@@ ol@@ z in 2009 and is deeply engaged in DR@@ K @-@ readiness to Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from 19th September the practice for the new boss is being prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ res@@ ausen worked as a school@@ doctor , his wife &apos;s UR@@ SE@@ L ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) has specialised in gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mosquit@@ os , both interfaces , want to settle in as a household .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the renovation the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultr@@ as@@ ound examinations and long @-@ term and loading @-@ EK@@ GS , and need a microphone room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a grant of a total of 50@@ 000 Euro get the mosquit@@ os within the framework of a funding program from the County ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; this shows how proudly and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; stressed Sam@@ t@@ collaborative &quot; Bernd Bor@@ mann .
in the practice around 2000 patients , according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , each quarter results in the practice of Fel@@ low@@ ausen , in the Nor@@ German practice practice it is about 500 .
there is still another home office in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side @-@ effect of the practice of practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy is at the G@@ sen@@ dorf , according to UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ lowship .
if no successor would have found , it would have gone .
who visits the llers &apos;s drive , still looks in familiar faces at the way : takes over the seven medical experts and the cleaning force of the fields of field .
at their farewell stop in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all the medi@@ cs have worked for 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ lows &quot; reminds himself .
a little melanch@@ oly she felt after the long time already .
&quot; but we are staying in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients certainly still see , &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your husband comple@@ mented : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pushed myself ahead of gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , the couple has two grandchildren and they like to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are passed on to our border line , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border remain upright .
&quot; &quot; &quot; still , it is clear that anyone who wants to launch a asylum application can do this , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people is par@@ amount .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if there is clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear signals &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people must know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migrants , nor by the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wanted to leave Slovenia and leave Slovenia in the direction of Austria and Germany and under certain circumstances they should build cor@@ ridors for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , this was not the case of the Interior of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach but not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ ridors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia will make the supervision of the border - especially Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border with Croatia was already strongly checked by the exterior of the Schengen area .
as the Minister of Ministers agreed , Slovenia wants to lack its borders for refugees but not distur@@ ban@@ ces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each EU member must fill up its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ised Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like the Croatian government , the first refugees had already tried out in the night hours on Tuesday to pass in East Croatian at the border over@@ pass T@@ ov@@ ár@@ nik / Si@@ d to so@@ ak the registration .
the Croatian police could pick it up in the nearby math @-@ fields .
according to local media since then , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ár@@ nik , there has always been a constantly standing police of police with new refugees .
it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and ans , including numerous women and children .
also rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the days ahead his country with around 4,000 refugees said Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from presses at the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ b border , which previously had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , reported in the direction of Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , that it is certain that the people are capable of assuming certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , at least in the morning , a first bus with approximately 50 refugees arrived at the Ser@@ b border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day other buses would expect .
on Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants had been the whole night away from the ma@@ ed@@ onian border crossing the border around 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has added , so the police said that we are to drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could now actually lead to the predicted displ@@ ac@@ ement of the current Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Serbia to a somewhat further west of the west .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot;
Croatian &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic previously emphasized that his country prepared for the fall of a strong increase in refugees having appropriate plans for possible exposure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; details he did not call it but pointed out that Croatia as the non @-@ Schengen member gives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
use strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partner has passed a good record since 2007 , which concerns the standard of border controls .
on the side of the Hungarian border fence approximately 300 refugees stuck .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , who runs to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities the two border regions of Hor@@ gos and back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees want to continue on the Croatian border is still unclear .
Serbian Minister for Serbian Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm down on a local moment in horror , having regard to the debates about aging origins of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , for early .
it would not currently be about very high refugees .
they cannot say whether they would continue their trip via Hungary , Croatia or another country .
helping to emig@@ rants to - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee associates have already begun to distribute the country &apos;s refugees , where alternative routes are p@@ enn@@ ed by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the bor@@ der@@ land , there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not more sp@@ elled min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of de@@ mining was sent to the border region .

in this way , the investig@@ ators found over a total of more than 100 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside of our national borders are finally captured &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it says in the S@@ EC communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ it@@ ant achieved this action at its 20 @-@ year anniversary and really sees itself with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about living , so we went through the middle of the city , and among men , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leader of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ it@@ ement is the pas@@ sers for questions and talks as well as the volunteers .
while there is a Pass@@ ant spontaneous to chal@@ k and affir@@ ms the phrase &quot; my life &quot; , &quot; read &quot; with the camper by the USA , &quot; continue to stop &quot; stop &quot; keep others short , read , say phrases as &quot; so far I am not yet , and then go on .
again and again , on the ver@@ ge , small discussions on the action took place , about life , dealing with the dying .
also Peter Hü@@ b@@ inger is just on the spot .
&quot; only when I make clear to me that sometime I come to the end of this world , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the di@@ ac@@ onian plant Mannheim , which is , together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband , representatives of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ it@@ ant .
therefore , this is an effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
that not everyone wants to be publicly disclosed to the boards , be understandable , after all , it is a very personal matter .
the topic of death and mortality was well hairy , so the experience of Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer , although the Hosp@@ it@@ alist Movement has helped a lot in recent years that people open up .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by personal experience with the topic , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in mortality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ it@@ ant mar@@ ched by calling for volunteers , they immediately reported themselves and was in the foundation of the creation in 1995 .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , financial prospects for 2016 reduced
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports betra@@ y results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ fer @-@ Gi@@ ant lowered his profit view on a whole year due to the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in its bo@@ d@@ ry services .
the company also said that she plans to present around 5@@ 5,000 vac@@ ancy workers for the holiday .
at this point in the past year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set 50,000 impressions for the holiday season .
the share dropped more than 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said , to earn a profit between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year , the next May ends , 20 cent less than with earlier pre@@ diction .
analy@@ st expected according to a survey conducted by fac@@ t@@ set 10.@@ 84 $ .
the lower prospect is despite the price increases , the average of 4.@@ 9 percent and on 4 January are effective and despite higher r@@ ashes for bo@@ ilers of heavy and large packages that are lifted up from November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said it nonetheless expects the result from the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and because of growth in online trading . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company gives &quot; solid yields when considering the weaker economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
plans for vacation employment were announced a day later than those of the ri@@ vals of U@@ PS , which plans to susp@@ end 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workforce , about the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on August 31st , F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million was served , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
the result per share amoun@@ ted to $ 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which predicted twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ acks surve@@ yed analy@@ st expected $ 23 billion .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international ranking ship@@ ments , which brought sales in its unit to st@@ agnation .
but the boom in online shopping has pushed the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of the higher costs of major packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit awarded higher income due to higher prices , while the result sank after higher labour costs in the cargo business .
in the pre@@ market trade , about an hour before opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares at 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they concluded by 11 % loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on 11 June .
at their most anticipated meeting in the years Federal Reserve Str@@ ate@@ gen spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y couch to decide whether it is time for the first time since almost a decade to lift the Leit@@ z@@ ins .
Dro@@ id of them at an end of the dedicated , two @-@ story seating and is a m@@ ural of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ Chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ella and their colleagues are supposed to put the economic interests of the nation in front of all the others .
the central bank has a second order from Congress : maxim@@ izing the U.S. employment and prices here stable .
but since the big recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is a third @-@ level mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in deciding which to pre@@ dict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to move away from an unprecedented incentive due to the immediate short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence to the global financial markets would have already more cautious F@@ ed representatives to ampli@@ fy this volati@@ lity by raising interest on the federal government - and be it just about one quarter percentage point .
&quot; it is obvious that the labour market and inflation is primarily the most important thing to observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , Chief Econom@@ ist in the Mak@@ ler@@ er Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think when looking for a pretext , not to increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification , continuing to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which secur@@ es itself the financial market itself .
about half of econom@@ ists who were recently interviewed by Bloomberg , have predicted a stake of this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a down@@ time the F@@ ed , with a key indi@@ indicator , who only shows a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increased the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists are r@@ utting the impact , by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage score at 22@@ 8,@@ 89 points or around 1 % to 16.@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed Policy continues this week sustain@@ ing , &quot; said John Lon@@ ski , Che@@ at at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if they do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they go very far in their Declaration to calm the financial markets , so that they do not panic in panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a bul@@ let increase the financial markets at ease because it would remove the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
just before a month the F@@ ed appeared to increase the sentence by 0,@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow shar@@ pen@@ ing of the mon@@ ary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ella had said in spring and in the early summer that , in spite of the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required to increase the movement .
although the creation of jobs in August was slow@@ ed down , the improvement in the labour market was substantial .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.2 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years , and close to the level that the F@@ ed considers as full employment .
wage c@@ ots have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was continually increased under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of clearly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and takes them on the labour market because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; Ian shi@@ pher@@ dson , Che@@ at with Pan@@ theon Macro@@ economics .
but the financial markets ended up in the entire world at the end of last month , after China had aver@@ aged his currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial average value fell in May by more than 16 % among its top performances , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would become the global growth .
the market has recovered from this month , whereby the Dow is now around 10 % below the peak of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market upheav@@ als influence the complex calculation , when you should increase interest rates .
&quot; if events have not occurred on the financial markets and the news of the weaknesses of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks , it would draw the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former associate of the U.S. staff .
now , he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get the effect better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable information describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the global economy is one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in its decision @-@ making . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary authority has become the world .
the central bank &apos;s influence was enormous during the last years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mere remark of the former director of the then Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 said the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ver@@ itable expansion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; prov@@ oked con@@ fu@@ sions all around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ woven , it can not only monitor developments at other places but also consult with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art as science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for the asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , re@@ marked this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions on financial market movements , which were apparently not linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
L@@ acker , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which supports for a Zin@@ c raise , made decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to cut its benchmark interest by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite inde@@ er recognizable impacts on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representatives re@@ vert these cuts .
the F@@ ed should focus on aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the New Dawn . in 2008 , Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the interest @-@ down of the Bank of England .
the latest turbul@@ ence do not come close to this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I certainly don &apos;t want to get into the situation in which they are afraid of a Zin@@ del raise because the markets were upright , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this will be changed , I don &apos;t believe they should be pre@@ matur@@ ely .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
more and more refugees are coming to Germany this day .
the warm welcome to prepare is not without the commitment of innumerable volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ - there are a number of people who support un@@ selfish asylum seekers in the city .
to them include Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is with body and soul teacher .
also with her 74 consist@@ encies , they are still being taught .
every Thursday she does it in the asylum @-@ ri@@ dges of the D@@ ill@@ inger street .
there they help refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course this is completely different from a real school .
Brazil &apos;s pap@@ al Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to clear women about how important good nutrition during the lac@@ tation is . she does this with the presentation of images of babies which are painted with representations of unhealthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins , and carbohydrates that give babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
because of the additional energy demands , pregnant and young mothers get advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by approximately 500 calories per day .
however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary supplement that should make the mothers .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet fluctu@@ ating women actually affects the genes of their babies and they protect them from the development of tum@@ ors .
unfortunately , an unhealthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively impact the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Hall
the Con@@ feder@@ ate Bern@@ ried permits the building contract for the 2.3 million Euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof is allowed to fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning stages for the long @-@ sale turn@@ around in the am@@ ber sport facilities are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent council council the work was closed without big discussions again .
previously , the Panel had decided on a request for a &quot; respectable &quot; liberation &quot; of valid development plan , among other things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we went to the permission for a special form of the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to this , a &quot; saddle @-@ roof is said to be built with non @-@ mit@@ ted first and Dach@@ stein . &quot;
the background of the planning is the intended use of the attic for solar power : &quot; this allows us to get a wonderfully large Sü@@ ver together , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again , it was about the sky@@ rock@@ back , which for energy reasons - is different from the development plan , which shall lie below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan regarding the umbrella is not allowed to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the am@@ ity in the general rule of liberation , more restric@@ tive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the turn@@ around is not a recur@@ rent project : &quot; we are not creating preced@@ ent , &quot; said St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the turn@@ around in sports center is a joint project in the community and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some EUR 2.3 million have been calculated .
subsidies are expected from the school and grass@@ roots promotion .
as a result , the building request for the 18 x 36 metre will now be submitted to the council office for the examination 18 x 36 metres .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - namely , 2016 .
at the same time Dr Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will take charge of a new Doc@@ tor director at the Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans in the hospital GmbH of the county district , the Land@@ s@@ tin Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ white confirmed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a decision on this will be the Supervisory Board , and the conven@@ ing of Wednesday , 23 September . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the plans are put into action then all of the nearly 50 employees would be de@@ tained at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority sol@@ itary with fishermen and the further existing Internal Station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are present .
the employees , who can not be offered to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a place in Wei@@ l@@ heim , Jo@@ chner @-@ White .
the employees are informed of the plans .
triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer hospital since the beginning of the year , is now changes to a private practice in direct proximity of the hospital .
in the question of who plans to compete , according to Jo@@ chner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over as of 1 October and to switch along with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this was in any case a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de@@ valuation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the range in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Jo@@ chner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ aker and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised on the interior of the main station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic illnesses .
for the next two years , fishermen with his team , when the Supervisory Board agree that the Supervisory Board will agree , until then next year the former Hospital of Kn@@ app@@ el , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
so far , the County has planned this for 2018 , if the ongoing renovation work was completed in the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital .
land@@ illing Jo@@ chner @-@ White , which is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , rum@@ ors contrary to what the house , which is owned by the federal capital , should in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers .
&quot; the closure I came from . &quot; as it goes on with the property , Jo@@ chner @-@ wh@@ ites could not say there are several reflections .
there are currently a short @-@ time care of the Car@@ itas and a conference family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity is not coming again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said fishermen about the Qu@@ asi @-@ Mo@@ ve to the Le@@ ch which has been accepted by employees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house , in which fishermen has been working as a che@@ i for over 30 years , did not exist .
he had been asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of doctor &apos;s director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was regularly threatened in the past few decades , departments were closed , for example the surgery and the Obst@@ etri@@ cs .

refugees need accommodation : study awaits prior arrangement
the situation on the German apartment market is tense .
even more and more refugees are looking for a affordable stay .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution battles in the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU more and more people push towards a market that is over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with a very low level of citizens around the final affordable apartments .
to cover the demand for affordable housing , one would need to build 400@@ ,000 new units up to 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to this result comes a study on behalf of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compared : this year there are 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units finished in Germany .
the absence of 14@@ ,000 apartments are missing .
refugees are no longer obligated after the first three months of their stay , as asylum seekers in an introductory accommodation .
many of them come across the apartment market and pick up in the long sn@@ akes before the rented apartments .
according to statistics in the last year , however , less than half of all asylum seekers live to rent .
the negative development of the apartment market , however , is not only due to rising tide of refugees .
the study also makes significant failures in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is going to be a housing deficit only from year to year .
currently , in the ag@@ glomer@@ ations there are already approximately 7@@ 70@@ ,000 units , laments Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many occupational sciences are therefore dwelling in capitals of emergency rooms in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults remained un@@ voluntarily on the apartment market because of the F@@ lau@@ te on the apartment market . &quot;
in the large cities , the number of square meter per capita has declined in recent years .
to resolve the issue , the alliance &quot; social housing &quot; proposes a new start .
new incentives are intended to boost social housing .
this could be reduced to the under@@ estim@@ ation tax and the basic tax will be exposed for subsi@@ dis@@ ed apartments .
and , according to the alliance , attractive allow@@ able shut@@ ters would be necessary .
the funding program for Refu@@ ge Transport , Kf@@ W comes well in towns and villages .
after the start , a good week after the start was opened on Monday , with 18@@ 4 million euros , more than half of the currently available some 300 million euros .
now the project could even be extended .
refugees have free terrain : Croatia and Slovenia do Cor@@ ridor infrastructure
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary , practically no way out , there are more and more refugees making the way to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb announces its departure via Slovenia to North without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to keep Slovenia itself with the neighbouring Slovenia via the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have spoken with the Sloven@@ ian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sloven@@ ian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leader and when it is necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and has already been part of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU @-@ country Croatia does not yet have Schengen lands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the shut@@ down of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees arrived to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people had come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ár@@ nik , reports the Croatian Tele@@ sa@@ hen@@ ary RT@@ L .
Hungary had rec@@ alled its border to refugees on the day before .
new laws that occurred on the same day are almost redund@@ ant in Hungary in practically su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to make the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian prime minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through , and we are preparing for that possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who do not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had taken up the first refugees on the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia in Croatia .
most of them are reporting , according to Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they arrived both by bus and Ta@@ xen in the Ser@@ b border town Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival they tried to get on foot across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border the refugees did not encounter the border f@@ ences .
this puts the border guard other dangers . there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
de@@ mining should now quickly create a safe passage .
more refugees arrive after Hungary after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday the police took 3@@ 66 .
shortly before door@@ step on Monday , it had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws are mounting and damaging the border za@@ ar in a criminal off@@ ence .
therefore , in the Southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed , there were 35 criminal procedures introduced .
the thre@@ aten withdrawal from prison for up to five years and the deportation from the country .
according to the immigration office , I took orders in the newly established &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tran@@ port@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a total of 94 asylum orders , including almost all - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the applicants , 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
there were still 40 refugees on Wednesday morning .
however , no one does not have a view to get granted in Hungary .
according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; safe &quot; third country . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rejected asylum seekers should be put down there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; before the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tran@@ sit@@ ing zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke there were only a few hundred refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke they began to pri@@ ori@@ ze workers .
they gathered the trash , which left tens of thousands of people in the last weeks at the road@@ side .
pl@@ y@@ screens were degra@@ ded and one of the recording @-@ camp in the border town was rebuilt .
to the purpose of this building , nobody wanted to express himself .
Austria still only reach a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
around the 20,000 migrants left after government figures but still in the country .
around 1400 men are waiting for the continuation of Germany in Salzburg .
in the morning the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped at the request of German authorities .
there are regular groups of refugees trying to walk in fre@@ ew@@ heel .
Mayor of the World on the border
&quot; we were busy after the Brü@@ cken@@ fest on Sunday with the ins@@ cription , when suddenly ten people were standing with rice carri@@ ages at the entrance of the tent , &quot; so Wern@@ stein &apos;s Mayor of Alois Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany on Sunday , however , due to the refugee flow , had set up the rail traffic with Austria , was for them in Wern@@ stein concluded , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and the cars ended together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border into the Near Pass@@ au .
previously we had the un@@ hoped guests first of all at once , with J@@ ause and Be@@ ver@@ ages .
we said the same , we drive them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; said the city council in O@@ Ö@@ N &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire@@ brig@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this makes us very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surve@@ yed passage were risen on Sunday evening in Wels from a ICE in a regional train towards Pass@@ au , to make it possible after the short notice that the railway traffic to Germany was stopped , but still trying the border to Germany .
but in front of the border in Wern@@ stein am Inn , the regional train was dropped off .
in Wern@@ stein , the trans@@ national is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bav@@ arian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ able , day before a two @-@ gn@@ at sports - organized by the union Wern@@ stein und Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent further tens of thousands of us , is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
rather than in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in order to help erect the construction of structures , the Chancellor continued our German Chancellor S@@ ail and publicly present the position of the Hungarian government in the darkness of National Socialism .
Un@@ fortunately , this policy is not just those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic states now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the refugees will have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they invited and welcome , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a great challenge , given the ongoing refugee streams and the coming winter , to prepare for decent conditions for protective seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Conrad in search of 3@@ 5.000 winter@@ y Quar@@ tz@@ ing
finally Conrad has all hands to do with the refugees .
Christian Konrad is it familiar to have his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ffe@@ isen banker to make accommodation for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first @-@ state center of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has finally got a grip on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported by his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great turmoil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Interior Ministry said in contrast to a &quot; cr@@ is@@ cal situation . &quot;
overall , Conrad is reck@@ oned with an increase of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the He@@ ur@@ ing year .
to meet the number , must be found 35@@ ,000 accommodations within the next few weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15,000 the Bund .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; but it is not a bot@@ tom@@ less pit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already led talks with the Gover@@ nor .
they would have promised him to create aff@@ ability for the coming refugees too .
&quot; in Upper Austria , it works well , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er .
the former VP of the Al@@ atar will be supported Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Car@@ dinal Christoph Schön@@ born , and it should be settled , as the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; great expectations are also committed to the asylum coordinator in the OR@@ F action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Help &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
private individuals are uncomplicated to offer accommodation on the platform .
it also hopes to see hotels that are empty in winter .
finally Conrad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as a &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of times , it cannot be that accommodation owners must respect a certain amount of the towels or size of the colon@@ ists .
for a perpet@@ ual time &quot; Emer@@ gency &quot; must be considered .
that in contrast to the Interior Ministry he is more successful when creating more successful , Konrad with his experience .
I am an older gentleman who is not going to face the fal@@ se@@ hood without further notice .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
finally Conrad and Mai@@ er do not cause the Republic to act as they ourselves said .
their number of employees want to increase them at three to four .
the own accommodation owner has not been successful until now .
finally he wanted to set up a container at Stephan@@ splatz as office .
but , there are obviously issues with the permit .
Linz calls for a better distribution
first , no opening of the city halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees plan the city of Linz .
currently , this is not necessary , as the persons concerned are currently able to accommodate these measures , &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
however , in case of an emergency , further sites are expected to be tested for their flexibility .
critic@@ ising the city &apos;s director on the division of refugees within the Bundes@@ land .
other areas must also make their contribution here .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; boundaries are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone call with the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , the Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ er ( VP ) received the further proceedings in the refugee question .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer said me that the German borders are not sealed .
the onward journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however there are just the appropriate border controls .
special must be made with refugees after Germany there will be no more .
the prot@@ esting species would however be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other EU member states called for more increased solidarity in the field of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that now Austria leads again to its borders , it is a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the course of action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
the general admission of the &quot; New Wor@@ ft &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 2@@ 700 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he can imagine investing in Star@@ tup from the New Wer@@ ft job to invest in new qui@@ ties .
from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - from where Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises quite a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
1.@@ 7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the premises , 3,@@ 3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is operated from Linz AG for 60 years on S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 per cent of the 2@@ 700 square meters of space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ ist opened a second shop in the arcade
in the new shop Fur@@ la hands are in the center .
actually J@@ utta was just to suggest a dog .
this project had to pushed for the 49 @-@ year @-@ old In@@ hab@@ erin of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ ar@@ cades : finally , it got po@@ unding in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , in which they sold under way bags , suitcase , shoes and gar@@ b of different manufacturers , now all is about Dam@@ en@@ handy cap@@ tures of the brand Fur@@ la , pur@@ ses and from 75 Euro to have .
larger hand@@ bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
previously , several weeks been re@@ developed .
&quot; but I have long over@@ laid out whether I still want to open a store , &quot; says wide .
decisive for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers who are in Bologna at home from the idea of an own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the Only in the Greater Linz , which sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has the own Italian roots .
her fashion interest has been widely placed by her mother in the cradle .
remember most when something develops and I can show new trends at an affordable prices .
why so put some woman in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in timi@@ dly , the lady can also not answer with the last safety .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag is upgraded every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ ter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ al@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called gi@@ ver .
this property also connects to the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the U.S.@@ -@@ President .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for isolation .
whether it is alien@@ ated himself from xen@@ opho@@ bic , journalists touching or transfer awareness in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office wir@@ ling the election campaign strongly .
and cuts well in it .
this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ean K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grandparents of the real estate agent date .
the New Yorker with the com@@ promis@@ son is many in the vin@@ t@@ village at the wine road .
some in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ village is related to it is related to it .
his grand@@ si@@ re came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in the election campaign .
the K@@ all@@ iter@@ ate Simone Wen@@ del filmed a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the villagers think of his goal to become more powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think that somehow is exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed at their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native town of K@@ all@@ ante has made a am@@ using documentary on the place and its famous Spr@@ ös@@ s@@ lings , to which besides Tru@@ mp also the Ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tru@@ mp , which is not known for mod@@ esty , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
admittedly I give respect for the performance of the family , but also tends to make the opinion that Tru@@ mp &quot; has a bit of a mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ den@@ ary of the nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the circle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to speak German : the gi@@ ver , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Tru@@ mp comes from the village of An@@ gi@@ ers .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened in the US a local e@@ at@@ cher .
foundation of the property Group were first ground@@ work purchases in New York .
but the life of grandparents was not free of tragedy , her wish to return to the home , failed in the Bav@@ arian State , to which the Palat@@ inate was at that time belonged .
he did not record Tru@@ mp because he was once broken without permission , the director of the Institute for pf@@ alz History and Folklore , Roland Paul , had declared film start .
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illi@@ cit agent . &quot;
this is a contrast to the sometimes striking statements by the descendants .
he had repeatedly discussed the import of Mexican immigrants in the US and requested the construction of a border wall to sc@@ are illegal immigrants .
&quot; just as pol@@ ishes , that is not so sympathetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relatives ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the Op@@ a was borrowed Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ e@@ gro@@ wer in retirement looks rather dist@@ ancing the Americans more dist@@ anced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so ard@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
believes that Tru@@ mp comes ?
&quot; I cannot imagine this , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has never looked after K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pend@@ ant Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ r@@ amm is mentioned as man@@ cher K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz with a visit to the church organ concluded , which came generally well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can I not imagine of Donald Donald &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they prefer it better if he doesn &apos;t know the choice because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such a radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had had the seeds at the time of his grandfather in the US , he would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he had never arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more exciting topics like him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ on Sarah Dance .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe even without the president of Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , which was interviewed for the Tru@@ mp for a long time , have seen 12 000 movies , even in the U.S. awak@@ ens the interest .

seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite the attempts of Nine , to take the loss of leadership in the today Show
Charles Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson is flying to Can@@ ber@@ ra in order to report afterwards to the loss of the leaders of the liber@@ als , but it has no major shifting of the reviews for today .
the breakfast show of Nine was broadcast@@ ed by the state capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Riv@@ ale Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Samantha Ar@@ my@@ days , stuck in London as part of a week series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cun .
this disadvantage of the board seemed to play a role for Australian TV spectators , since Sun@@ rise above 39@@ ,000 spectators were scored at the five major cities , compared to today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today a slight increase in the rating for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and the last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today the gap to Sun@@ rise in the last few months has been closed .
on an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 , today the average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 reached the 33@@ 0.000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year there were gap between 40,000 and 50,000 .
up to now in September Sun@@ rise at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators stand at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 by today .
this is the most interesting thing that happ@@ end every morning .
the winds of change affect these dawn more than the parliament !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar of packed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama above a recently @-@ wit@@ ted father , who decides to settle down with his two children at the New Ze@@ al@@ ands , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators .
critics had asked yourself whether Thom@@ son could take a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the outcome of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; Yes . &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strongly with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and hit the block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ B@@ L ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z @-@ show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ K@@ ee@@ fe emerged as an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday night the first half hour from The Ch@@ ase Australia had 20,000 viewers and in the second half an hour was 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ a of the second evening by The Ch@@ ase Australia will make Nine confident that hot @-@ se@@ at will ultimately assert at 17 : 30 o &apos;clock .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a substitute for a million dollar minute that is not managed to over@@ see the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the final three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ know@@ ingly inspired who is winning The Bachelor .
the woman , finally landed at Sam Wood in The Bachelor , has been covered in greatest secrecy .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether they are the one who received the last rose .
but when we were with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before out of three two , you may accidentally have given a clue to who will be the winner .
Sam Wood continues his lips to the final on Thursday
all three women have left themselves on ly@@ ric so why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , ambition , family values , and positive attitude as reasons for why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who ought to receive the last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could their answers to the kill@@ joy become who won the heart of the torrent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki are both named fast - except itself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner in wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had an easy relationship with each other from day one .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ s energies noticed , because I felt they were rather compatible and I thought it was throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is standing on earth with both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; he added .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay thinks she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house @-@ house last week her husband said that Wood was &quot; the One . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m firmly referring to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked to choose who wood should vote , if not she , there was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say this , &quot; she said .
I love the left @-@ loving girls alike - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , on Ten .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams being sent to requests following his impressive workout day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a smart choice .
some coach would have run Hay@@ ne for the remainder of the game onto the bank as he lost a bar@@ e@@ angel as it did the Aussie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by @-@ Liga conver@@ ge in his first Pun@@ t return on Tuesday with 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next chance to a Pun@@ t return and also in the running play after a violation of reg@@ gy Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of leaving his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula made him public in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams Co@@ ordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ g@@ hey , who instructed him to forget his tri@@ pled tor@@ ang and to look after the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne patented at a Pun@@ t , who was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start to take Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian ge@@ aring for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble flu@@ ch@@ end the playing field and talked later on the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not present itself to his N@@ FL career .
&quot; it was a thing that happens now , one only takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne .
Hay@@ ek combines the Schn@@ itzer with his Ori@@ gin debut then in 2007 , when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Queensland .
overall it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

party and Leader of Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ autumn morning in front of a serious crisis at Bay@@ erns schools , when there is no new teacher for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools before a collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get ent@@ an@@ ings in the Bav@@ arian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the free @-@ day survey of the free voters will conven@@ es to Friday in the Frank@@ ish commune .
actually , were quite different main topics .
but the record number of refugees now dominates the free voters meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the topic for asylum seekers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protective zones for refugees in Syria , as they were in the early 1990s during the Nazi war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it doesn &apos;t go any further , we need to get to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the free vot@@ er boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to push the free voters as quickly as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is why Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administration of administration which are responsible for asylum seekers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum @-@ refer@@ ee , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the F@@ W leader critici@@ zed that several Bundes@@ länder cannot be consistent : &quot; we need nationwide nationwide standards of the federal states . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there we need to act more efficiently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the national policies of the big s@@ wir@@ ling should not fall under the table .
a long experience of ever@@ gre@@ ens remains on the order of the day : the defence policy .

but this is not far enough .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W leader .
we call for freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ ums they want .

4 People killed after shooting the rubber bul@@ lets on demonstrators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police broke out rubber @-@ stories , who demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said an official on Wednesday .
the force broke down the evening in district R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , leader of the officials , said that there had more than 1,000 prot@@ esters outside of a police station , whereby some of you threw the stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said , the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and pushed into the air before it ra@@ ils on rubber bu@@ mp .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were wounded , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber @-@ stories known , known to whom they can admittedly can kill , which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the argument was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nepal as the southern stage , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ ness i say that new provinces to be formed under the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of the people , who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , became violent conflicts since the 10 .
August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement signed in provinces to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution but a very controversial subject in Nepal , which has been governed centrally for centuries .
since 2008 the work on a new constitution is on its way , but the legisl@@ ator accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lature have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional bill in Kathmandu and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .

now the plans for a new holiday cottage at the Little Sea are near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Inter@@ esting , the mid @-@ range Em@@ der company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System @-@ Bau &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Municipal Committee of the Em@@ den Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally , this point had been on the not @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project Cri@@ tics and the F@@ DP Group , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends , passed from the system building management to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered an answer to all questions , &quot; he said before the Council &apos;s membership and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors now .
it has been in the discussion around ten to twelve million euro have been in discussion since months .
fierce reactions among the he@@ ap owners who had come at the meeting were the pictures and new details about the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , sea @-@ owner and board member with the Adv@@ oc@@ acy of the An@@ lie@@ ger , Pro H@@ ie@@ ve , compl@@ ained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z that over@@ looks all the other structures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears like several other project critics that would increase traffic by the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must come entire bus inv@@ itations , so that it counts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the good a h@@ ect@@ are of the former farm place is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a conclu@@ sive concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still missing , the development plans were still vari@@ abel .

Google starts re@@ dou@@ bling donations to collect 11 million US refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ donation campaign that aims to raise the 11 million US $ and humanitarian organisations , who ro@@ de the thousands of refugees who ro@@ ve the European nations , as they escape from the war of their growing and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of the Don@@ ation call on his blog .
instead of making a manager to make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google agent who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul than she was seven years old , about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our journey there were many dark rail and bus trips , as hunger , thirst , cold and fear &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants have grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
funds go to four non @-@ profit organisations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million CZK / so@@ er@@ el@@ ief in 11 million $ doubled .
Europe has been facing the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has been driven more than 4 million people this year .
many fled also from the war torn as Iraq , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly overweight di@@ diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if slightly overweight people with diabetes regarding weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality dates need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , which wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ ama Surgery .
weight @-@ loss surgery or obesity , use different methods to reduce the size of stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years obesity have proved efficient in obesity in the treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes than efficient , but most of the studies were conducted in people who are being obes@@ e with a Body measure index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a degree of weight in terms of size , is regarded as normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that somebody is overweight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two kinds of obesity , stomach @-@ stomach and ga@@ stri@@ ction related to medical treatments for type @-@ 2 diabetes in people that were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those who undergo this surgery sank from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile the BM@@ I stayed with those that did not receive @-@ surgical Diabetes treatments approximately with the same at 29 .
amongst those who undergo a surgical procedure , del@@ etes with 36 % of the diabetes disease completely and at 28 % partial .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group the diabetes is completely dissolved by one percent and in some cases only two percent in total .
in addition , the results were higher in the control of blood pressure , the tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitoring the patient @-@ blood levels of ha@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c that reflects the blood sugar values in the course of time .
Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept at 7 percent , send the researchers .
after surgery the average ha@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c increased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical treatment group there remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as you reflected in the improved h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c High - did not decrease the mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng h@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also provides average results with the two kinds of surgery .
in the fifth year , the B@@ yp@@ ass surgery @-@ group had lost its weight compared to the host @-@ tom@@ y group ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kilo@@ gram ) , reaching higher decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3,@@ 1 % vs. 2 % ) and reported rather a complete overthrow of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of the surgery after five years , there are indications of a study of severe humans in Sweden , that surgery results in a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who undergo a obesity , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that was conventional methods .
although the new study has no advantage to survival with the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for persons with a BM@@ I below 35 which are interested in the process .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increasing risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously once the patient is with their BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we get people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that once they have collected these genetic changes , having bound their bodies with obesity and diabetes is a revers@@ al really hard . &quot;
love @-@ story takes place in the H@@ uns@@ rück .
it is a subject that often takes attention in fiction : a young woman who is im@@ pas@@ se at school times and im@@ si@@ gh@@ tly , after years she met the flock of her youth and he loves herself in her .
so also in the recent novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Luisa Bin@@ der .
about the love story , the novel can be interesting for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , for it plays in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional author in Lang@@ wei@@ ler grew up in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and is pleased that she was able to find a literary monument to her home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ news &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europe cannot accept all refugees , the Dalai Lama promised and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East .
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist leader urged to end the violence in the refugees &apos; home countries .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of enduring refugee crisis to begin its ten @-@ day visit in the UK in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , devoted to ethics studies .
he demanded that , under the circumstances , the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of the Western European countries was admir@@ able on the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
although the Dalai Lama and Austria &apos;s efforts in dealing with the crisis praised that it was just a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think long @-@ term solutions , like true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we have to think about how the killing in their countries is reduced .
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and also discussed George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 , and turned out that the violent reaction from the USA moved a chain of un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able events .
after September 11 I put my applause in a letter to President Bush and said to him , the way to solving this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he set violence , and that has established unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of in@@ gestion of hands @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants through children in the past 4 years
po@@ cket@@ book centers in the USA report about an almost 400 percent increase in number of children under 12 years that swal@@ low alcoholic beverage inf@@ ect@@ ants , such that Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , climbed the cases of revenue of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants for children under 12 years , who report the po@@ cket@@ control centers , from 3.@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are becoming more common at these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them enter in the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media .
videos on YouTube show how adolescents dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap adventure .
young people have allegedly inf@@ ect@@ ant with alcoholic beverages in order to get a tougher beverage .
younger children can be instructed by attractive fragran@@ ces of the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are the ones who are che@@ ated .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and oran@@ du@@ es , which are very pleasing for children .
hanging dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants included somewhere between 45 and 95 percent of alcohol .
especially with infants can already cause a few dri@@ ps to alcohol poison@@ ing .
&quot; it is most concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ fts Centre in the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the transm@@ itter Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you would not let go of a sip whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come from it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year girl , who recently acquired four spra@@ yers of after straw@@ berry cent@@ ri@@ tic hand@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in school , was brought into an emergency treatment .
her blood soft concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is considered to be drunk in an adult . Dr Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor who treated them at the G@@ win@@ nett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah was all@@ u@@ ated her words and was unable to walk as she came up in the emergency .
doctors taught them overnight in a separate children hospital in signs of deer trau@@ ma , since the girl fell by the alcohol and encountered the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; this was very wor@@ ris@@ ome , &quot; said Or@@ tor@@ ia Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants to use and hand san@@ i@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol poison@@ ing , a number of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants have been associated with death cases .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after the gor@@ ges of ham@@ mo@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants who were a toxic , not de@@ cl@@ ed ingredient .
workers of health authorities suspect that the product meth@@ anol enth@@ used , a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ anol , which was noted as active ingredients .
in January , three students of the fourth class in the state of New York , their &quot; fin@@ es &quot; teacher will be too po@@ ised by they used anti@@ bacterial products all around the classroom , &quot; says a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ex@@ iles them from their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police regarded the failed plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; g@@ ossi@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and an interdisciplinary approach to the school authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Griff@@ i@@ ths play with a talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
there are rum@@ ors about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was spontaneously prepared by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insisted that he and his team @-@ amer@@ ates are not under enhanced control since they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch championship leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of the front contest in the Scottish soccer is boring - de Bo@@ er
the former Rang@@ ers mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national players of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title @-@ rival@@ ry with the ranking .
de Bo@@ er , currently a Ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they do not show highlights of Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here are not just talking about the return of the ranking .
you are talking about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
there is a lot of tension in the Old Fir@@ m games and it is not just the people of Scotland looking to see these games .
I will wander about things , v@@ ow D@@ ei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny D@@ ei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight but the Norwegian chief sw@@ ath to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malmö and the following departure from the Champions League followed the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who now stand out clearly at the top of the table with five points .
D@@ ei@@ la said , &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we just feel the same - but we need to go on .
we really need the support from Celtic , because that makes the player better .
to stand together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton carefully at January @-@ transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago , that pointed out that he told some January transfers , is Rang@@ ers Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton carefully at the signing of new appro@@ vals and ins@@ ists that he doesn &apos;t want to bother the unit of the I@@ bro@@ x squ@@ ad .
the ex @-@ chief of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; the January @-@ Transfer window is very different from the Summer @-@ Win@@ dow . &quot;
players who come in the summer will have this pre @-@ season time to integrate with what you saw with our own group in this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by going un@@ necessary players to the one you really need .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK it continues to rise .
unemployment in Scotland stayed unchanged from May until July in 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people with no work for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate amoun@@ ted to 5.@@ 9 percent over the number of 5.5 per cent , as the figures of the office for national statistics ( ons ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell at 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell to EUR 7@@ 4.3 percent over the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3,5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months we have witnessed further improvements on the Scottish labour market , an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment .

why I become a Exec@@ ution of a Exec@@ ution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
something later today , except in a late judicial intervention , I will watch how a man will be put to death .
when it happens and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in an audience @-@ gallery in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma state Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ sip is used by the poison injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was already for the first time in January of his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day closer , I began to fear myself .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists must see exec@@ utions in the United States , and since many more applicants are available as seats , a mac@@ er@@ ere lottery will take place to decide who will be elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who is selected who will be watching it emo@@ tionally .
I cannot do this .
I will be sitting in addition to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps of my best friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the course of the months with telephone numbers and two and a half hours .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t be allowed to take a notebook and a pin in order to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter , giving me my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the people &apos;s history as he wants and you will get access .
I regard myself with her .
she adm@@ its that it could have been better artic@@ ulate , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do .
Richard Glos@@ sip had problems with some of the things I said and written .
he does not tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he may remove me from his list of witnesses .
but he wants an international re@@ porter is present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks he will help the public relations of the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a Re@@ por@@ ter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the event , please hear the series of pod@@ casts which I have made .
I don &apos;t want to enter all details here again .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ sip is inno@@ cent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty to be a benefici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that a strong probability consists that he is not guilty of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can not claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters that you can apply for this .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man an unnecessary death die .

he headed the ste@@ wards and the Integr@@ ative Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she brought a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a racing day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive Kob@@ alt T@@ up@@ swing tasting at Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had held back 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ onage accus@@ ations and did not want it to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out how too high @-@ bearing grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

they know that it is far .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with them what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to run to the core , and I want my owners think I try my best for them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if they begin to think , I do not do this , then I should not be a trainer .
then I have to think about what I do with my license .

if this is the case , they certainly should believe in their n@@ oses , because they have failed to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , eh@@ em . Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ bs , the President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and still is today .
should I bring this to the view that it is personally ?
did the R@@ V@@ L behave behave and maybe people outside of trainers take charge of what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking out there that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say they are thinking about it now .
but I arrived at the point where I don &apos;t care , and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the senior management levels of the trainers have built up with the long @-@ long cob@@ alt investigation of Li@@ dar@@ i and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to that he could take &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ dy &apos;s best known by his preparation of the un@@ varnis@@ hed master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , the race @-@ day treatment rule is &quot; ridiculous &quot; after a pack carrier or sound had been put on the horse debate , which ble@@ w up against the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has irrit@@ ated mud on the leg .
it could have been that last night .
it could have been that day yesterday , whatever was it like that .
but it did so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy might be faced with a three @-@ im@@ ati@@ cal dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an examination of this proposition was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here it is too far gone , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy hits compete against claims on bin@@ aries
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Craig Bell@@ amy has criticism of its players as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agenda &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee will have the Storm players &quot; ring battle &quot; with his team during the high Storm winner in the qualifying finale in Sydney on Friday evening .
Brisbane Bron@@ co Trainer Way@@ ne Ben@@ nett made a hardly missed note with the Storm Team after his team had reached the Final victory against North Queensland Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; Mu@@ e@@ example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two of Queensland was not too good &quot; in w@@ rest@@ ling .
Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of its team and said that they are concentrated only on their &quot; contact &quot; in the Tac@@ na .
Bell@@ amy imp@@ lied that the criticism of two leading trainers to his team won him confident as it de@@ ts that they were worried about being hit by the Storm team .
&quot; it always appears on - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about Ring@@ fights when they had struck us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we don &apos;t have changed anything about our defensive system or techniques all year round . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kled with a real focus and this has acted as a turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not accustomed to losing it , so it was a bit of shock to him .
it &apos;s been com@@ ical , as this is always emerging at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked the idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and remembered his ment@@ or that Ben@@ net@@ ts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football . &quot;
Way@@ ne talks about exciting football .
he was watching his game on Saturday evening with our on Friday evening and how exciting her play was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in the year 2010 St George was a boring team , and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of a shock .
but now he has a team that can play and which we see as exciting , especially its young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you would like to play if you have these kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as they do .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ sters obtained a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other trials in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are Pau@@ wel@@ sen making and no points any ten@@ sion@@ ing ?
for me it is the schedules .
if they mention us , it means that in a phase we will meet them .
the Storm team won free on this weekend because they won the right to either North Queensland Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday night in the final final in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ Cau@@ tion for drug requests
a man who may possibly need a life @-@ long punishment because of his temp@@ ter , to arrive in the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine that were s@@ mug@@ gled up to Queensland was released against a deposit of 200,000 each .
Mar@@ ko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police came 100 kg of the drug on Yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America to Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and submitted to Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was watched as he met his co @-@ accused in the marina in the course of the morning and later in Café Co@@ om@@ era S@@ culp@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota response .
despite a potentially life @-@ known penalty for the attempt to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , argued the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter f@@ agan , was concerned about the threat of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he is often travelling to Serbia , &quot; stated the court on Wednesday .
in the Cri@@ tical section he lied to the police on his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vice &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a bond of 200,000 dollars as a security together to reach his release .
&quot; following reading the aff@@ id@@ ental explanations of the two people it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; said Ju@@ agan .
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to hold him off , not to appear , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and his Ser@@ b pass , res@@ ides in the police daily and is at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

Stev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g used phone of girls to cur@@ l ped@@ ophi@@ le to sending images
a ped@@ ophil@@ er used the phone of a 11 year old girl to challenge images of child abuse .
Stev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g took the phone of the girl , when this was asleep , log@@ out into an online mess@@ aging service that he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleep Ho@@ g@@ g .
she saw it through , found the confusing messages and aler@@ ted immediately their mother .
the police took care of it and looked at the five pictures , analysed computers , which were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; web research , the terms used for the search for invol@@ un@@ tary paintings of children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ g@@ g , then , claims to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and then he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre@@ tend to be a poli@@ cem@@ an to sc@@ are her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pro@@ secutor E@@ ili@@ ie Rober@@ t@@ son said the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be an addiction that he is addic@@ tive to sc@@ are people .
he adm@@ its that the Search on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was done , because he wanted to claim a poli@@ cem@@ an to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked the he to send more photos .
he said he did to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wants to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ t@@ son added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was alive and crying .
it then saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and made the accused .
the girl was interviewed and said that the indic@@ tee computer and Play@@ station used to speak with girls who saw a lot younger than he .
Ho@@ g@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment of indictment issued by children on June 14 last year , issued on January 25 this year and not to have appeared before the court appearances on 24 March this year .
def@@ ender &apos;s lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ g@@ g does not appear in the Register of sexual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; might be found in his understanding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Al@@ ist@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael dev@@ oured the judgment of October to get background reports on social work .
Ho@@ g@@ g was given in this case ( b@@ ail ) , but was held in provisional custody due to hear@@ ings to other still outstanding cases .

destro@@ user soft on small limits out@@ puts to Germany
more and more refugees are picked up at the German @-@ Austrian border from the major check@@ points .
many tro@@ users left out of fear of discovery and capture of people increasingly at smaller border dealings .
on the side of the Austrian side , I said a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police .
along the Border river Inn , Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn were picked up in the coun@@ ties of Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they were walking distance over bridges and ri@@ gs on the German side .
they are sent to us by Bundes@@ la@@ z@@ ists and passed on to registration .
at Munich &apos;s main station there was a lot more refugees following the German police station compared to the beginning of the week .
between 8@@ am and 8@@ am , there are some 700 people in the state capital , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re @-@ introduction of controls at the Franco @-@ Austrian border , on Tuesday 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the town .
Stuttgart : emig@@ ration from Tro@@ pics to &quot; Henry &quot; in the southwest
Meteor@@ ologists warn of storm @-@ ö@@ der@@ es in the South@@ west from Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area of Western Europe , warm sea air is currently taking warm air in the country , distributed to the Deutsche Wetter@@ dienst ( D@@ W@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
the vigor@@ ous Deep Purple be the prec@@ ursor of the Tro@@ pics regime &quot; Henry , &quot; which has been drawn over the Atlantic over the past few days by the Bermuda Islands .
violent storms and thunder@@ storm are expected especially in Baden .
according to D@@ W@@ D is still up to Thursday , too soon in the Black Forest , on the Schwä@@ b@@ b Al@@ b and at the Lake Con@@ sea @-@ circle with ri@@ cks of 60 to 90 km per hour .
since Friday we again take a look at the sun again .
the mass makes it : every two years the car@@ makers will show their innovations at the IA@@ A .
2015 is primarily found in the compact cars that are currently particularly well sold .
cars from the compact class are particularly in demand : around 2@@ 8,@@ 1 per cent of new appro@@ vals dropped out according to the Federal Office of the Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is also reflected in the IA@@ A ( percent@@ ages 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic conceptual standard and new luxury cars , this year mainly many new compact models are presented .
one of the biggest premi@@ er for the German auto industry is the Opel A@@ stra , which is in autumn with the dealers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the A@@ stra has been an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel Group Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann in the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the heart of the brand .
in order for the volume model also well sold , the new A@@ stra is also not much more expensive .
Opel is situated at the entrance of the greatest competitor VW Golf in view , which starts at EUR 5@@ 650 .
the current A@@ stra costs € 16 9@@ 90 .
the A@@ stra has a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 PS .
in addition , the H@@ esse offers more diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 b@@ hp to 147 kW / / 200 HP , to which for the first time also three @-@ cylinder petrol engines count .
unlike the main competitor VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel A@@ stra is initially only a fifth .
as a second version , I will follow in the spring of the comb@@ i , which is already visible on IA@@ A .
and what will the A@@ stra compete with new comp@@ actors next to the A@@ stra ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its A@@ stra ri@@ vals Mé@@ gan@@ e in the race .
at the trade fair the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only a five @-@ fifth in a conventional and an acc@@ entu@@ ated sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : quite new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan Alliance wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact , Infin@@ iti , with its curved lines , adap@@ ts itself into the design line of the brand .
the basic model is given a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 PS .
but on offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 HP or 125 kW / 170 PS .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model with petrol engines , including a newly developed 1,@@ 0 @-@ liter engine @-@ engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 horse@@ power .
the maximum torque is by manufactur@@ er@@ At 170 New@@ t@@ meters ( Nm ) .
sales start of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new , but totally renewed is the compact standard DS 4 , which is visible on IA@@ A .
internally , the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n desc@@ endant remained at the front of the front panel : here the cooler was drawn new and the changed head@@ lights with LED technology was expanded .
in the interior , the Inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment@@ system is moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons are reduced by a touch@@ screen and the first Ap@@ ples Car@@ play can be integrated .
added to the IA@@ A at IA@@ A in the compact class , a number of over@@ looks and new variants such as the Mercedes @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square @-@ meter cell are in@@ humane
the Bundes@@ verfassungs@@ gericht has rightly given an ex @-@ in@@ mate of the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary vill@@ ager , which was housed once a month in a small cell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the violation of their human dignity , prisoners have generally entitled to financial compensation , if they are in small cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that decided the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
those affected can even hope for money if they were locked in close quarters only a few days ( AZ , 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus , an ex @-@ in@@ mate with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe . he was placed in a single cell hall with approximately five square meters from June to November 2009 ; the res@@ tro@@ om was not sealed off .
afterwards the man , who at the end of his attack is now on the free foot , had been moved to a larger cell .
his official att@@ achments due to the un@@ worthy ir@@ ation conditions against the land of Berlin failed .
but the Constitutional Ju@@ dge raised the Chamber judgment of the Chamber of Appe@@ al and rejected the case for renewed examination .
you see the man of man hurt .
ex@@ termin@@ ator now determines the amount of compensation
even though , due to legal reasons , only a few days of port days for compensation are decisive for the compensation , it was given to be an equ@@ ator , called it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ating the protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chamber must now be clarified the amount of funds .
the Constitutional Ju@@ dge have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
they said only in April of a prisoner red@@ ress , because he was bare in a cell .
human un@@ worthy is a decision by 2011 according to the multip@@ lication of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , in addition to Wednesday also the Berlin Constitutional Court , which in a prisoner in a parallel in November 2009 had de@@ vised a decent housing .
the then se@@ wage @-@ pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had been accommodated for three months from 15 to 21 hours daily in a similar cell , as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons have also been in the headlines in recent weeks due to lack of personnel in the headlines .
prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ siveness rises , even to pun@@ ches , due to the tense situation has already come .
according to information from the judiciary , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of junior sho@@ ots is not occupied , 19 should 2016 fall away .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is a tremendous challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or is determined to accept her .
what is coming to Germany ?
approximately 800 000 asylum seekers are coming to Germany following forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Germany this year , according to the statement by vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated against this unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do that and we can do that . &quot;
what happens in Germany gives the following overview .
they are needed according to different forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Finance ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institute ) New Year - the next five years .
it is almost twice as much as it is built until now ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
the lack of housing but above all with affordable rents : annually , 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing out of the rental price , and around these particularly favourable apartments will also apply to refugees .
Minister Rec@@ minister@@ ing Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the promotion of currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing a year would have to rise , and this must make the federal government an advancement of 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
the scientists and the federal Minister agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing .
according to estimates by the institute for labour market research and vocational research , it is estimated that 55 percent of the refugees were working in Germany over the long term .
however , refugees in Germany would not have been systematically asked for their qualification in order to help them get started with , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Stiftung .
but for the integration of refugees it is vital if they work in Germany .
work is the key for social contacts , for the appreciation in the reception , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , &quot; says migration researcher Diet@@ rich Thr@@ us@@ hardt .
in Germany it has given a policy direction according to Thr@@ us@@ urer : from the Labour Organisation for Refu@@ ge@@ es on recognition of Labour .
while there was a work ban on asylum seekers of up to five years ago , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residents , the asylum seekers into a place .
in society - also because of the lack of skilled labour - has prevailed in the perspective that refugees should be able to gain access to the labour market faster .
a huge obstacle to access the labour market is a lack of German knowledge .
so far there is still no sufficient offer of general and job@@ specific language courses .
studies show that jobs are most often conve@@ yed by personal contacts .
the building of networks is therefore according to Thr@@ us@@ urer of the Royal Road to work integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few fle@@ ed parents give their children to the kit@@ as , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ro@@ oting parents it is only once very important to bring the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ sch@@ bar , spokes@@ person for youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , spread the management of g@@ athers in different languages .
should the need for tut@@ ors strongly increase by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would attempt to increase the training capacity - about by increasing more specialist schools .
in the countries , students will be prepared without German @-@ knowledge in welcome classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained prof@@ essors and teachers but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second @-@ pron@@ unciation .
there is no defect , says Be@@ ate St@@ agn@@ ant from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk appreci@@ ates that about 20 per cent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal land asylum seekers or ge@@ dul@@ ended study - the only exception to so far was Berlin , Dom@@ sen@@ ator Frank Hen@@ kel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; study willingness for refugees could be easier to access the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because refugees with a residence permit or b@@ ulation are not given any benefits under the asylum seeker , if they start studying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter is not given a BA@@ Fö@@ G , as they do not fall under the circle of people entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blind@@ ed persons &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tolerated refugees had to have been living in Germany for so so far to be eligible for BA@@ Fö@@ G , from 1 January 2016 to shor@@ tens this span@@ ish for 15 months .
but the funding gap must also be closed , asking for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Ber@@ lin State Secretary for Science and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
Islam will in future play a more important role in the future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually eliminate the same rights to Islam as they have the churches and develop their existing state @-@ churches right to become a new state of religions .
it would also be important to establish a Islamic welfare association , who is professionally taking care of the new arri@@ vals .
on the rights are also obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , representatives of Islam must be on clear right and ready to work with the state in many areas and to pri@@ ori@@ tise some control possibilities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also includes readiness to face viol@@ ently against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts may also be hin@@ dered by Germany .
those who wanted to au@@ stra@@ y such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said at Bay@@ rische Rund@@ funk .
he suggested to translate the Basic Law to Arabic .
integration will be a lot more in future than today a topic of society .
in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism will be squee@@ zed .
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - for a scarce decade , a non @-@ discrimination plan and a General Equality Act .
however , it is very slow to see how the NS@@ U &apos;s series showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist moti@@ f .
equal chances for all : what migrants organizations and stak@@ eholder German stakeholders call for a long time and to call for the international agreements as anti @-@ racial ri@@ dden Germany , must remain reality in the coming years , when the country remain peaceful and util@@ ise its new citizens - for the benefit of all .
generally speaking , Germany has been unable to medi@@ cally supply the refugees so far , Mr Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , Dr. Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what concerns Man@@ - Power and capacities , we create that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it must make additional money flow into the system .
to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery invites all stakeholders in the registration of the registration health cards .
delivered services could later be calculated with the federal states .
and in the long run it is highly questionable , so many people with the restricted power catalog ab@@ dic@@ ated to the asylum seeker .
otherwise , the doctors make primarily the language barriers to create .
already so far , the Berlin @-@ scientific scientist the@@ a Bor@@ de proved to be in@@ quired about their disease than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical offices , interpre@@ ters would have to be taken over , demands them .
many refugees would have helped many refugees also with more general medical conflicts in the emergency out@@ ages .
and with another diagnostic view .
among others there are a lot more un@@ traffi@@ cked persons , and with the young people it is about HIV education .
with the partial other disease pictures , German doctors are from their education but clearly , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not as hard to recognize , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what the off@@ ender is concerned , whether the refugees can be even allevi@@ ated in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans had a highly developed educational system , some refugees were even doctors .
in order to practice them , however , they would need to prove their qualifications and can take recur@@ sively once more ex@@ ams .
at least half of the refugees in Germany ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) is psych@@ ologically sick : most people suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorders or depression .
particularly vulnerable . refugee camp , explains Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , president of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study of TU Munich is that every five Syrian refugee camp is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany arrives .
he who is suffering from a post @-@ matic stress disorder , suffering from other things , is suffering so @-@ called flas@@ h@@ backs with breathing difficulty , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart ras@@ en and bla@@ zing .
more symptoms include sleep and concentration @-@ problems , strong shock and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms would be chronic , be an early treatment necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , only four percent of the psychological sick refugees receive a psycho@@ therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while mentally ill , asylum seekers can present a request for psycho@@ therapy , but the processing takes mostly several months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , in the social offices , there would usually be legal workers or doctors , which are not trained for the psychological conditions , whether or not a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are important to take away the people from their everyday life and to take them for two hours into a completely different world , &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ dering with a world @-@ city flair , &quot; said Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst concept .
50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometer long tour can now experience this flair .

&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stressed Stephan@@ ie mother , Brig@@ itte Pro@@ bst .
griev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus are only too often subject to various animal protection organizations .
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes position : &quot; is it not good for our animals , it is also not good for us . &quot;
some 80 animals from five different continents have enjoyed each str@@ ing@@ unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ legged arti@@ stes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they are lovingly called is the possibility of any wish from the eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the ring .

Sim@@ bab@@ y@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , down the staircase at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of this case quickly became the social media .
the opening of the Parliament has also dist@@ res@@ sed with claims of members of the opposition that they would have received anonymous death @-@ threats and they were warned previously , to accompany the address of Mr Mu@@ gabe with bugs .
last month they had b@@ lown him and during his speech to the State of the nation in the parliament - this is the speech which he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ esis said that seven op@@ positions policy@@ makers have received SMS messages on their mobile phones that they warned before them to dis@@ rupt the Mu@@ gabe .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists writing to Mu@@ gabe .
it warns US members that immunity in the Parliament and once they leave parliament , parliamentary immunity are no longer effective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said the party who run by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30,000 stations
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will probably build 25,000 to 30.000 jobs in the context of restructuring and saving efforts at the company &apos;s services .
HP is later posted in two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected job super@@ structure is leading to a load of more than $ 2.7 billion , from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation .
&quot; this restructuring measures will allow a more competitive , more sustainable cost @-@ structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive Officer , which should lead the unity to the separation .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today , and we have a broad and deepening portfolio of shops that supports companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as a separate company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual revenue and will be focused on providing in@@ calcul@@ ator , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; says a statement by the company .
it spl@@ its a company that was founded in the 1930@@ s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard , which is called the hometown of Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has passed a massive restructuring to tackle the home@@ coming from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the biggest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field that is based on the conviction that a close focused company can perform better performance .
FC arsen@@ al @-@ captain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates have to stand before the game against dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the ver@@ end Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ised to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and provided his rehabilitation according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play before Christmas again .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss the next four games for England and in view of its history , its participation in the European Championship is certainly still uncertain .
the big shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had stopped the last season after a separate kno@@ ck@@ ingly and then returned to its old swing during the pres@@ eas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury is not threatening the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ ess . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone which is not good .
it is not a greater matter .
this was only an accident .
it was not in connection with his knees , or with his wounds he previously had .
that may be true of pure medical view , but like Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the per@@ tin@@ ent danger of further injury , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it is also developing a uncomfortable pattern .
Premier In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has had 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of arsen@@ als 15@@ 7 Lig@@ ans in the past five game times .
the wider image for arsen@@ al is that they were in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League clubs , who have recorded most of her injury .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury of injury will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a delay period , a time in which you must strengthen your body and win explosive force , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body is stabil@@ ised , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
arsen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ ers Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on the next Wednesday and Wen@@ ger presents itself a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta is likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start using K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of night@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give players who need it to be a minor break @-@ up , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
although Arsenal are clear favor@@ ites , passing through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the places with the biggest intimi@@ date effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign launched in the last season .
the stadium was shaken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake where on the Richter scale 3.@@ 2 was measured .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that arsen@@ al has held the teaching of the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and will be driven by far @-@ reaching hope , with its management the association to its first Europ@@ ap@@ ocr@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked at arsen@@ al .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m far enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ feast : the com@@ edy show that gives us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for males to open up , now even doub@@ t@@ ful than ever before , as shown by su@@ icide in young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high .
it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to address the issue , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ reli@@ ve ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a w@@ ret@@ ched life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to seek help if they need it .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of over 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms introduced that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with a healthy atmosphere , &quot; his chances of recovery has doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , hal@@ ved a circle of mentally healthy friends the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends with that a friendship may function .
in the age of media @-@ led communication , with its focus on style on substance , the in@@ denti@@ ability of the reply is often more important than a major contact .
our digital life have the need to be strong , li@@ vable and successful to appear , even if in reality dominates the isolation .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists pre@@ dict extr@@ ic values ; money , image , social status , all at expense in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game , inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy .
the Schön@@ e near Friends proved that this focuss@@ ing was placed on the head .
every character was not defined by his work , but defined by his personality , who g@@ lowed through the interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequently hu@@ gs , moments on foot@@ ball@@ ers in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross after Rachel - all this came out of the knowing that men can relate to it , even if they often come back to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of telephone care said to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and endangered in su@@ ici@@ dal , has really shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not able to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come up with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if it is possible to talk about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term ri@@ cular mechanisms .
it clearly presents the little moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so very my objective out@@ sider status over the telephone to look at the people in moments of despair may also help long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why don &apos;t you take your friends to have a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or even better , if you can see in Star@@ bu@@ cks anyone alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what the difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from start to finish - all 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ feast
di Mary meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malmö
angel Di Maria goes with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and the son of Cav@@ ani after his place against Malmö .
di Mary meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malmö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Tab@@ son Cav@@ ani kept a course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ ce@@ car stadium closed on Tuesday started .
di Mary met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G players who brought the French master to the way , but afterwards they passed a number of opportunities before they finally lifted up their lead , when Cav@@ ani achieved a hot ball@@ ad at the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A , Paris needs a strong launch against the Swedish Masters , since they are not only striving for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but improving on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ alen in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , there was no stere@@ pieces of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vice team missed opportunities in front of the gate . he later started in the game against his hometown team and against the association with which he started his illustr@@ ator career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore it is a good start to gain 2 : 0 to cause our opponents to cause problems and to look relaxed , even if there are certain things we have yet to perf@@ ecting over the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we wanted to win and we won , although I regret we have not reached one or two more gates . &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned after his injury in one of three modifications to the Paris Team , which was on the weekend a 2 : 2 oun@@ tain@@ ted to his place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was released in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ in@@ ean wing was described as the man who took the PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , when he walked in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why , when he was in Marco Ver@@ rat Pass behind the Malmö defence , before he Johan Wil@@ and passed over to the long corner of the network .
if however someone believed that PS@@ G would win a big win that was disappointed .
Malmö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off hit to reach this level , occurred at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was aged with a five @-@ man defence and two low in the middle field become a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot from Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who escal@@ ates far to Kevin Tr@@ apps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G becomes sometimes on , with some patches and bad connections , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic who were pat@@ rolled in the first half in no less than five trials alone , after Cav@@ ani had appointed him after rest@@ art@@ ing .
nevertheless he dis@@ missed a lot more skill than he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic who turned Di Mary in a rotation that was going to pass on the pole position in the 5@@ 2nd minute ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hour brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er had thus achieved his sixth position after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all thoughts of Malmö in the game might come back , and only an excellent input from Wil@@ and out of no distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could hold the final result low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi became a gate at the end .
the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , gave later that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year last year .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which did not have the same level .
the qualification boxes are not sufficient . &quot;
guard from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European Champion X@@ avi is playing in summer 2015 for the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club in Qatar
the FC Bayern obviously faced some years ago just before the commitment of Spain &apos;s Super@@ star X@@ avi , who at that time played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times po@@ cal@@ dera , four times Champions League winner , two times the Club World Champion , two times European champion , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in summer the meanwhile 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and joined the al @-@ S@@ add sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi reveals that he was already standing before the start of EM in front of Barcelona .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we told me that Bar@@ ça wants to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything , we do nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered office of FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was a offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ saw wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to remember : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ ge took over the FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi was not inter@@ changed
but the change did not come about .
and the determining man for this now works for the German record master : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken under contract Gu@@ ardi@@ ola and I have played a great EM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he cannot imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so he threw me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ onne &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 have been running with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ finals of the Champions League against the Adriatic across the entire distance on the lawn , switched the Red from ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the top of the royal classes .
Matt Dam@@ on plays variety in movies to create
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ted the af@@ ro@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown while discussing the variety and said they are not needed behind the scenes .
as a result of Sunday Night of H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light broke up the experienced actor Brown , when he emphas@@ ised the need for alternative vision and in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about diversity , then do it during the occupation of the film and not during the occupation of the show &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; insured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted , with ins@@ ul@@ ting un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian is focuss@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the production of Benjamin Dis@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss about the show @-@ fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to call people to reflect on it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of harmony , &quot; Brown first .
the only black person , and she is a nut@@ shell that is beaten by her white fe@@ ather .
the producer of De@@ ar White People stands up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kr@@ isten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on acknowledged that their direc@@ ting &quot; at the end could give us something what we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast@@ ed , the Social Media recently explo@@ des dis@@ approval via Dam@@ on Com@@ ments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger in the clip that he wrote &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain her diversity - this is SO KNOW that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et served more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 sor@@ kes since its publication .
Dam@@ on Com@@ ments shall come at a time when exact wind representation in the media is at the forefront of the social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white poli@@ cem@@ an , the movement of Black lives has been crus@@ hed across the nationwide acting and pressing legis@@ lators and authorities , discrimin@@ atory practices against colored impacts .
in February the singer , Prince , made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the recorded albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; albums still weaker , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Black lives Mat@@ ter published an explanation and in response to the question of the Fox @-@ News @-@ personality of Elisabeth Has@@ en@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hatred group .
&quot; the network Black lives Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the guides .
recently , announced that Dam@@ on was standing on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ees , producers and media moti@@ le , invited to visit the Pope to discuss the portra@@ yal of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope , is unclear .
&apos; American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; kr@@ ön@@ t first champion
Pro Sport@@ clim@@ bers and operating relief Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero has been the first athlete to win the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took the Grand Prix of 1 million $ .
the competition show , which completed just their 7th season , had never seen a competition participants , who finished all steps of his hind@@ ran@@ ce course .
during the season , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , until the Fin@@ als .
climbing to the last task was climbing to a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
B@@ ritten ended the task at the time when he was the first athlete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 by American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge for three seconds more quickly , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard fight won , still under shock on winning the Great price of 1 million $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it is amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than 10,000 $ or life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! over his whole bunch of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so all of a sudden ... as I can not even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
Executive producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood porter to discuss the finals and why B@@ ritten , although he was first finished at all the circuit , won &apos;t get any prize money .
according to the rules the money is going to the fastest .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , he gets the one at the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
how very the money is a wonderful price and life changes , he receives the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he will have any kind .
he is so happy to have done what he did .
crowds of awards received from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , I am glad that Isaac is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt equally when they sw@@ apped the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or was extended for a eighth season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 .

the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as Spo@@ iler , but the part played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 at target Field .
the T@@ wins did a chance to climb within a play of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League of Wild@@ Card Square .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of three letter F @-@ word which was so hard to grasp on a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all the victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad &apos;s .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon was holding his early offensive support when Detroit dot@@ ted three times in the first two lines , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth place .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed 6 times in the 1 / 3 inner and made three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year very strongly , &quot; said Simon .
it &apos;s hard to throw at bull@@ seye every game and therefore I want to go deeply into the game .
the @-@ designed tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Martin@@ ez had three results and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Martin@@ ez , since then he had four hits on the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has put the head@@ wood well , &quot; said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the shoulder @-@ weight training ) , looked much better at the Bull@@ pics , and brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the h@@ ind at the end of the seventh time , the T@@ wins had its best chance to get back into the game .
centre Fiel@@ d@@ B@@ yron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
Right Fiel@@ ds of Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a bun@@ ks , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian do@@ cian to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran down , the only man with whom he was faced , before the R@@ ookie Uni@@ ok@@ ie Miguel S@@ ano , who casts a two @-@ run fro@@ m@@ hagen on the right @-@ handed dirt .
with a pair of runners and the completion of the second brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ling to a Double Play .
it was the major League &apos;s premi@@ er league for 27 events in this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe proposed double play .
after Detroit added at the end of the ninth place an Insurance @-@ Run , put a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed stand Sh@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth save .
Detroit offered the pr@@ el@@ ude to the game of one still un@@ movable Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers made three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed people , which had been rep@@ ain@@ ted before the game of the injury list , after having been missing for more than a month because of a back .
&quot; obviously , not the beginning I wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I found and sen@@ sed that I would create some pretty good pit@@ As in the third inning . &quot;
after finishing in the first the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter , H@@ uss@@ g gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out Walk for J.@@ D. Martin@@ ez brought Victor Martin@@ ez in the game , run a single &quot; up the &quot; festival &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Martin@@ ez finished his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos was followed by a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Martin@@ ez was thrown out of the game as he tried to get to the third what the threat ended .
the Tig@@ ers laid in the second , one one @-@ out double of Cat@@ cher James McC@@ ann and a two @-@ out single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ ds Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he was not particularly well beaten , but he got the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the reloc@@ ating right @-@ handed A.@@ I.@@ A@@ ser .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es it came to three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
note : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ chez is divided because of a violation of the wor@@ ship@@ pers .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who performed the shoulder of San@@ chez in 2007 .
San@@ chez , since the middle of August on the injury list due to a shoulder @-@ version , is scheduled to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is removed from the vulner@@ ability list to start the win &apos;s win .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was purchased in the exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing for a break in the right hip since the 20th August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games at target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ER@@ A ) is playing against min@@ is@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees shall be subject in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees has been on their way to Hessen .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the an@@ passed people in Wiesbaden are then to be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters , as the city of Wiesbaden on the evening evening .
they are counting from 450 to 750 an@@ coming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for such case in the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily happen there .
they will then be re @-@ distributed to other municipalities .
in the past ten days , according to the government officials responsible for the first @-@ up government , G@@ ießen 7@@ 500 people had arrived in Hessen .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also have facilities for the large number of refugees in sports halls .
Isch@@ g : German military action in Syria
the Director of Munich &apos;s Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that thinking about military action options should not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he threw the European states to be collective &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the cup of a military involvement in Germany has passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends on our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutsch@@ land@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German Ambassador in Washington also demanded a massive increase of international aid for refugees .
Austria controlled at the southern and eastern borders
in Germany , Austria has again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Interior of Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained the evening @-@ evening in the Austrian television station OR@@ F , after Hungary no one will be sent back .
also Germany did not send refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement on which Germany could take a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , I have already given such discussions between the Director @-@ General for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
concrete figures discussed it and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
over the last few days tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria on the so @-@ called Bal@@ ans route from Hungary to Austria .
your target is mostly Germany .
chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and their Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ man applied for a special summit meeting with several other EU heads of state and government a special summit for next week .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states have so far not been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis .
the EU @-@ interior ministers intend to take on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting on a binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees .
in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support the federal states more strongly in the first @-@ up and distribution of people .
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , Angela announced on the late afternoon after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Minister at the chan@@ cell@@ or in Berlin .
Merkel underlined that people who need protection , complain that too .
but he who have no lead perspective could also not stay in Germany too .
this view was historically shared in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with an &quot; enormous effort of effort . &quot;
thousands of desper@@ ate refugees stuck in the Balkan route now .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres long border to Serbia on the night .
a few hours later the government announced that the border reached Romania with a fence .
this neighbouring country is unlike Serbia in the EU .
Hungary plans to prevent the tu@@ gs of fresh@@ water over Romania , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government condemned the plan immediately .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who were cut through the fence .
in Turkey , meanwhile , thousands of migrants repor@@ tedly were on the path to the Greek border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; spac@@ ecraft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ ass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can find an ocean on satur@@ n moon En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the E@@ isp@@ an@@ zer of the Satur@@ n@@ mon@@ ds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us s@@ app@@ t a global ocean .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these include researchers from observations of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ ass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , the moon is easily rolled on its way around the Ring@@ plan@@ ers .
this exchange movement is only small , but still too big for a visible cel@@ estial body , it is in a communication of Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state of New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers present their analysis in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; sheet .
even longer it was known that there must be under the ice sheet of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us liquid water .
thus , &quot; C@@ ass@@ ini &quot; had already been discovered ov@@ ic@@ ans on the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ mon@@ ds , the water vap@@ or and iron particles , thereby feeding the so @-@ called e @-@ ring of the Saturn .
at least at the south @-@ pole there must be an underground sea , they closed the astronom@@ ers back then .
the expansion of the hidden ocean has however not been cleared .
Ram@@ atha is missing in 18@@ 60 Munich several weeks
the 18@@ 60 Munich needs to rel@@ inqu@@ ish around one month on the Spanish soldier Val@@ det Rama .
an investigation has issued an investigation of an Ad@@ duc@@ tor in the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association shared .
Ram@@ ah had compl@@ ained about pain in the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich &apos;s lions , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is anticipated four weeks of forced break @-@ break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this makes us hard , Rama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we have to think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sports Director Nec@@ at Ay@@ ar@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view of the potential obligation of un@@ iting professionals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a training mast , the six@@ ties , however , at first presented a defensive .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was used earlier at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at currently have the opportunity to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tor@@ j@@ äger Rub@@ in O@@ ko@@ tie can return to team training after his bra@@ king course next week .
even on Thursday the Austrian National Team is supposed to get into the run training .
O@@ ko@@ tie had been injured in the Parti@@ e near Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) in a strong collapse at the head .
but contrary to his first fear he remained without a serious bl@@ ur .
no diet @-@ fruit - man@@ goes contain lots of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but those who wish to take care of their slim line will often get out of them rather .
because Man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar - especially sac@@ ral .
however , the exotic fruits are nevertheless : in them B vitamins and the vitamins E and C. above all included man@@ goes but a lot of vitamin A and its pre @-@ level beta @-@ K@@ aro@@ tin .
who e@@ ats the fruits thus supports the ey@@ esi@@ ght , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
during the purchase man@@ goes should not be too soft or too tight and smell .
the form@@ work colour alone does not tell about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste much delicious .
you should store at room temperature and eat within a few days .
then they naturally taste pure or sweet food .
but a man@@ go gives also hearty dishes a special note .
it mild the slightly bitter taste man@@ cher leaf sal@@ ads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits perfectly with fish , chicken , lamb and game .

on Wednesday and at night the F@@ öh@@ n leaves some time with storm @-@ volume due to the com@@ promis@@ si@@ ties .
after the com@@ promis@@ ingly on Thursday morning , it crosses us a striking sound @-@ front , that brings more powerful rainf@@ alls , wind turbines and a temperature back@@ slide .
like met@@ e@@ o@@ News in a communication message , Switzerland is currently on the front of a comprehensive low @-@ pressure spread over the British islands in a strong south @-@ western direction .
on the u@@ et@@ board side breaks the night to Wednesday the F@@ öh@@ n passes the valleys .
in the episode of the F@@ öh@@ n until Thursday morning in the com@@ promis@@ ism with bad@@ gers of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in Ur@@ i &apos;s country , partly also with over 100 km / h .
the hairdryer can penetrate to the bor@@ dering centre , and in the mountains are possible or@@ bo@@ xes of over 120 km / h .
while in the north on Wednesday the Roman F@@ öh@@ n is rising from 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins at the Alp@@ ens@@ ü@@ pf@@ hillside .

overall , South of the Alps must be counted to the next 48 hours with some over 100 lit@@ res of rain per square meter , this after the last days there are large amounts of rain .

Rome now has a Martin Luther &apos;s place
almost 500 years after the Reformation , he now has a Martin @-@ Luther seat .
in the presence of Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino on Wednesday a previously known nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was bap@@ tised to the name of the German Reform@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park lies in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the naming was applied by the work community of the Protestant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded the Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es became over centuries as a minority often only in hiding their faith .
the place symboli@@ zes the tradition of Christian faith in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was held as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the turn@@ around 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he found the city as a sin@@ ner sin@@ den@@ ba@@ bel .
his negative impressions are likely to have encouraged him to view historians in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the spl@@ itting of the oc@@ ci@@ dental Church with his theses .
Hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ pl@@ ated ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main pieces , the Ot@@ mar Alt for his bi@@ ble .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post has written the introduction and the Bible tex@@ te .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which is now released with gorgeous pictures .
in the beginning , the picture was formulated for Ot@@ mar Old , which in 150 moti@@ fs formulated his very personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has obtained the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; images .
on the contrary : the respective themes can be adapted , it can really be quite dark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; approximately three years , Oth@@ mar Alt in his bi@@ ble project , for which he has made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many topics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book of all books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are cycles that are subject to themes such as cru@@ st@@ as , pl@@ agues , Comm@@ and@@ ments , or father@@ land .
in this way he already fascinated several partners : this is true of the Luther n@@ publisher with its the@@ ological orientation , as well as for the Kettler @-@ publisher with its emphasis on art books .
and since it is above all the author Klaus Al@@ te@@ y , who is focuss@@ ed on the painting with the respective Bible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible points in the case of Ot@@ mar Alt , and translated into current relationships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of al@@ ts painting .
we are embedded between the original Bible county of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who wrote about his very personal thoughts in the respective situation .
the jewelry band has Golden Let@@ ters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old equ@@ ates twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of intimacy .
emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protestant religious order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the education happened already with the Rohr@@ stock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to postp@@ one this to keep me back with the Lord Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his second concern be that art is again in much greater importance again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perception of ima@@ gery is marked by advertising today and which is loud . &quot; &quot; &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being pushed out there .
artists have a different desire and glad@@ ness , to show things .
images always have a bit of secrecy and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a dinosau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt would like the spect@@ ator to let the images go down , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let them appear , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image looks for his counter@@ part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post ki@@ cked at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; has always been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art , &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
old have not been given to what the Bible has to be seized , but the most important ones for him .
&quot; this was no collaboration on eye level , &quot; says Al@@ te@@ post : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text merely explained . &quot; emerged is a picture @-@ Bible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Luther n@@ publisher , this work is an invitation to deepen his life easier and to find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts images speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas @-@ wall pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Foundation .
construction work for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn ( BM@@ X )
plans made , place found , company mand@@ ates , excav@@ ation for a round course model : one year later , almost everything was done - but still before the official opening of the BM@@ X train was the end .
om@@ is@@ sions in politics and the administration was ad@@ min@@ ted by the residents , above all among the residents , which the train did not want to be patient .
thus hills de@@ ported to new place - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval will enter in October , the first council of the Sab@@ ine Mo@@ se@@ bach @-@ Bo@@ ck could now communicate in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year has not yet happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further intent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with working in the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensified commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to the refugees until 2019 , and the Bundesliga are showing a clear sign on the German Bundesliga .
the soccer re@@ acts to the changing situation in Germany and secur@@ es its help in tackling the related problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no one I can say , that &apos;s not about me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to get this topic under control , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ B , Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel , on 23 September in Berlin , he plans to discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday at the chan@@ cell@@ or and enter the state of State in Mrs Ber@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , he certainly will play a central role &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the soccer can and wants to help .
but the decisive ordination must be policy .
the German football ( soccer ) has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &apos; 1 : 0 for a welcome &apos; by four years .
&quot; on the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we ensured that this programme will continue until 2019 , &quot; stated Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A Meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
also some Bundes@@ lig@@ ists support this program .
already at this weekend the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ hide a clear sign when taking on the left @-@ hand strike instead of the otherwise usual sponsor@@ logos ( Her@@ mes ) the imprint &quot; We will help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ her Sport@@ s@@ é of the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and drew the project as &quot; a matter of course . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee deal is every one , nobody is allowed to see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we can use soccer ball , no , we must use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig , speaking of a &quot; prominent banner of the League . &quot;
by the EM @-@ Quali@@ fication game against Hungary on this Friday the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach drew the support of refugees as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great collective work of German football &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 roy@@ alties would have launched in their own projects would be great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are so active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which we have spent , will live in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this and the next year the association collabor@@ ates with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government at 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the associations have already called up the whole sum of 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP management chief loses an eye on the disaster
the President of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has repor@@ tedly affected left eye to several reports , according to a down@@ fall early July .
with the accident at the stair@@ way in the building of his brother in the USA he was after midnight on a water glass , which he carried in the left hand reports , reports the &quot; economic week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is nearly ble@@ ed , he was power@@ less , and then brought home tow@@ ed to the road - which he told us so last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP @-@ co @-@ founder and asso Plat@@ onic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t might follow his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet in Wall@@ dorf &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meeting at Wall@@ dorf &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 54 year old manager is at the meeting and &quot; fully functioning . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday swe@@ ep ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will keep the software group .
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP there , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , it comm@@ utes between Germany and the US , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is important to go to the public with such personal history , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is important to stand up again if you please . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except for skir@@ mish ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ ter@@ ned an appropriate photo and explained that he suffered from the wheel as he bu@@ ked by the wheel .
thus he comes with leaving Singapore as little as a reservoir for the two ordinary shares of Fernando Al@@ onso and Jen@@ son Button , just like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
soccer : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes placed on a com@@ eback from Marco Re@@ us in the first board@@ game of the European League will definitely be sm@@ ashed .
the national player is missing the championship leader of the football team in the Du@@ el with the FK Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot draw on him unfortunately , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ck@@ les on Wednesday .
whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach has been open , &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
given the high load on its professionals , Tu@@ ck@@ les will not only change his ancest@@ or position on the Re@@ us position .
so he announced a change on the door@@ keeper .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of the tribal &quot; Roman Bür@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he exercises on a total top level , &quot; praised the Football teacher to the World Champion .
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the future will be used in all Europe league games , Tu@@ ck@@ les let him open .
in high probability he will also dispute the second game .
the former statement by fellow @-@ players Re@@ us that the final entry must be at the BV@@ B in the Europe League , sees Middle @-@ player Julian W@@ eig@@ l for understandable : &quot; this makes Marco not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to take the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robo@@ tics cars : government acts as a pioneer for Germany
in Germany , according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be at the forefront when changing the car .
the Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategic paper from the house of Verkehrs@@ Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things fores@@ ees investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ ations IA@@ A of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobile era &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the automated and connected road will increase traffic safety and ensure less stress , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t .
he wants to discuss the subject with his counter@@ part from the G@@ 7 states , who at the IA@@ A also meet with representatives of the industry .
the Strategic Treasury preser@@ ves the importance of the mobile broad@@ band construction and a high @-@ level increase in digital radio .
for the testing of new technology a test circuit is currently being on the 9 Highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risk &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to review the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and where needed to adapt to the new developments &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , Germany wants to use approximately internationally for achieving the permitted maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 h@@ h .
moreover , the federal government wants to stand up for a change in the Vienna Convention which has so far only fores@@ ees people as a driver .
automated driving takes an increasing extent the car takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that may collect the environment and process the data in seconds .
after a trial presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways up to 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , cars must be expected on public streets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far to 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value chain in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions on the site of Germany value the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around € 8.@@ 4 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital connectivity of the P@@ k@@ ws can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD traffic police &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ itting Bar@@ to@@ l &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the issue of liability for cases and the security of the personal data of the drivers must be clarified in a clear way .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are scep@@ tical - a lot more than French or Americans .
a survey of the For@@ sa clan on behalf of the For@@ sa clan came to the conclusion that only eight percent of the Germans believe that self @-@ genome cars will assert themselves in the next ten years , 32 percent do not believe in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in this .
in France 21 percent of the surve@@ yed surve@@ yed cars have increased by 20@@ 25 in the US 33 percent .
in any case , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely on a self @-@ driven vehicle .
after a survey of digital transformation , only seven percent would agree to be in control during the entire trip on all roads .
on the highway , the traffic could still envis@@ age at least 15 percent in flowing traffic , in St@@ au 45 percent .
well every fourth , the car would not leave control under any circumstances .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant
it is a blend of very big fashion show and a wax @-@ free gr@@ in@@ der : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work in Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : mannequ@@ ins , that thanks to video@@ projection , exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ bly human .
they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , which was among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and with it that he stuck to men in skirts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant H@@ der Haute Cou@@ ture because I have wh@@ ist@@ led hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before , it was common , now it is genuine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From 18 September to the cat@@ walk ) , which is visible from the 18th September to the Kuns@@ thalle of the HY@@ PO @-@ Kulturstiftung , it is a good fortune that the Mo@@ des@@ h@@ ö@@ pper changed his initially back@@ rest stance to a look over his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was , on the contrary , for : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you get into the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made in Montreal in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ t .
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely published work of the man , which has written fashion history , without ever having an education .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is a beautifully chore@@ ographic overall work that was run for a lot of effort : to fr@@ ise the dolls , for example , unique style was committed .
14 tons of material brought the movers according to specifications of the curator Thierry @-@ Maxime L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
just before the start of the legend , there was still a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a leather tro@@ users out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even Gau@@ l@@ men &apos;s old te@@ ddy is to be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , delicate fashion @-@ attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and poorly dressed in football ) he had attracted his Te@@ ddy B@@ HS and clothing , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
with a doll to play , his parents could not have allowed him .
the dis@@ assemb@@ ling of fashion then later changed into himself .
he st@@ umps and saw the dra@@ fts of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich , told .
later I bought it , of course .
he did not have to pay the mod@@ els for his first own fashion show .
they didn &apos;t get anything but were allowed to keep the clothes ...
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze as fashion @-@ niche
previously it was about the long nit@@ el@@ presses in and about di@@ gest@@ ing about a meter .
the embro@@ i@@ dered substances and tops have emerged in large quantity for customers , which they processed , for example , to blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of Black@@ boards , Pl@@ ust .
instead , fashion is again important .
in early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze , fashion has played a larger role , was then pushed through the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lindustrie and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt names some examples : top in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and with regional costumes .
actually , the so @-@ called vintage @-@ fashion , which re@@ jects themselves to past styles , a higher order for damage .
whoever serves no niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
in cooperation with nine other companies , Mo@@ st@@ air pl@@ ough is a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they are allowed to carry the protected label .
some 80 percent of the sales have been broken off in the last 15 years .
private and trading stores and the wholesale trade are almost no longer available .
our products can hardly reach the customer on this path .
mass ware today in the Asian region become much cheaper and almost exclusively distributed via chains .
moreover , weak@@ ling export , current to Russia and to the USA .
enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score through environmental awareness , such as Cord@@ ula Bauer by the nitrogen in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since that year we lead a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially toler@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the used materials . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Snow@@ berger Tob@@ acco at the West@@ on University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the faculty for applied art - and specializes in embro@@ ider@@ ies and tops .
to counter the competition from the Asian region , one needs to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and factories , especially economically ones &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design often only varies slightly to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago textile designs in Kat@@ i Re@@ uter rec@@ u@@ dder the historical snow@@ ball top .
at the same time , the machine is embro@@ iled on some places of small kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener gold tank master@@ ed in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was not able to start with the traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they use the whis@@ k tip for their jewelry .
in an elaborate process , it forms the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify themselves with the topic of pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
she also supplies the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Pl@@ chew@@ ing and surroundings and who like a mem@@ ento .
so I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador to the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
&quot; &quot; &quot; legends should not be stir@@ red , but Disney W@@ ays to a new film of his classics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to &quot; Entertainment Weekly , &quot; however , it is not a new movie , but rather a kind of continuation which plays 20 years after the first film with the magic n@@ anny .
the experience of the N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins in more than 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the director already says : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ to the Woods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI urges them to open the economy more broader to the world
the economy must open itself wider to the outside to promote growth , &quot; said President X@@ i Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group that was commissioned with the governance of the reform .
&quot; China should propose to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business operations , &quot; he said in a speech in the 16th session of the Central leadership group for the deepening of a comprehensive reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new land@@ ups to promote and reforms will boost new momentum and vitality , and offer new place for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ i said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list for regulating the market access , relaxation of the border controls policy , promotion of state controls ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the local population .
after the statement , a neg@@ ativity will be compiled , the sectors and companies identified for investment not to be questioned .
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programmes .
the initiative is of significance , since it indicates the market a greater role in the healing of resources , guaranteeing an illegal business environment and designed the market more open , &quot; said the statement .
the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the companies and make sure that companies decide how they manage their business .
the statement also stated that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border business operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
opening operations in an offer , state controlled sectors , additional areas will be opened to private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policies towards foreign investments and will provide the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is made easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit , or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; requ@@ esting the demands and be facilitated by the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and pro@@ secut@@ ors , has also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders like Li@@ u Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as was reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double the mer@@ cury column in predat@@ ory fishing
the European Commission wants to double the border values for mer@@ cury in large predat@@ ory fishing and thus consumers a significantly higher dose of nerves .
the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , which is an appropriate work paper of the EU , critici@@ zed the plans sharp : &quot; risks and side effects missing - and environmental policies , with full power to pregnant and infants , &quot; stated Matthias Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt by F@@ ood@@ watch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt shall say that the threshold values of the nerve @-@ poison@@ ous for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be raised by an on two milli@@ gram mer@@ cury each kilo@@ gram . &quot; &quot; &quot;
large predat@@ ors are already so strongly stra@@ ined with mer@@ cury that are not allowed to be sold at the basis of the even valid border values around 50 per cent of the fold .
after dou@@ bling of the threshold values then only 14.@@ 5 percent would be im@@ penetr@@ able .
in return for this relaxation , the EU wants to watch F@@ ood@@ watch the limit values in other fish of currently 0,5 milli@@ gram to tigh@@ ten up to 0.@@ 1 milli@@ gram Mercury per kilo@@ gram .
F@@ ood@@ watch conf@@ ers this as &quot; trick &quot; because small cem@@ eter@@ ies , like car@@ p , are usually so low @-@ charged , that they already stick to the planned maximum values already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distr@@ action that helps business alone &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mercury is a source of poison@@ ous metal metal , which is strongly influenced across the food chain , especially in predat@@ ory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small amounts can cause particularly in the inj@@ uri@@ ous injuries of the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Ministry of Health explains on his homepage with regard to the current maximum @-@ values , but that an &quot; health haz@@ ard to the general population &quot; is not to be expected .
Mercury is primarily driven through coal @-@ combustion in the environment .
according to a written information of the Federal Ministry of Finance , the German coal power station Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ ram has more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total amount in Germany .
the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish approximately in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube are &quot; permanent and nationwide , &quot; had the &quot; Spiegel &quot; in March of the paper .
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings before mer@@ cury in fish are already among the common health risks in the EU @-@ War@@ n@@ system RA@@ SF@@ F .
