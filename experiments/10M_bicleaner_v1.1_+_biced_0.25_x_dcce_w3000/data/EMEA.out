this document is a summary of the European public administration report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the Committee for Human@@ therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies conducted on recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
if you need further information on your illness or their treatment , please refer to the package unit ( also component of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or a pharmac@@ ist .
for more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg mel@@ ting tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , as solution to income ( 7.5 mg / ml ) and as an injection resolution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ ing thinking and speakers , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or sight of things , which are not present ) , distr@@ ust and del@@ usions ; • Bi@@ polar disorder , a psychological disorder , in which patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of ab@@ normal up@@ set ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood .
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate @-@ he@@ avier man@@ ic episodes and to prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed in the past to the drug .
inj@@ ecting solution is applied for quick control of irrit@@ ated un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al dysfunction if the oral intake of the medication is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution to the one or the m@@ elt @-@ coated tablets are used in patients who are preparing the gor@@ ges of tablets .
in patients who are taking besides other medicines that are just as abili@@ fy , the dose of abili@@ fy should be adapted .
this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells among each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol probably appears especially as a &quot; partial Ag@@ onist &quot; for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also ser@@ ot@@ onin ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in a lesser extent than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters appear to activate the recept@@ ors .
da D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin with schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , elimin@@ ating psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and their re@@ occur will be prevented .
abili@@ fy the effectiveness of prob@@ abili@@ fy , the re@@ occur of symptoms , was examined in three trials over to a year .
the effectiveness of inj@@ ecting solution has been compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia or similar diseases resulting in mat@@ ured un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
in another study , abili@@ fy over twelve weeks at 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in a different study the efficacy of abili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo that re@@ occur to 160 patients in which the some symptoms were already stabil@@ ised by abili@@ fy .
the effectiveness of abili@@ fy inj@@ ecting solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered in gest@@ ated un@@ rest , compared with the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies the change in symptoms of patients by a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to treatment examined .
the company also carried out studies in order to investigate how the body uses the mel@@ ting @-@ coated tablets and the solution to rep@@ airing .
in the two studies with the inj@@ ecting location , patients who received prob@@ fy in doses of 5,25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significant stronger reduction in symptoms gest@@ ed un@@ rest than patients who received a plac@@ ebo .
in applying for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , abili@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ term studies have more effective than plac@@ ebo .
abili@@ fy also has more effective than plac@@ ebo for up to 74 weeks as plac@@ ebo the re@@ occur man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was additionally administ@@ ered to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses are also more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms inf@@ eri@@ red un@@ rest and were similar effectively as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side @-@ effects of abili@@ fy for income ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ yr@@ am@@ id@@ ale interference ( un@@ nec@@ kl@@ ess ) , locking , nau@@ tical secre@@ tion ( increased sali@@ va ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ ability ) and anxiety .
the committee for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) worked at the conclusion that the advantages of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia and the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes , and in which the man@@ ic episodes aimed at treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , compared to the risks .
in addition , the Committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of inj@@ ecting un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al dysfunction in patients with schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar disorder , if a oral therapy is not suitable to over@@ balance the risks .
June 2004 the European Commission granted the Group of Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . approval for the transport of abili@@ fy in the whole European Union .
abili@@ fy is for the treatment of moderate to heavy man@@ ic episodes in the bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients displayed , the mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes aimed at treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of prob@@ abili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a focal dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of the meals .
increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended initial dose for abili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of the meals as a mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients over 65 years has not been proven .
having regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group should be considered a lower initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ Indu@@ tor is dism@@ issed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the appearance of su@@ icide @-@ social behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after switching to a anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder no increased su@@ icide ris@@ iko with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to other anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be applied with caution in patients with well @-@ known car@@ di@@ ovascular Diseases , galvan@@ izing disorders , hy@@ po@@ etic disease , hy@@ po@@ vol@@ a@@ emia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hy@@ po@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with ble@@ eding drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acc@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ed form ) .

if treated with prob@@ abili@@ fy patients there are signs and symptoms of a spont@@ ane@@ ity , should be considered to reduce the dose or dis@@ rupt the treatment .
if a patient emerged signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fe@@ ver , without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines , including abili@@ fy .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used in patients with cr@@ amp@@ ly cases in an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or in states that are related with caution .

a weight gain is generally seen in schi@@ zop@@ hren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ic , the use of anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol to the Central nervous system , caution is advis@@ able when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with cont@@ en@@ ched side effects such as se@@ duction . ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H@@ 2 @-@ Ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a Mag@@ ens@@ äure @-@ blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , however this effect does not be relevant as clin@@ ically .

it is expected that other high effective inhibit@@ ors from CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ oxet@@ ine and par@@ oxet@@ ine , similar effects have and therefore should be made similar dosage reduction .
at CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) met@@ abolic disorder , the joint application with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol result in comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive Met@@ abol@@ is@@ ers .
if you consider the common hub of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other high @-@ effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors to abili@@ fy the potential benefits should be the potential risks to patients .
other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV @-@ Prot@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose reduction .
after distribut@@ ing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors should be the dosage of abili@@ fy on the dose height before beginning to commen@@ ce therapy .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 along with abili@@ fy can be administ@@ ered with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentr@@ ations .
in clinical trials the doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol per day no significant effect on the met@@ abolic disorders of the sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ext@@ ro@@ meth@@ or@@ an / 3 @-@ methodology ) , 2C@@ 9 ( Om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ol ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ext@@ ro@@ meth@@ morph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify her doctor if they are pregnant or a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
due to the insufficient data base for the safety when humans and due to the difficulties inherent in the animal studies , this medicine should not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits are clearly the potential risk to the fo@@ etus .
however , however in other anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines , patients should be warned of dangerous machines , including power vehicles , to use until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol have no negative influence on them .
the following side effects occurred more frequent ( Eph@@ esi@@ ans 1 / 100 ) than under plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ effects ( * ) :
the incidence of the listed side effects is defined following the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia - In a controlled long @-@ term study for 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ ic@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ie , D@@ yst@@ onie and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ etic compared to patients who were treated with sem@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 57,@@ 3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled term study for 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14,@@ 8 % was treated with patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under the age of O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar disorder - In a controlled trial for 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 53,@@ 3 % for patients under sem@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study for 12 weeks the incidence of EPS was 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under li@@ thium @-@ treatment .
during the long time planning phase over 26 weeks during a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated plac@@ ebo patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters , revealed no medic@@ ally significant differences .
boo@@ ster of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ ine @-@ phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol to patients compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo untreated patients .
among the side effects which may occur in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ al syndrome , sp@@ ic@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and scr@@ ap@@ pr@@ ism , unwanted events and increased mort@@ ality with older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch were un@@ int@@ enti@@ onal or ab@@ duc@@ ted out@@ do@@ si@@ ations with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death succ@@ ession .
although there is no information on the effectiveness of a her@@ aly@@ sis in treating an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ ol . however , it is unlikely that hem@@ or@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefits , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has a high pl@@ asma operation .
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol with schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and Ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors will be convey@@ ed .

in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage for 3 weeks with patient with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed an over plac@@ ebo @-@ superior effectiveness in reducing symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed doses of the bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to plac@@ ebo no superior effectiveness .
in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed background , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed an over plac@@ ebo @-@ superior effectiveness in week 3 and a durable effect that was comparable to that of li@@ thium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol also reported a comparable share of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ie on such as li@@ thium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .

Abra@@ x@@ ane has been studied in a main study to participate in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which around three quarters had previously been an Anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in all@@ some gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with that of a conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medication ( given in combination with other drugs to reduce side effects ) .
overall , speaking in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane untreated patients to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines .
considering the patients who have been treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between medicines and survival in terms of efficacy of disease and survival .
on the contrary , patients showed themselves in patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer in terms of these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicine .
it should also not be used in patients , the breast@@ feeding or the beginning of the treatment low ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ anthrop@@ y in the blood .
the committee for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was contained in patients with which the first treatment no longer strikes , more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el prescribed medicines must not be given with other medicines to reduce unwanted effects .
January 2008 , the European Commission granted the A@@ xis Bios@@ cience Limited approval for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .

Pac@@ at@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ lever ingredient which promotes the consolidation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the Tub@@ ular indi@@ ans and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by in@@ hibition of their deport@@ ation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to a in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network that is essential for the vital interest @-@ phase and the otic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ into the Trans@@ zy@@ t@@ ose of Plas@@ ma@@ Compon@@ ents con@@ veys on the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ical components and in the context of in @-@ vit@@ ro studies has been proven that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in is promoted by the finish of the p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ m cells .
it is thought that this improved trans@@ end@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ ale transportation is convey@@ ed by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ album recept@@ or and due to the alb@@ umin@@ bin@@ ds Prot@@ eins ( indi@@ ted aller@@ aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the field of tum@@ ors .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic Mam@@ ma@@ kar@@ zin@@ om is supported by 106 patients in two mon@@ ar@@ mi@@ ed un@@ related studies and by 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ised phase III compar@@ ative study .
in a study 43 patients treated with metastatic Mam@@ ma@@ kar@@ zin@@ om with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an inf@@ usion for 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 as an inf@@ usion has been used for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic Mam@@ ma@@ kar@@ zin@@ om .
this multi@@ centric study conducted in patients with metastatic Mam@@ ma@@ kar@@ zin@@ om , which received every 3 weeks a mon@@ otherapy with Pac@@ at@@ ax@@ el , either in the form of sol@@ vent @-@ food inf@@ usion with the prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion ( N = 229 ) .
when shooting in the study 64 % of the patients had an imp@@ aired integrity ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al met@@ ast@@ ics and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ ral pers .
14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy ; 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of met@@ ast@@ ing and 19 % due to Met@@ ast@@ asi@@ fication and the adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .

the medium @-@ part volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching ex@@ travag@@ ance distribution and / or past@@ ure connection of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study involving patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ological characteristics of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared with intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute infection from 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane compared with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 .
the clearing of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) than after a sol@@ vent @-@ based p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher in Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ab@@ ol@@ amed a biological medicine is similar , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference fail@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood sugar levels where in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur if before the procedure is not possible , and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ ol@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and patients who want to make their own ble@@ eding , Ab@@ ol@@ amed is in@@ coming into a v@@ ein .
injection can also be performed by the patient or his supervis@@ or , provided that they have received appropriate instructions .
in patients with chronic kidney failure , respectively in patients who receive chemotherapy , the hem@@ p @-@ values should always lie in recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per month in adults or between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are prior to treatment , to ensure that no iron gel consists , and iron @-@ supplements should be administ@@ ered during the entire treatment .
in patients who receive chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney disease may be a an@@ emia caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ man@@ gel or thereby that the body does not speak sufficient to the physical ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in is also used primarily operations to increase the number of red blood cells , thus reducing the consequences of a blood pressure .
it is produced by a cell that was introduced to a gene ( DNA ) that is considered to form eras in al@@ fa .
Ab@@ ol@@ amed was compared with administration as an injection in a v@@ ein in the frame of a main study with 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , compared with the terms of pharmac@@ euticals .
all patients participating in this study has had at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ein inj@@ ected before they were either turned to Ab@@ ol@@ amed or continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the change in hem@@ p @-@ values between the start of the study and the trial period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also laid the results of a study before , in which the effects of under the skin have been studied under the skin of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients suffering caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ p @-@ levels of patients were killed on se@@ perate , in the same degree as with those patients who continues to have E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
compared to this , patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , a rise in 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise of blood pressure , who occasionally cause symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opath@@ y ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ ech@@ ing mig@@ raine head@@ aches and turbul@@ ence can lead .
Ab@@ ol@@ amed must not be used in patients who may be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against ep@@ ox@@ in al@@ fa or any of the other components .
Ab@@ a@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney disease , as further studies are required to ensure that there is no allergic reactions .
the committee for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) att@@ ained to the conclusion that for Ab@@ ol@@ amed in compliance with the provisions of the European Union of evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .

the decision for use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on an benefits risk involving each patient &apos;s participation , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .

in addition , cannot be excluded that in treatment with ep@@ ox@@ in al@@ fa for patients with a starting @-@ mo@@ p @-@ value of &gt; 13 g / dl a hei@@ gh@@ tened risk to post@@ operative anal / vas@@ cular events can exist .
in several controlled studies the ep@@ et@@ ine was not proven that they can improve overall survival in tum@@ patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic aber@@ ration , or decrease the risk of tum@@ orig@@ ines .

A@@ cl@@ asta is used to treat the following illnesses : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( an illness that makes the bones spray ) both in women after men@@ opause and in men .
it is applied in patients with a high freight risk ( bon@@ qu@@ arri@@ es ) , including in patients who have recently suffered a minor gir@@ der as during the fall ; • Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et des Kno@@ chens , a disease , which changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients should take with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip actions should be obtained before the first inf@@ usion a great dose vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 W ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of Par@@ ac@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) just after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta can reduce the symptoms , such as fe@@ ver , muscle aches , gri@@ p@@ pe@@ similar symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
to treat the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
because the substance in A@@ cl@@ asta is same as in Zom@@ eta , became a part of the data material for Zom@@ eta to evaluate A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and it was investigated the number of flu@@ ids and hip re@@ frac@@ tures during a period of three years .
the second study embr@@ aces 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which had recently suffered a gir@@ dle ; it was investigated the number of frac@@ tures for a period of up to five years .
with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et A@@ cl@@ asta tested in two studies on a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with cr@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( a different Bis@@ phosph@@ onate ) .
main indicator of the efficacy was whether the content of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ ase in ser@@ um ( an enzy@@ me that builds bone sub@@ stan@@ z ) in the blood again normal or by at least 75 % compared to the output value .
in the study with older women , the risk of sp@@ oil in patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) over a period of three years compared to the patient under plac@@ ebo by 70 % .
in comparison of all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) with those under plac@@ ebo the risk of hip re@@ frac@@ tures has been reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ asta a fre@@ t ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ asta occur within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less common in repet@@ itive inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ asta may not be used in patients who may be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ym or other Bis@@ phosph@@ ate or any of the other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ ates , patients are subject to patients with A@@ cl@@ asta the risk of kidney , reactions at the inf@@ usion point and oste@@ opath@@ y ( Ab@@ dying from bone tissue ) in the ja@@ ws .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ asta provide a clearing material for doctors who use A@@ cl@@ asta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis which contains evidence as to use the medicine , as well as similar material for patients in which the effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .

after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et with A@@ cl@@ asta has been observed a long re@@ em@@ ission period in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able in patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et a sufficient intake of calcium , corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg elementary calcium , to ensure at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ ma hip , a initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis is recommended from 5@@ 0.000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D in front of the first A@@ cl@@ asta Inf@@ usion .
the incidence of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced by gift of Par@@ ac@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying A@@ cl@@ asta .
patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger .
children and young people A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended for use in children and adolesc@@ ents under 18 years , as data are missing and effectiveness are missing .
A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended for patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , as for those patient population , there are limited clinical experience .
a pre @-@ existing hyp@@ ok@@ al@@ z@@ emia is before the beginning of therapy with A@@ cl@@ asta caused by sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
because of the rapid introduction of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic on the bone structure can develop a temporary , occasionally symp@@ tom@@ atic hyp@@ ok@@ al@@ z@@ emia ; their maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advis@@ able in patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et a sufficient intake of calcium , corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg elementary calcium , to ensure at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.2 ) .

for patients who need reproductive gri@@ ps , no data are available whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ ates are reduced the risk of oste@@ opath@@ y in the ja@@ w range .
clinical evaluation by the doctor doctor should be the basis of the treatment plan of each patient and are based on an individual benefits risk assessment .
the incidence of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced by gift of Par@@ ac@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of a serious side @-@ effect reported by Vor@@ hoff@@ li@@ mmern was in patients who received A@@ cl@@ asta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received plac@@ ebo ( 0,6 % ) ( 22 by 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .

kidney clean@@ se Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic has been associated with kidney functioning ( i.e. , an increase in the ren@@ um function ( i.e. , an increase in the ren@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) and in rare cases as the kidney failure .
the change in Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ( annually before administration ) and the appearance of kidney function , as well as a limited kidney function , were comparable in a clinical study at oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine within 10 days of gift was observed at 1.8 percent of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta patients compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo untreated patients .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the trans@@ itory as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic cal@@ zi@@ um values , which are below the normal fluctu@@ ating range ( less than 2,10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , in 2.3 % of the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in a large clinical study treated patients compared to 21 % of the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pag@@ et studies .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a hip er@@ ect and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pag@@ et studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recent hip , vitamin D mirror have not been rout@@ in@@ ely tested , but the majority of patients received an initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis vitamin D prior to administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid in a large clinical study was reported via local reactions to the inf@@ usion point , such as red@@ ness , sw@@ elling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the ja@@ w space has been treated especially with cancer victims , via Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primary in the ja@@ w area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including Oste@@ om@@ yel@@ itis , and the majority of the reports refers to cancer victims according to tooth extraction or other dental migration .
7 study with 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients joined oste@@ opath@@ y in the ja@@ w line with an A@@ cl@@ asta and one with plac@@ ebo untreated patients .
in the event of a over@@ dose which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hyp@@ ok@@ al@@ z@@ emia , can be achieved through property of oral calcium and / or any intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of calcium glu@@ con@@ at .
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The effectiveness and safety of A@@ cl@@ asta 5 mg once per year for the case of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 women between the age of 65 and 89 ) with either a bone @-@ heavy @-@ sized flu@@ idi@@ fier or a BM@@ D @-@ T @-@ Score for the cau@@ li@@ fier of ≤ -@@ 2,5 with or without signs of an existing flu@@ idi@@ dy@@ gun .
effects on morph@@ omet@@ ric typ@@ icity A@@ cl@@ asta lowers a significant over a period of three years and already according to one year the incidence of one or more new sp@@ aci@@ dic functions ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ asta especi@@ al patient from 75 years and older had compared with 60 % decreased risk for flu@@ idi@@ re@@ frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip re@@ frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta proved to be a steady effect over three years that resulted in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced the risk to hip re@@ frac@@ tures .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ asta increased the bone density on len@@ tic@@ ic acid , hip , and on dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo @-@ treatment significant at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 increase of bone density of lum@@ bar vert@@ eb@@ ine by 6,@@ 7 % , the total hi@@ ps around 6,@@ 0 % , the total amount by 5.2 % , and the dist@@ al radius at 3.2 % .

summary of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public This document is a summary of the European Public survey report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the Committee for Human@@ therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) conducted studies to get recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type @-@ 2 diabetes ( also known as not ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied solely ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight individuals ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ k@@ ament ) is not displayed . • It can be applied together with another Di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ k@@ ament ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
it can additionally be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( in particular superior patients ) which cannot be satisfac@@ tor@@ ily adjusted in the highest toler@@ ated dose .
in combination with a sul@@ ph@@ yl ep@@ oxide or ins@@ ulin , the previous dosage can be maintained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( lower blood sugar ) ; here the dosage should be reduced to the sul@@ ph@@ yl of the ins@@ ulin or ins@@ ulin .
this means that the body &apos;s own ins@@ ulin can be improved considerably , and the blood sugar level decre@@ ases , which allows type @-@ 2 diabetes .
in more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of accounts in tri@@ ple@@ y were examined ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ ph@@ yl fuel , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ ded Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured that indicates how well the blood sugar has been adjusted .
Ac@@ tos led to lo@@ wering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ value , which allows the blood sugar levels in applying the doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ y study the effect of the additional gift from Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ ph@@ yl values by 0,94 % while the additional gift of plac@@ ebo led to a reduction of 0.35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of accounts and ins@@ ulin has been examined in 28@@ 9 patients reported a reduction of the h@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0,69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients suffering from additional plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects related to Ac@@ tos were visual dys@@ functions , infections of the upper respir@@ atory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hy@@ po@@ ana@@ esth@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) towards Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or one of the other components , even in patients with liver issues , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ et@@ etic ket@@ o@@ azi@@ sis ( high ket@@ ones - mamm@@ als ) in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos is to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
October 2000 un@@ divided the European Commission to Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited approval for the transport of accounts in the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to white , round , dom@@ ed and carry on one side the mark@@ ings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AC@@ TOS &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is insufficient with ins@@ ulin or in@@ compatibility with ins@@ ulin types or intoler@@ ance . ( see section 4.4 ) .
for use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on for patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients affected by the presence at least one risk factor ( i.e. former coron@@ ary heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the doctor should begin the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , weight gain or oils , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , gaining weight and oils , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is applied in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a Car@@ di@@ ovascular out@@ come study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing progressive pharmac@@ eu@@ tic disorder has been carried out .
this study showed an increase in reports of con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , which however did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study .
in patients with an increased intake of liver enz@@ ym@@ phen@@ ym@@ es ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the standard area ) or with other signs of liver disease may not be used Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
if the AL@@ T @-@ mirror increases up to 3 times of the upper limit of the standard area , the liver enz@@ ym@@ ers are to control as soon as possible .

in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has been proven a dos@@ is@@ dependent weight gain , which can be fro@@ sted by fatty deposits , and in some cases associated with a fluid treatment .
as a result of a her@@ es@@ lution , under the therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a dimin@@ ished reduction of the middle hem@@ p @-@ values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4,@@ 1 % ) .

patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is de@@ duc@@ ted ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on the investigation of the interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on does not have relevant effects on the phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or phar@@ mak@@ od@@ ynam@@ ics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .

the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ chro@@ me P@@ 450 2@@ C8@@ - In@@ hibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on around the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chro@@ me P@@ 450 2@@ C8 @-@ Indu@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in AU@@ C by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that in treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on the hyper@@ ins@@ ulin is reduced in pregnancy and increased ins@@ ulin resistance , thus reducing the availability of the met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the federal growth .

while taking the reported maximum of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific key recept@@ ors ( per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator Activ@@ ated Rec@@ ep@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) , which leads to an increased ins@@ ulin @-@ sensitivity of liver , obesity and sk@@ elet@@ on muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces the gl@@ uc@@ ose production in the liver and increases the periph@@ eral gl@@ uc@@ ose rating in the case of ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical trial with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cla@@ zi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time up to rep@@ ay@@ ment of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c by 8.0 % after the first 6 treatments ) .
at the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,@@ 0 % ) by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on at 69 % of the patients to be treated ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cla@@ w ) .
in a plac@@ eb@@ ok@@ ee study for 12 months , patients whose blood sugar has been random@@ ised in insufficient optim@@ isation phase with ins@@ ulin , to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo .
in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced the middle H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value of 0,45 % , compared to the patients who continues to receive only ins@@ ulin ; a reduction in ins@@ ulin delivery in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on .
in clinical trials over a year , under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on showed a stati@@ stically significant reduction in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ ot@@ ien@@ ten compared to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , limited to 18 weeks of examination by type @-@ 2 di@@ ab@@ etics .
in most clinical trials , compared to plac@@ ebo a reduction of the total pl@@ asma tri@@ gly@@ z@@ eride and the free fatty acids and a rise of HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as minor , however clin@@ ically no significant increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels observed .

Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane led to a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ Spi@@ der , which pointed out that the blood sugar levels were similar to a different human ins@@ ulin .
Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) to human@@ ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an may need to be adapted if it is administ@@ ered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the complete list is the pack of pack ) .
the committee for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) att@@ ained to the conclusion that the advantages of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes compared to the risks of diabetes .
October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval for the transport of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane across the European Union .
mixed ins@@ ulin products are usually used once or twice daily when a quick initial effect is desired with a longer continuing effect .
the inj@@ ecting na@@ del must be loaded at least 6 seconds under the skin to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar is significantly improved , for example , by a increased ins@@ ulin therapy , the hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia symptoms can be altered and should be advised accordingly .

if the transition to Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane is required in the patient a dosage adjustment is necessary , it may be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after switching .
some patients in which hy@@ po@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions after a shift from animal for human ins@@ ulin occurred , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia was less pronounced or unlike in their previous ins@@ ulin .
prior to travel , which should go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to obtain the Council of his physician since such trips can lead to that ins@@ ulin and meals must be applied at other times or must be taken .

A@@ den@@ uri@@ c will be used in patients having already signs of cryst@@ all@@ abl@@ ation , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or gases ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. greater urine cryst@@ all@@ ine that can lead to money and bone damage ) .
if the Har@@ ns@@ resp@@ ar &apos;s resp@@ ite after two to four weeks still lies over 6 mg per dec@@ ay , the dose can be increased to once a day 120 mg .
during the first treatment months , even rou@@ ts can still occur ; therefore , patients will remain at least during the first six months in treatment with A@@ den@@ uri@@ c or further medicines for prevention of g@@ ild@@ ly waste .
the drug is not recommended in children and in patients who had transplan@@ t a transplan@@ t as it has not been studied for these groups .
in the first study , at the 1 0@@ 72 patients attended , the efficacy thir@@ teen of different A@@ den@@ uri@@ c dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) compared with the plac@@ ebo ( spot@@ light ) and by Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( a different drug for the treatment of hyper@@ uri@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of A@@ den@@ uri@@ c ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems were only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients whose in@@ vin@@ dic@@ ation was found in the blood of the last three measurements below 6 mg / dl .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who captured A@@ den@@ uri@@ c in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who took over 120 mg in the last three measurements of the blood of under 6 mg / dl .
compared to this , this was under 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects of A@@ den@@ uri@@ c ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , arr@@ ho@@ ea ( nau@@ sea ) , rash and normal living values .
in particular with patients suffering from cardi@@ ac disease in pre @-@ history there is also an increased risk of certain side effects which concern the heart and blood vessels .
the committee for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) landed at the conclusion that A@@ den@@ uri@@ c was more effective in blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ uri@@ emia diseases , which have already led to urine test ( including one from the medical history known or currently present d@@ ich@@ t@@ ular and / or a g@@ ich@@ tar@@ th@@ ritis ) .
if the ser@@ um limb@@ s after 2 @-@ 4 weeks still amounts to 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , can be considered a dose increase on AD@@ EN@@ URI@@ C 120 mg 1 x every day .
in patients with severe kidney dys@@ functions , the effectiveness and safety have so far been studied completely ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ at Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and young people do not have experience in children and adolesc@@ ents , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group .
organ@@ graf@@ tat@@ ei@@ vers As there are no experiences in transplan@@ ts , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease in patients with isch@@ e@@ tical heart disease or de@@ co@@ ction con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure is not recommended with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( see section 4.8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ oses medicinal drugs , it can occur during the treatment program to an acute gri@@ ev@@ ing case , because by lo@@ wering the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ ns@@ u@@ eg@@ els first to be mobili@@ zed in the tissues of the tissues .

Leb@@ ail@@ ments Dur@@ ing the clinical trials of phase 3 have been observed light fl@@ yers of the liver @-@ function in using Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at actually observed ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended , prior to commen@@ cement the Feb@@ ux@@ East treatment and in the further course depending on the clin@@ ician report , perform a liver function ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ lin Z@@ war were not conducted an inter@@ acting case studies on Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ lin@@ valley ( a shirt for the Met@@ abol@@ isation of The@@ ophy@@ l@@ lin was also reported for other X@@ O @-@ Hem@@ mer ) .

7 Open @-@ time extension studies In the open long @-@ term extensions studies have been treated 9@@ 06 patients up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 3 years , 57 patients up to 4 years with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events reported during the long @-@ term and renew@@ ing studies were similar to those who were reported in the studies of the phase 3 ( see table 1 ) .
the following conf@@ isc@@ ation related events were reported in all Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ - treatment groups over once and occurred in patients who received Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ time extensions ( up to 4 years with a exposure period of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patients ) estimates according to occasionally .
the following conf@@ isc@@ ated events were reported in the P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al@@ studies of Phase 3 for these doses , either at all or with a reduced incidence :

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ URI@@ C was shown in two P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al@@ studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and fact study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1,8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ uri@@ emia and pl@@ aster .
the primary efficacy point was in every study the proportion of patients , in which the last three months of certain serv@@ ile ex@@ position &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were .
plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ URI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) , AD@@ EN@@ URI@@ C 100 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) , AD@@ EN@@ URI@@ C 100 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ sensitive to study program of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed the stati@@ stically significant superi@@ ority in terms of reduction of ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ applic@@ ants under 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) ( see table 2 and figure 1 ) 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the fact sheet was shown in terms of permanent reduction of ser@@ um development acid under 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) the stati@@ stically significant superi@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ URI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the usual used dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the lo@@ wering of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ ns@@ u@@ eg@@ els on &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the medical visit in week 2 and permanently maintained over the entire treatment .
5@@ 09 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end @-@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney @-@ functioning The AP@@ EX study examined the effectiveness at 40 patients with kidney @-@ functional cycles .
with AD@@ EN@@ URI@@ C the primary efficacy point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients achieved .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to the percentage of serv@@ o @-@ compliant with proxy , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) .
primary end @-@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ oc@@ entri@@ c con@@ form@@ ations Fig . 10 mg / dl About 40 % of the patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and fact @-@ study ) had combined to study ( bas@@ eline ) a ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ centr@@ ation of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years collected data from the open extensions study of phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of the incidence of gases needed to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) declined in the incidence of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 a treatment against a ch@@ ich@@ ch@@ ub ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment against a ch@@ ast@@ ch@@ ub ) .
this was associated with a reduction in sleeve size , which resulted in 54 % of the patients a complete dis@@ appearance of G@@ ich@@ t@@ k@@ otes up to 24 months .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.@@ 0 % ) and also patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5,@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extensions studies ( see section 4.4 ) .

for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg in AU@@ C , a rise in AU@@ C is observed , the greater than the dos@@ is@@ propor@@ tion@@ ate increase .
after taking easy or multi @-@ piece cans of 80 and 120 mg 1 x every day the C@@ max amounts approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.6 µ@@ g / ml .
however , not a clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage of ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ oc@@ entri@@ c acid observed , provided that this has been tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .

the pl@@ aster rot@@ ary use of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9,@@ 2 % ( primary relation to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is controlled via the concentration width , which is achieved with doses from 80 and 120 mg .
in vit@@ ro studies on human liver melan@@ omas showed that these oxid@@ ative met@@ abolic divisions mainly made through CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ C8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 are formed and that Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ glu@@ cur@@ oni@@ d primarily arises from U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after consuming a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C mark@@ ed Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , about 49 % of the dose in urine as un@@ altered Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ ing oni@@ d of the ingredient ( 30 % ) , whose conf@@ oxid@@ ative met@@ abolic disorders and their con@@ ju@@ gate supply ( 3 % ) again .
apart from the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the urine also found about 45 % of the dose in the chair as un@@ changing Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ ing oni@@ d of the ingredient ( 1 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative met@@ abolic and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 7 % ) as well as other unknown Met@@ abol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .

age There were no significant changes in terms of AU@@ C from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or its met@@ abolic path@@ ogen@@ ic doses of AD@@ EN@@ URI@@ C in older patients compared to younger pro@@ ban@@ den observed .
car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ ese , imp@@ air@@ ment of the Fer@@ ti@@ lit@@ ter In male rats has been found a stati@@ stically significant increase of ur@@ inary medicines ( trans@@ itional pap@@ ill@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ ome ) only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin @-@ stones in the up@@ do@@ zed group , found in some of the 11 @-@ times of exposure to humans .
these findings are seen as a result of specialized inter@@ met@@ abolic and urine isation and for clinical use as not relevant .
it has been noted that Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the skill and reproduction performance of male and female rats .

AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are cre@@ aky ) in women following men@@ opause , where a risk for a small vitamin D mirror consists .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking , or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and vit@@ amin@@ ad@@ dic@@ tive ) .
in order to avoid a irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may take place until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 are already applied separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the Company presented data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to detect the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE in relation to increasing the vitamin D mirror .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients with lower vitamin D @-@ mirror with the patients were treated with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE , less ( 11 % ) than those who were exclusively Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) .
the company also put data in front of the fact that the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose is exactly the dose which is required for the prevention of a bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of mus@@ cul@@ pt@@ ors ( digest@@ ive disorders ) , const@@ ip@@ ation , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , cre@@ ases ( ul@@ c@@ era ) , cre@@ ases ( ul@@ c@@ era ) , cre@@ vices ( ul@@ c@@ era ) , sp@@ ri@@ fied Ab@@ dom@@ es ( g@@ wing stomach ) as well as aci@@ res .
for patients with any hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity ( all@@ ergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D@@ 3 or one of the other components may not be used AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE .
it may not be applied in diseases of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand up or sit at least 30 minutes .
Janu@@ ary@@ 2007 the European Commission divided the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . a permit for the transport of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE across the European Union .
capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side .
AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is just with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , beverage or inser@@ tion of medicines ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and vit@@ amin@@ ad@@ dic@@ ates ) for the day .
following notes are accurate to follow in order to reduce the risk of ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation and related effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE should be lu@@ red after the day of the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a exists . • The patients should not take place before the first food intake of the day , which shall take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. p@@ tical Ul@@ kus , active gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal ble@@ eding or surgical procedures in the upper part of gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal tra@@ kt except p@@ yl@@ or@@ oplast@@ y , can be given only in particular caution ( see section 4.3 ) .
o@@ int@@ oph@@ age@@ al reactions , such as o@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a and ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al ero@@ gene@@ ous , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partly , these sever@@ ely severe and called a hospital transfer ) .
the doctor should therefore take attention to all indications and symptoms that are pointed out to possible mal@@ oph@@ age@@ ical reactions , and patients should be pointed out , using symptoms such as dy@@ lit@@ ag@@ ie , pain when pressing or retrospec@@ tive pain , or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn or so@@ ften the medicine to fetch and medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of severe offensive @-@ effects seems to be increased in patients that does not take the medicine properly and / or it follows the occurrence of symptoms that point to a mal@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that all d@@ osing sessions will be passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while in large parts of clinical trial with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk was found , rare ( after market launch ) Mag@@ - und Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe severe and with complications , reports ( see section 4.8 ) .
oste@@ opath@@ y of the ja@@ w , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ yel@@ itis ) , was reported in cancer victims , whose therapeutic period was predomin@@ ously reported by intraven@@ ous Bis@@ phosph@@ ata .
there are no data available to indicate whether the ab@@ using a bis@@ phosph@@ onate therapy in patients who need a ki@@ i@@ ent surgical procedure , reduces the risk of oste@@ opath@@ y of the ki@@ ef@@ ers .
clinical evaluation by the physician doctor is decisive for therap@@ ists in each patient based on an individual benefits risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted that they are supposed to take during the meeting of a dose AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE the tablet in the next morning after having noticed their failure .
they are supposed to take no two tablets on the same day , but taking the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned for the week@@ day .
other diseases which affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) , should be addressed at the beginning of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE as well .
al@@ end@@ ron@@ at foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium @-@ supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can affect the absorption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at when they are taken at the same time .
therefore , patients must wait after the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific inter@@ activity studies were not conducted , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at has been taken jointly with a variety of usually prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is only provided for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable to women during pregnancy .
animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at have no indication of directly ash@@ amed effects in terms of pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ opath@@ y of the ja@@ w was reported in patients under Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ aten ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but has also been reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis .

during the two @-@ year pro@@ long@@ ation of these studies the arri@@ vals of the BM@@ D of the sp@@ ine and con@@ k@@ han@@ ter continues to maintain ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ tos@@ sing and the entire body has been maintained .
fit consisted of two plac@@ eb@@ ot@@ or controlled trials , where Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily continue to be taken over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study the daily amount of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at reduced by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .

in oste@@ opor@@ osis , al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was effective when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drinking of the day .
in healthy subjects , the property led by oral Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ on ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) to no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( increase in the area of 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies on rats has sur@@ rendered that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at has been distributed according to intraven@@ ous form of 1 mg / kg temporarily in past@@ ures , but then quickly converted into the bones or out with the urine .

Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is administ@@ ered adult patients whose kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent a rep@@ ul@@ sion of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the Company presented the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from the published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney disease , whereby the application of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ ts was rep@@ lic@@ ated after a treatment duration of a year ( by trying , for example , a renewed transplan@@ t or a res@@ ump@@ tion of the di@@ aly@@ sis needed ) .
moreover , more recent studies have been conducted on 119 patients with kidney disease and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t and studied how Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft from the body .

due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of system@@ ic exposure to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m , this can lead to transplan@@ ts or to an increased incidence of side @-@ effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression .
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; the formulation of the formulation or the regime should only be made under the eng@@ aging control of one in the transplan@@ t medical physician ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
in a result of a switch to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug surveillance and appropriate dose custom@@ iz@@ ations must be carried out to ensure that the system@@ ic ex@@ position of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m remains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and compatibility in individual cases and blood levels &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see below &quot; &quot; &quot;
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m talents should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after switching .
on day 4 was the system@@ ic exposure , measured as a talent , with both form@@ ulations both at kidney and well transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repet@@ itive controls of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m talents are recommended during the first two weeks of transplan@@ t under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f to ensure proper substance exposure to the immediate follow @-@ off phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m a substance with low Clear@@ ance is , a adaptation of the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f @-@ Dos@@ is@@ chem@@ as can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State can be reached .
if the condition of the patient in the first post@@ operative phase does not allow oral intake of intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentration at the production of an inf@@ usion solution ) , with a dose of ca .
the duration of the application z@@ ur repression of Tran@@ splan@@ t rep@@ ul@@ sion must maintain the immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression ; consequently , a maximum duration of the oral therapy cannot be given .
dose Rec@@ ommen@@ dation - Nier@@ transplan@@ t proph@@ yla@@ xis of Tran@@ splan@@ t Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f @-@ Therapie should begin with 0.20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dosage adjustment can be later required since the Phar@@ mak@@ oc@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m can change in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t proph@@ yla@@ xis of Tran@@ splan@@ t , Tran@@ splan@@ t Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f @-@ Therapie should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendations - switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f must become a transplan@@ t from twice daily dosage from Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules upon a once daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , so this shift in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , compared to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ t after a shift from other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f once daily needs to commen@@ ce the treatment with the treatment in kidney and liver transplan@@ t for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of Tran@@ splan@@ tation Action exp@@ ul@@ sion .
heart transplan@@ t For adult patients who are posed to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is an oral initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis of 0,15 mg / kg / day each morning .
other Tran@@ splan@@ ts , although there are no clinical experience with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f in pneum@@ atic , pan@@ cre@@ atic and cru@@ el transplan@@ ted patients in a oral initi@@ ator of 0.2 mg / kg / day , during pan@@ cre@@ atively dispos@@ als of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in gut transplan@@ ts in a oral pu@@ al@@ do@@ sis of 0,3 mg / kg / day to application .
dosage adjustment in special patients groups patients with reduced Leb@@ ail@@ function ten@@ ur maintenance of blood cells in the requested area may be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions a her@@ it@@ isation of the dose required .
patients with reduced kidney function As the kidney function does not influence the pharmaceutical in@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m , it can be understood that a dosage adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ical potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m , however , a careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ ine levels , is recommended for monitoring the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ clear@@ ance and monitoring of the ur@@ inary tract ) .
switching from Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f in the shift from a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m @-@ based therapy is caution ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations concerning the drug mirror in full blu@@ t , the dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and compatibility in individual cases under the capture of full @-@ tone tac@@ tic thr@@ ust controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m talents during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by peri@@ o@@ dical checks while generating therapy .
blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m should also be controlled by Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , Dos@@ is@@ custom@@ isation , modifications of immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in simultaneous application of substances , which could change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m of thorou@@ gh@@ ness @-@ concentration . ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is a drug with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments to the dose require several days until the Ste@@ ady State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the mir@@ rors within the blood 20 ng / ml can not exceed .
in clinical practice the talents of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m in the full blo@@ ated in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts usually lies in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and se@@ ased - and hearty patients with 10 - 20 ng / ml .
while the stri@@ ving therapy of liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac transplan@@ ts were generally used to use blood concentration in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml .
this has led to serious undes@@ irable events , including transplan@@ ts or other side effects which can occur in a row of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m sub@@ - or ex@@ position .
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; the formulation of the formulation or the regime should only be made under the eng@@ aging control of one in the transplan@@ t medical physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 The treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ t rep@@ ul@@ sion , which proved to be ref@@ ill over other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants , are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
at the proph@@ yla@@ xis of Tran@@ splan@@ t @-@ rep@@ ul@@ sion with adult heart transplan@@ ts and transplan@@ ts in the movies are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
because of possible interactions , which can lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ Muslim levels in the blood and a ton@@ ing of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m , the intake of herbal supplements ( hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) contain , or other plant @-@ fr@@ ad@@ ine as a treatment with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful surveillance of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - concentr@@ ations provided in the blood since the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m blood levels can be subjected to considerable fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f one was referred to as Kar@@ di@@ omy@@ opath@@ y and observed hyper@@ trop@@ hia , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
further factors that increase the risk of such clin@@ ically disorders are an already existing heart suffering , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ ous anxiety , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , fluid @-@ load and oils .
as with other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ si@@ va , the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted for the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin change by suitable clothing or using a paras@@ itic factor .
if patients who occupy Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , Symp@@ toms for PR@@ ES such as head@@ aches , altered consciousness of consciousness , cr@@ amps and t@@ end@@ ons should show a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.@@ g .

the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies which are known as inhibit@@ or or in@@ duc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m and thus increase the blood@@ stream of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m .
it therefore recommends to monitor the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ muscle tissue in comparison of chemical substances that can alter the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism , and to set the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m dose to maintain moderate concentr@@ ations respectively ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive fix@@ ation was carried out with an@@ tim@@ y@@ k@@ ica such as ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and Vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole , as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic S@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ector release ( z .
pharmaceutical therapy affects the increase of blood levels primarily from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m , due to the in@@ hibition of gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal metabolism .
high @-@ based pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on as it is used in acute symptoms , the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m can increase or decrease in blood .
effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ Hem@@ mer ; therefore the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m with medicines that will affect through CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , whose metabolism is com@@ promised .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contra@@ sts put up and thus increase the hormone position , is particularly careful in decisions about recep@@ tive policies .
the results of animals have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m can decrease Clear@@ ance of Pen@@ to@@ bar@@ bit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ time .
the results of a small number of investigations on transplan@@ t patients deliver no indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m compared to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants a hei@@ gh@@ tened risk of unwanted events with regard to the course and the result of pregnancy .

in three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was investigated with prevention of ble@@ eding and surgical interventions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the main study the effectiveness of advoc@@ ates was assessed by the prevention of ble@@ eding in 86 % of 510 new blood @-@ se@@ iso@@ ara with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , Py@@ rex@@ ia ( fe@@ ver ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
advoc@@ ates may not be used in patients who may be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against the human t@@ inn@@ ation factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other components .
March 2004 the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG approved the approval of Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy address the sever@@ ance of a factor of VIII , according to the place and extent of the blood and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following h@@ yst@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events the factor VIII is intended in the corresponding period not under the specified Plas@@ m@@ ace ( in % of the norm or in i.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours for patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and acute imp@@ air@@ ment are eliminated .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours for patients under 6 years ) will be repeated until the risk for the patient is over .
during the treatment course , the control of the inj@@ ections and frequency of inj@@ ections will provide an adequate identification of the factor VIII pl@@ asma seal .
individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII different in vi@@ vo Recovery and have differ@@ ing half @-@ times .

if the expected factor could not be achieved , or if the ble@@ eding control is not dominated with an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out to address a inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ory values , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic interventions need to be weigh@@ ed .
the administration @-@ speed should focus on the treatment of the patient , whereby the maximum injection @-@ rate should not be exceeded by 10 ml / min .
the formation of neutr@@ alising antibodies against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation activity of factor VIII stra@@ ined Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins which are at Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml Plas@@ ma via modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of inhibit@@ ors to develop , cor@@ related to the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby risk within the first 20 ex@@ position is on the biggest and of genetic and other factors .
in case of previously untreated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure and an@@ am@@ nest@@ ically well known intu@@ ition , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re@@ occur of ( lower ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare appearance of the hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences regarding the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast@@ feeding .
the inhibit@@ ors of the biggest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors to factor VIII ( 5 patients ) which have appeared all previously untreated patients who exhibit a higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fe@@ ver and di@@ zz@@ iness ( each 3 patients ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the data available not in@@ estim@@ able ) .

based on the data available since the first post @-@ post data , the CH@@ MP will continue to be rated as positive , but considering that the safety profile should be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , CH@@ MP is based on the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a fil@@ ing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months required , decided to apply the regulatory procedure for 5 years in 5 years .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular Limited announces the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ore ( CH@@ MP ) officially , that the company takes its application for approval for the transport of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones , or the past@@ ure ( tissues , the other structures in the body links , surrounds and base ) .
this is a kind of virus that has been gene@@ tically modified , that it may carry an gene in the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ den@@ o@@ Scan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that has been changed so that there cannot be any copies of himself and therefore cannot trigger infection with people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
advoc@@ acy could have been har@@ dened directly into the tum@@ ors and allow for cancer cells to make the normal p@@ 53 protein once more .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is produced from the broken DNA inside the human body existing p@@ 53 @-@ gene , is normally characterized by the restoration of damaged DNA and the killing of cells in when the DNA cannot be recovered .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , with which the p@@ 53 @-@ Gen def@@ ect is , the p@@ 53 @-@ protein does not work properly , and the canc@@ er@@ ous cells can continue to grow and share .
the company put data from a study with a patient in front of the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer in the area of under@@ mining , in the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP had examined the answers of the company on the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ solved .
based on the examination of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP indicates a day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
according to CH@@ MP opinion , not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ors brings benefits to patients .
the committee also had concerns about the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration , and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company had not proven sufficient that advoc@@ acy can be produced in a reliable way and that neither for the environment nor for people coming in close contact with the patient is harmful .
the CH@@ MP did not know whether the decl@@ ining consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ ata @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed substance release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets have so assembled are that one of the effective ingredients are released immediately and the other gradually released over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ op@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( pit@@ falls , caused by an all@@ ergy against pol@@ len , inflammation of the nose @-@ way ) in patients with nas@@ al gland ( pet@@ ri@@ fter nose ) .
for adults and adolesc@@ ents from 12 years the recommended dose of aer@@ y@@ ze is twice daily with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended once the symptoms , above all the sw@@ elling of the nose @-@ slo@@ ping nose ( hidden nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the drug can be dimin@@ ished to the const@@ ip@@ ation of your nose .
the main effective dimensions were the changes of the sword @-@ wheel of the h@@ yst@@ amp @-@ symptoms which were reported by the patients before the start of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study the patients carried out their symptoms all 12 hours into a di@@ ary with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms have been in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all the h@@ ay of h@@ ay symptoms , besides the const@@ ip@@ ation of the nose reported the patients suffering from the symptoms around 46,@@ 0 % , compared to 35,@@ 9 % in the patient , the P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone .
if only the sw@@ elling of the nose @-@ sl@@ um has been viewed , patients under Aer@@ ina@@ ze showed a alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms around 37,@@ 4 % compared to 26,@@ 7 % in patients who captured des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ ina@@ ze ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are Tach@@ y@@ kar@@ die ( heart@@ beat ) , oral disease , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ ot@@ ha@@ sis , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , Som@@ n@@ ol@@ enz ( keys ) , ins@@ ular disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ y@@ ze is allowed to treat patients who may be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other components , against rep@@ lic@@ ing agents or lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another medicine for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) are not applied .
Aer@@ ina@@ ze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a Eng@@ age glau@@ coma ( raised eye pressure ) , cardi@@ ac disease or vas@@ cular diseases ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sive ( hyper@@ function of the thy@@ ro@@ id ) or have had a risk of hem@@ orrho@@ ea ( caused by a brain ble@@ eding ) or have a risk for a h@@ ag@@ rh@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe approval for the transport of aer@@ on@@ ze across the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is to swal@@ low in the whole ( i.e. without sh@@ attered , break or ch@@ ew ) .
Aer@@ ina@@ ze was supposed to be applied because of the lack of data for obj@@ ection@@ able and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) not to be applied in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after ending the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the use of application for 10 days , since long @-@ term application the activity of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can take with time .
after drop the sw@@ elling of veil@@ ed in the upper respir@@ atory because the treatment could be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as mon@@ otherapy .
da Aer@@ ina@@ ze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine also contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients suffering from a mon@@ ograph ( MA@@ O ) in@@ dem@@ ic or within 2 weeks after the end of such treatment .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ im@@ im@@ tic activity in combin@@ ated application of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ crip@@ tors , Per@@ go@@ lid , ic@@ erg@@ ics , di@@ od@@ ine or other dec@@ on@@ gest@@ iv@@ a , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , Eph@@ edr@@ ine , O@@ xy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient leader and the data are not enough to address appropriate recommendations for dosage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the safety and effectiveness of aer@@ op@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver tumor , and the data are not enough to address appropriate recommendations for dosage .
patients must be informed that treatment during the occurrence of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ ometer , cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mia , nau@@ sea or any other neurological symptoms must be abol@@ ished ( like head@@ aches or any strengthening of head@@ aches ) .
in the treatment of the following patient groups , patients under Digital@@ is • patients with cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ path@@ ological market in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder , or bron@@ chi@@ as@@ cul@@ ation in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
Aer@@ ina@@ ze has declined at least 48 hours before carrying out der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators for aging actions or to reduce their extent .
in the framework of clinical tests with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administ@@ ered , however no clinical @-@ relevant interactions or changes of the pl@@ asma @-@ concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine have been observed .
in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or@@ ical tests no significant differences could be observed between the patients using des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and those associated with plac@@ ebo untreated patients regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was taken alone or with alcohol .
this has not been identified for the met@@ abolic disorders of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine enz@@ ym@@ es , so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hib@@ mt in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 does not in@@ hibit and neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the in@@ concei@@ vable of the application of aer@@ op@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experience gained from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of normal population .
since reproduction studies on animals have not always been transmitted to humans and on the basis of vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ tic properties of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine should not be applied Aer@@ ina@@ ze in pregnancy .
patients should be un@@ resolved , however , that in very rare cases it may come to a stu@@ per , which may result in a imp@@ air@@ ment of transportation or ability to use machines .
symptoms may vary between an Z@@ joint @-@ depression ( pro@@ ving , ap@@ nea , dimin@@ ished mental atten@@ de@@ es , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular col@@ ou@@ aps ) and an Z@@ NS stim@@ ulation ( ins@@ om@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , con@@ vul@@ sions , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ als .

an Z@@ NS m@@ ab@@ ide is most likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( oral drying , pu@@ pi@@ ping rigi@@ d and - di@@ lat@@ ation , grasp , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ) .
these include both the im@@ itation of the release of pro @-@ inflammat@@ ory cy@@ tok@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human m@@ ast cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es , as well as the in@@ ression of the expression of the ad@@ h@@ ä@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ek@@ ül@@ s P @-@ Sel@@ ect@@ in on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ical cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes , including the strengthening of subjective mud or the tasks that are connected with the flies .
in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily , no increased incidence of s@@ fri@@ ction compared to plac@@ ebo .
the or@@ ale application of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can generate another sympath@@ om@@ im@@ tic effects such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ die or manifest@@ ations of an Z@@ NS arousal .
it took 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis , where 4@@ 14 patients Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets received .
in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ y tablets , determined by the overall value for symp@@ tom ( except the nose @-@ pri@@ mal @-@ sw@@ elling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ y tablets with regard to the fluctu@@ ating effect , determined by the nose @-@ skin sw@@ elling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ y tablets showed no significant differences in regard to gender , age or ethnic groups .
as part of a single @-@ dose study to the Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ ina@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine is ad@@ mitt@@ able within 30 minutes after the administration of the pl@@ asma .

A@@ eri@@ us was conducted in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis and two studies in patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of p@@ add@@ les , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep and capacity in the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies were submitted to prove that the body is able to take the sy@@ rup , the solution to one and the mel@@ ting @-@ coated tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children are harmless .
associated with allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were collected , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us to an average absorption of symp@@ tom ( symp@@ tom ) around 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients who received a plac@@ ebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria was the decrease of the symp@@ tom after six @-@ weeks treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % compared with plac@@ ebo untreated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or any of the other components .

the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ edly allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should occur following the date of the disease and may termin@@ ate after the sound of the symptoms and when they re @-@ appear again .
in the persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ( appearance of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the aller@@ ie time a continual treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have been found in the context of clinical studies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were also administ@@ ered ( see below Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ phar@@ ma study conducted by A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol , the performance @-@ natural effect of alcohol is not reinforced ( see below Section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be un@@ resolved , however , that in very rare cases , may occur that an imp@@ air@@ ment of transportation or ability to use machines can be used .
clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most common side @-@ effects that has been reported more common than plac@@ ebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , oral drying ( 0,8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0,6 % ) .
in a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients from 12 to 17 years the most common side @-@ effect head@@ aches , these were treated at 5.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and treated with 6.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ subject study , in which up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine have been administ@@ ered ( nin@@ et@@ ly clinical dose ) , no clinical @-@ relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the im@@ itation of the release of pro@@ mont@@ ory cy@@ tok@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human m@@ ast cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es , as well as the in@@ ression of the expression of the ad@@ h@@ ä@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ek@@ ül@@ s P @-@ Sel@@ ect@@ in on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ium cells .
as part of a clinical study with multi @-@ specialist in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no stati@@ stically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ac effect was described .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold the clinical dose ) was administ@@ ered over ten days without a renewal of the Q@@ T@@ c inter@@ v@@ alls .
in a single dos@@ is@@ - study with adults showed des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg no influence on standard measurement sizes , including the strengthening of subjective mud or the tasks that are connected with the flies .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ but@@ ary and red@@ ness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and Per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ itis in dependence on the duration of the symptoms may also be divided into interactive rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ edly allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks .
how with the total image of the questionnaire to the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ Konjunk@@ tiv@@ itis was shown , an@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ished por@@ eri@@ us effectively die due to seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tik@@ aria was evaluated for further forms of urine , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology in the different forms is similar and chron@@ ically patients can be pursued simple pro@@ spek@@ tiv .
since the Hist@@ o@@ fre@@ aders , a cur@@ ative factor in all ancient idi@@ opath@@ ic diseases is expected , that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is besides the chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tik@@ aria even in other forms of urine , to improve the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tik@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and de@@ composition of size and number of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first tin @-@ inter@@ v@@ alls .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka , chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tik@@ aria , the minority of patients who were not re@@ acted to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka from the study .
an improvement of the itch around more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo untreated patients .
the treatment with as@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wax , as is measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to assess this variable .
in a pharmaceutical in@@ gl@@ ine@@ tics study , in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis -@@ Pop@@ ulation , was achieved at 4 % of the patients a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
there are no cl@@ ue to a clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
the enzy@@ me of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ dic@@ ated enz@@ ym@@ es was not yet identified so that interactions with other drugs are not quite excluded
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tumor growth in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 does not in@@ hibit and neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dos@@ is@@ study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 7.5 mg more meals ( fatty , low @-@ cal@@ orie breakfast ) do not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
the clinical trials carried out with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a comparable degree of exposure to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the tox@@ icity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and by Lor@@ at@@ adin .
based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ di@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repe@@ atable quality , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for reproduction , the pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine do not identify specific haz@@ ards to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of the meals , to alle@@ vi@@ ation of the symptoms associated with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ edly and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see under section 5.1 ) .
the pres@@ cri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years can be caused by an infection ( see under section 4.4 ) and that no data is available that aid a infectious rhin@@ itis with an@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respir@@ atory infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ ali@@ es should play a role in diagn@@ osing the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , physical research and appropriate laboratory and skin investigations .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years met@@ abo@@ ise des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine restricted and experienced a higher dimensions ( see under section 5.2 ) .
the security of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years , which have limited met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze , is identical to those with children that are normally met@@ abolic .
this medicine contains Sac@@ char@@ ose and Sor@@ bit@@ ol . therefore , patients should not take with her@@ ed@@ itary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , gl@@ uc@@ ose @-@ dis@@ sor@@ ption or a Sac@@ char@@ asis @-@ Is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ - in@@ suff@@ iciency of this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have been found in the context of clinical studies with an@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were also administ@@ ered ( see below Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ phar@@ ma study conducted by A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the in@@ consistent effect of alcohol is not reinforced ( see under section 5.1 ) .
the pre@@ valence of side @-@ effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group like at the plac@@ ebo group .
clinical studies with adults and young people in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ subject study conducted by adults and juven@@ iles , in which up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine have been administ@@ ered ( nin@@ et@@ ru@@ ple clinical dose ) , no clinical @-@ relevant effects were observed .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 years ago , who received an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in@@ do@@ sis of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tik@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine are similar to adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can be applied to adults on the population &apos;s population extr@@ ap@@ oli@@ ert .
as part of a clinical study with multi @-@ specialist studies on adults and young people , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine used in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days was not described as a stati@@ stically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ac effect .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolesc@@ ents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold the clinical dose ) was applied for over ten days in adults , no renewal of the Q@@ T@@ c inter@@ v@@ alls was shown .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolesc@@ ents has no increased incidence of sl@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo .
during a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were conducted by adults and juven@@ iles in clinical studies with no imp@@ air@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ ors .
in clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological studies in adults it came by the simultaneous intake of alcohol neither to a rein@@ forcement of alcohol in@@ duced power imp@@ aired , nor to increase the sl@@ iness .
in adult and adol@@ es@@ cent patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ but@@ ary and red@@ ness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
how on the basis of the questionnaire to the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ Konjunk@@ tiv@@ itis was shown , decreased A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively die due to seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tik@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and de@@ composition of size and number of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first tin @-@ inter@@ v@@ alls .
the spread of this restricted met@@ abolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than by Kau@@ k@@ asi@@ ern ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ological parameters were observed in a phar@@ yn@@ ge@@ tic multi @-@ professional study with the Sir@@ up@@ form@@ ulating with children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis , which are limited to metabol@@ ise .
the burden ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was after 3 to 6 hours higher and the C@@ max approximately 3 to 4@@ times higher with an termin@@ ale half @-@ time of about 120 hours .
there are no cl@@ ue to a clin@@ ically relevant ingredient of Kum@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and young people .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.r.l. the Committee for Human@@ therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) officially recogni@@ zes the company to withdraw its application for approval by A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to the prevention of avi@@ ge@@ H@@ 5@@ N1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ f@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly persons for the protection against flu , which is caused by strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 from the Inf@@ lu@@ enza A @-@ Virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a trunk of Greek virus that could cause a future pan@@ dem@@ ic .
a gri@@ pping v@@ ant@@ ie breaks out when a new trunk of Greek virus emerg@@ es , which can easily spread from man to man , because people still have no imm@@ unity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the vaccine contained in the vaccine as &quot; body foreign &quot; and makes antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system is able to form faster antibodies in a contact with a grip virus .
then the membrane envel@@ op of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recogni@@ zes the human body as body foreign ) , certified and used as a component of the vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not conducted in accordance with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine in order to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA region for pre @-@ pan@@ dem@@ ic vaccines .
if you are interested in a clinical trial and need further information on your treatment , please contact your physician doctor .
for more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please refer to the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines to treat adults and children over four years which are infected with human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus from type 1 ( HIV / 1 ) , which caused the acquired immun@@ isation reduction Syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase stands as a solution to deposit , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , since the security of this combination was not investigated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined what anti@@ vir@@ al medicines has been taken before , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood has judged that the virus will appeal to the drug . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is directed after the body weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aging is reduced in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al drugs called the HIV quantity in the blood and keeps them at a low level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
AIDS not to cure , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of associated infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , investig@@ ates two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV infected adults , which had previously not been dealt with the release numbers .
that with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicinal plant in A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with 206 adults , which had been taken before the release of the release , with other proteins numbers .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ proven concentr@@ ations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the amend@@ ment of the Vir@@ us@@ last after the treatment .
in the studies with patients who previously had not taken a prototype had been taken under A@@ cu@@ bic more patients a vir@@ g@@ load less than 400 copies / ml than under plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children of decreased no@@ gener@@ ase also the Vir@@ us last , however , were treated by the children who had previously been treated with the release numbers , were very few to the treatment .
in the study with adults , which had been treated earlier with the release numbers , that with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicinal product A@@ gener@@ ase the Vir@@ us@@ last after 16 @-@ weeks treatment just as effective as other proteins :
in the patients with HIV , that was against four other prot@@ ector release , it came under A@@ cu@@ bic together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the Vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks as with the patients who received their former prot@@ ector release :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( blood ) , v@@ om@@ iting , rash and F@@ ati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r or any other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients the cur@@ rant ( an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or drugs which are just as gener@@ aliz@@ ations and are in high concentr@@ ations in the blood of health harmful .
as with other drugs against HIV , patients tend to take the risk of al@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , a oste@@ onic comp@@ ression ( symptoms of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection caused by the reco@@ vering immune system ) .
the committee for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) att@@ ained to the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines to treat patients to investigate HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gen@@ ase is usually taken together with pharmac@@ pharmac@@ euticals ampli@@ fier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee proved that the use of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have not previously taken on the release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as at the time of approval for scientific reasons , only limited information is available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Group Gla@@ xo Group Limited approval for the transport of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines used for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , prot@@ ru@@ st@@ bin ( PI ) to be shown in adults and children from 4 years onwards .
for usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules for the pharmac@@ eu@@ ph@@ in@@ tic boo@@ sting of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r can be administ@@ ered together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of comp@@ atri@@ cs should take place in consideration of the individual vir@@ al resi@@ st@@ acy and the treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of pren@@ eur@@ r as a solution to inser@@ ting is by 14 % lower than the capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to inser@@ ting on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ change@@ able ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of comp@@ utation twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fier of k@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of amp@@ ant capsules / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines up to a day @-@ weight loss of 2400 mg of amp@@ ant medication which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmaceutical in@@ vari@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other proteins are not examined in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years due to the lack of data for obj@@ ection@@ able and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ ological data , the dose of an arom@@ ase capsules in adult patients should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions on 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application is to occur in patients with mild or moderate liver tumor with caution , in patients with severe liver tumor , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also present sub@@ str@@ ate of the Cy@@ to@@ chro@@ me P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal supplements containing cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) , may not be applied due to the risk of reduced Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gen@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or cont@@ amination with blood .
for usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be applied together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients who are suffering from chronic h@@ epatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al gland therapy , have an increased risk for severe liver co@@ atings with potentially fatal course .
for the event of con@@ current anti@@ vir@@ al treatment of h@@ epatitis B or C please read the relevant information in this medicine .
patients with pre@@ existing limited h@@ epatitis including a chronic @-@ active h@@ epatitis reveal a increased incidence of liver dys@@ functions using a anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al process therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ tik@@ oid , which are swit@@ ched over CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended , unless that the potential benefits of a treatment over@@ thre@@ w the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ rid@@ ast@@ ero@@ i@@ der effects including mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and supple@@ mentation of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a con@@ centric Re@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin strongly dependent of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , becomes a simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin because of the increased risk of my@@ op@@ ia , including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards Rati@@ o ) , methods for determining the drug con@@ centr@@ ation .
in patients who take these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective due to decreased Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ar by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r less effectively ( see section 4.5 ) .
because of the possibility of met@@ abolic interactions with amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r may change the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills however the information may not be sufficient to estimate the type of interactions .
when meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time using am@@ us@@ avi@@ r , patients should be monitored on o@@ pi@@ atal symptoms , especially if there is also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r administ@@ ered .
due to the potential risk of tox@@ icity , due to the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ co@@ is of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution to inser@@ tion , this In@@ rich@@ ment is contra@@ indicated with children under a age of four years and should be applied with caution at certain other patient groups .
it should be set in the duration 5 when a rash may be accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or ( see section 4.8 ) .

although a multi@@ fact@@ orial ae@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ tico @-@ ero@@ ids , alcohol intake , heavy immune supp@@ ression , higher Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ) , have been reported cases of oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rous in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al process therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ sub@@ str@@ ate with little therapeutic width of a gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with drugs which have a small therapeutic width and also provide sub@@ str@@ ate of the Cy@@ to@@ chro@@ me P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ sub@@ str@@ ate with slight therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with pharmac@@ euticals , whose activity is primarily swit@@ ched via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are connected to the increased pl@@ asma seal with fatal and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C caused by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to say that to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a resistance development .
in trying to cut the un@@ important pl@@ asma seal through a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently unwanted effects on the liver observed .
Johann@@ is@@ nel ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) The Ser@@ um@@ eration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous application of herbal extracts with cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient takes already cur@@ rant , the am@@ us@@ avi@@ r@@ mirror is and , if possible , to check the Vir@@ us@@ last and reduce the cur@@ rant .
a dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered together with am@@ us@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ews ) .
5@@ 08 % increases , low for C@@ max on the other around 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ us@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered .
in clinical trial doses were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which occupy the effectiveness and imm@@ ort@@ ality of this treatment chem@@ ist .
52 % reduced if amp@@ ant ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg L@@ opin@@ av@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administ@@ ered .
the C@@ min @-@ values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg ) ( 400 mg ) ( 400 mg ) ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily is administ@@ ered .
a d@@ osing rate for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , there is however a machine @-@ machine vision , since the effectiveness and in@@ concei@@ vable of this combination is not known .
there is no pharmac@@ ological study carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the ant@@ acid component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in recommended that revenues from Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) .
therefore , the property of E@@ f@@ avi@@ r is required in combination with Am@@ fre@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no tin @-@ adap@@ tion necessary .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ deo in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the ex@@ position of both proteins are concerned .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in on other proteins and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in may possibly sen@@ ate the ser@@ um@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of Am@@ iga .
if these medicines should be used at the same time , caution is offered because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is less effective because of the decreased or possibly sub@@ therapeutic Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ iegel less effective .
when these medicines will be applied together , caution is offered ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical control should be performed because an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of com@@ bust@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous property of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in led to a rise in Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in by 193 % , and thus a rise of the side @-@ related side effects .
if it is required for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in ing along with A@@ gener@@ ase is administ@@ ered to a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data are available .
pharmaceutical in@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not conducted but could be the pl@@ asma seal of both drugs in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of fossil fuel with 200 mg of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily resulted in an increase in the C@@ max of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole at pl@@ asma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ star ) to the 2,@@ 69@@ fold in comparison with the value that was observed after 200 mg ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , in@@ mer or in@@ duc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be applied together with a gener@@ ase , potentially lead to interactions .
patients should therefore be applied to toxic reactions that are associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with aspir@@ ation .
based on the data of other proteins , it is advis@@ able that ant@@ azi@@ da should not be taken at the same time as a gener@@ ase as it may come to res@@ or@@ pho@@ sis .
the simultaneous application of anti @-@ vul@@ si@@ va , which are known as enz@@ ym@@ phen@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degrad@@ ation of the pl@@ asma seal of amber .

the simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can increase substantial harm and increase using P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in related effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and Pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical trial , where Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules , twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ mal daily ) over 7 days at pro@@ ban@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al , while the end@@ ogen@@ ic cort@@ is@@ ol rose by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ con@@ dens@@ ation from 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous property of A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended with o@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ tik@@ oids , unless that the potential benefits of a treatment over@@ weighs the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ial cor@@ tical @-@ effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
at H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a @-@ re@@ fr@@ ase inhibit@@ or such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose inter@@ change@@ ment is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are distinctive to expect cre@@ ase of pl@@ asma seal during temporary delivery .
since Plas@@ mas@@ sm@@ egel@@ gle at this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Redu@@ kt@@ ase inhibit@@ or to my@@ opath@@ y , including a rh@@ ub@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sis , the combined application of these medicines is not recommended .
it is recommended a common monitoring of the therapeutic concentr@@ ations until the stabili@@ zation of the mirror , as the pl@@ asma @-@ concentration of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m can be increased by an equal gift from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied along with or@@ ally h@@ int@@ ed Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while with equal use of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ oc@@ ular inhibit@@ ors point to a possible rise of pl@@ asma prints from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to adjust the 3@@ - to 4 @-@ fold .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is administ@@ ered together with am@@ us@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on oral disease symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r administ@@ ered .
because of the mot@@ if low reliability of historical compar@@ isons can currently no recommendation be given like the Am@@ pren@@ eur@@ r@@ - dose is custom@@ iz@@ able if am@@ us@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous genes of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ alen anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , an enhanced control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ onic Rati@@ o ) is recommended for the possibility of ton@@ ing or rein@@ forcement of the anti @-@ thro@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive is not predic@@ table , therefore alternative methods are recommended for contrac@@ eption .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side @-@ effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants ( for example &apos; Desi@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended when simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .

the further development of the income , including skill and reproduction capacity was not affected by the administration of am@@ entrepren@@ eur@@ r to the mother .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .

on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance @-@ based analyses Gen@@ otyp@@ ical inter@@ pret@@ ations systems can be applied to the estim@@ ation of the activity of Am@@ iga avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with the inf@@ eri@@ or @-@ resist@@ ent isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 @-@ algorith@@ m for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resi@@ li@@ ence as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / L / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / V , I@@ 54@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in combination with a gest@@ ei@@ ght@@ less resistance to Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a decreased probability of a vi@@ rolog@@ ical contact ( resistance ence ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation@@ sm@@ u@@ ster can make changes through additional data and it is advised to always attract the current inter@@ pret@@ ations for analysis of the results of resistance tests .
on ph@@ än@@ otyp@@ ical resistance @-@ based analyses clin@@ ically vali@@ ded ph@@ pret@@ ations systems can be used in conjunction with the prot@@ otyp@@ ical data on estim@@ ating the activity of Am@@ iga avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with the inf@@ eri@@ or @-@ resist@@ ent isol@@ ates .
companies that exp@@ el diagnostic resistance tests , have clin@@ ically @-@ ph@@ än@@ otyp@@ ical Cut @-@ off@@ s ( divi@@ der points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV developed to be applied to the interpretation of results of a resistance test .
each of these four with a decreased sensitivity against amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain element resistant to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity against in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r , but generally preserved .
there are currently data for the cross @-@ resistant between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other Prot@@ ects numbers for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .

in the way round , Am@@ iga is ret@@ ains its activity against some other proteins of the previously @-@ resist@@ ent isol@@ ates ; the conservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the insul@@ ates .
the early intervals of a vers@@ al therapy is advised to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in boundaries which can affect the following treatment .
the cover of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which with PI patients ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ kle@@ osi@@ di@@ alog@@ a ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predomin@@ antly with lower k@@ avi@@ r k@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
single @-@ thir@@ teen ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity compared to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the participation A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ sub@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in terms of time @-@ established average change from the output value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the pl@@ asma ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the pl@@ asma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ remote wave of 0,4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the cover of the effectiveness of inde@@ b@@ oo@@ cy@@ v@@ ap@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials in a total of 288 HIV infected children aged between 2 and 18 years , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution was used to deposit and capsules in doses from 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2,5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the patients to pre @-@ untreated patients had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included in the study included a pl@@ asma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output value .
19 based on this data should be considered in therapy for treatment with PI patients who are considered to be considered to be considered to be considered to be anticipated .
according to oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) up to the maximum value of am@@ us@@ avi@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
5@@ 08 % increases , lo@@ wer@@ ed for C@@ max at 30 % once Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and was administ@@ ered ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal runs to a 25 % reduction in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of pren@@ eur@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) from the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake is influenced by the scale and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent ampli@@ fication volume is about 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves to be a large distribution volume as well as an enormous penetration of the blood circulation into the tissues .
this change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of the active ingredient in the pl@@ asma , with the quantity of in@@ und@@ less pro@@ pren@@ eur@@ r that represents the active part , probably unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of in@@ concei@@ vable amp@@ entrepren@@ eur@@ ant remains constant , the percentage of free active component during d@@ osing inter@@ v@@ alls is dependent on the overall pharmaceutical concentration in the ste@@ el@@ ady state in the Ste@@ ady state via the area of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min .
therefore , medicines that in@@ struct CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or in@@ hib@@ a or a sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution administ@@ ered if they are given at the same time with a gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily sched@@ ules such as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
the solution is 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ change@@ able on a milli@@ gram@@ ine@@ asis .
the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of a kidney failure to be low to the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
this treatment schem@@ ata will lead to Am@@ entrepren@@ avi@@ r @-@ Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ eg@@ s who are sco@@ red on healthy proxy after a dose of 1200 mg of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on the dra@@ ft@@ ogen@@ s of mice and rats , in male animals , h@@ epat@@ oc@@ ular A@@ den@@ ome at dos@@ ages on the s@@ 0 @-@ times ( M@@ ice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Am@@ iga .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ epat@@ oc@@ ular A@@ den@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ ome has not yet been un@@ solved and the relevance of this observed effects for man is un@@ clear .
from the present ex@@ position data on humans , from clinical studies as well as of the therapeutic application , however , little indications of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery from in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial reverse @-@ test tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ l@@ ympho@@ bl@@ m test , micro@@ kern@@ els on rats and chromos@@ ome re@@ formation pro@@ st@@ ling at human periph@@ eral ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ zy@@ ed included , was neither pain nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ically .
these liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and demonstrated in clinical daily life through measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine ph@@ osph@@ at@@ ase .
up to now in clinical studies have been observed no significant liver tox@@ icity in patients , neither during administration of no@@ gener@@ asis still after the end of the treatment .
studies on tox@@ icity in juven@@ iles , which were treated at an age of 4 days showed high mort@@ ality to be treated as well as with Am@@ pren@@ eur@@ r .
in a system@@ ic Plas@@ ma@@ ex@@ position , the significantly under ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dosage , however , have been observed a number of minor changes including Th@@ y@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and minor sk@@ elet@@ on changes , which point to a consumed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fier of k@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses should be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of amp@@ ant capsules / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines up to a day @-@ weight loss of 2400 mg of amp@@ ant medication which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application is to occur in patients with f@@ rail or light liver tumor with caution , in patients with severe liver tumor , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards Rati@@ o ) , methods for determining the drug con@@ centr@@ ation .
it should be set in duration 27 if a rash may be accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or ( see section 4.8 ) .
an elevated risk for a lif@@ ec@@ yst@@ roph@@ y was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and the associated met@@ abolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C caused by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to say that to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a resistance development .
5@@ 08 % increases , low for C@@ max on the other around 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ us@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered .
the C@@ min @-@ values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg ) ( 400 mg ) ( 400 mg ) ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily is administ@@ ered .
a d@@ osing rate for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , there is however a machine @-@ machine vision , since the effectiveness and in@@ concei@@ vable of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ deo in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the ex@@ position of both proteins are concerned .
when these medicines will be applied together , caution is offered ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical control should be performed because an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of com@@ bust@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is required for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in ing along with a gener@@ ase is administ@@ ered to a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data are available .

with simultaneous genes of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ alen anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , an enhanced control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ onic Rati@@ o ) is recommended for the possibility of ton@@ ing or rein@@ forcement of the anti @-@ thro@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Cam@@ re@@ th@@ ind@@ ron ) led to a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ entrepren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this medicine should only be applied during pregnancy only after careful deliber@@ ation for the mother compared to possible risks to the fo@@ etus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a reproduction observ@@ atory that was administ@@ ered by the in@@ feed in the uter@@ us to the end of the lact@@ ation period up to the end of the lact@@ ation period , showed during the lact@@ ation period an dimin@@ ished increase in body weight upon re@@ union .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is attri@@ but@@ able to signs of in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures are taken into account .
the anti@@ vir@@ al activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both ak@@ ut and chronic l@@ ympho@@ cy@@ te cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral cons@@ l@@ ympho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % of in@@ fertility ( IC@@ 50 ) by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is infected in the range from 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ s in acute cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
in the way round , Am@@ iga is ret@@ ains its activity against some other proteins of the previously @-@ resist@@ ent isol@@ ates ; the conservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the insul@@ ates .
based on these data should be considered in the treatment of therapy with PI patients who are considered to be considered to be considered to be considered to be considered to be anticipated .
while the absolute concentration of in@@ concei@@ vable amp@@ pren@@ eur@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component during d@@ osing inter@@ v@@ alls , depending on the overall pharmaceutical concentration in the ste@@ el@@ ady state regarding the area of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss ..
therefore , medicines that in@@ struct CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or in@@ hib@@ a or a sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution administ@@ ered if they are given at the same time with a gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of kidney failure to be low to the elimination of Am@@ iga @-@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .

the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ epat@@ oc@@ ular A@@ den@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ ome has not yet been un@@ solved and the relevance of this observed effects for man is un@@ clear .
from the present ex@@ position data on humans , from clinical studies as well as for the therapeutic application , however , little indications for accepting a clinical relevance of these findings .

studies on tox@@ icity in juven@@ iles , which were treated at an age of 4 days showed high mort@@ ality to be treated as well as with Am@@ pren@@ eur@@ r .
these results can be concluded that in juven@@ iles the met@@ abolic path@@ ways are not fully wi@@ ped out so that am@@ entrepren@@ eur@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( ) .

the bio@@ availability of pren@@ eur@@ r as a solution to inser@@ ting is by 14 % lower than the capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to inser@@ ting on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ change@@ able ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , with taking the solution to inser@@ tion ( see section 4.4 ) .

in addition , because no dose compensation for the simultaneous use of a gener@@ ase solution to take and low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be given this combination of those patients can be avoided .
although a dosage adjustment for pre@@ pren@@ eur@@ r is not necessary for profit is an application of a gener@@ ase solution for income in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic response as a result of high prop@@ ylene gly@@ col@@ eg@@ al@@ ts is a gener@@ ase solution for income in inf@@ ants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced live function or liver fail@@ ures and in patients with kidney failure .
the simultaneous administration may lead to a competent im@@ itation of the met@@ abolic ization of these medicines and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart arr@@ hyth@@ mia ( z .

the application process and the duration of the treatment with Al@@ dara depend on the treat@@ able disease in the genital area , Al@@ dara is open up to a maximum of 16 weeks a three times weekly . • For me@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ rates , it is applied during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks of break between treatment cycles , three times weekly .
the cream is spread in front of bed@@ time thin @-@ lay@@ ered to the affected skin areas so that they remain enough for a long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off .
in all studies , Al@@ dara was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( same cream , but without the substance ) . • Al@@ dara was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area each for 16 weeks .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete storage division of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dara was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bass cell car@@ cin@@ oma in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and al@@ dara or the plac@@ ebo either daily or five times a week .
main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with complete storage division of tum@@ ors after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dara was also tested in two studies in total 505 patients with acute ho@@ at@@ rates .
in all studies Al@@ dara was more effective than plac@@ ebo . • For the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete final rate of patients were treated with plac@@ ebo untreated patients . • The results of the two studies involving plac@@ ebo untreated patients showed a full treat@@ able rate of 66 % to 80 % in patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group .

if it is necessary due to the complaints of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment will be done from several days .
the clinical result of therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the applied skin approximately 12 weeks after the treatment of treatment .
as currently no data about long @-@ term healing rates are available for more than 36 months after treatment should be considered with super@@ fic@@ tional cell car@@ cin@@ ations .

the available data on the me@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ ose on the fore@@ arms and the hands do not support the effectiveness in this field of application , so this application is not recommended .
local Hau@@ chers often appear on , but these reactions usually take back in the course of therapy to intensity , or go after de@@ compos@@ ing the therapy with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cre@@ denti@@ als .
if the local main actions of the patient cause big discomfort or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed to some days .
from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 AK@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons are reduced to less complete healing rate than patients with fewer than 8 lam@@ bs .

in the study , the safety of the drug was examined , however , it was also tested its effectiveness ( by exam@@ ining its effect in the reduction of gene concentr@@ ations in the urine and regarding the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years of aging Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me the AG@@ AG concentr@@ ations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the present kids reported a normal large liver in the end of the study .
the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , sick@@ ness , skin pain , pain pain , pain in the extrem@@ ities ( in hands and feet ) , heat @-@ feeling , fe@@ ver and reactions at the inf@@ usion point .
very common side effects amongst patients under five years are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measured size of the lung function ) , Tach@@ y@@ kar@@ die ( acceler@@ ated heart rate ) , fe@@ ver and sho@@ oters .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be applied in patients who may not be heavily hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) .
the European Drug Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will be released every year all new information , which may be known , and this is required to update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who obtained Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the responses to inf@@ usion and the development of antibodies .
June 2003 , the European Commission given the Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. approval for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me across the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mamm@@ al cell membrane ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , E@@ ier@@ stock of the Chinese Ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is for the long @-@ time enzy@@ me therapy in patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ do@@ sis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase @-@ lack ) indic@@ ative to treat the non @-@ neurological manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be made by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inher@@ ited met@@ abolic disorders .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient is wearing this , every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 e / kg / h can be increased .
the safety and efficacy of ag@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients there can be no d@@ osing scheme .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suff@@ iciency has not been determined , and for these patients no d@@ osing scheme is recommended .
with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , patients may develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions , which are defined as any related side @-@ effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , these patients should continue to be monitored remot@@ ely , and inf@@ usion of ag@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out only in a reasonable clinical setting , at the re @-@ bust@@ ling facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , we expect almost all patients to make Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the commen@@ cement of the commen@@ cement .
patients who develop human antibodies or symptoms of a inf@@ usion in response must be treated with caution when applying Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
since few years of experience regarding the resume of treatment after a longer break , has to be cau@@ ti@@ ous after the theoretical risk reaction after a break of treatment has been careful .
60 minutes before the beginning of inf@@ usion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tica ) to minim@@ ise the potential of inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions .
in the event of easy or medium @-@ severe inf@@ usion related response , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen must be weigh@@ ed and / or a reduction in inf@@ usion rate to half the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe inf@@ usion @-@ related response , the inf@@ usion has to be stopped , until the symptoms are brought to decline , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and Par@@ ac@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be er@@ wä@@ ged .
the inf@@ usion can be recorded with a reduction in inf@@ usion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of inf@@ usion rate , in which the reaction performed , will be added again .
3 will be performed ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction in inf@@ usion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of inf@@ usion rate , in which the reaction performed has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ quin or Proc@@ ain , because there is a potential risk of an inter@@ conference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not let on direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
because no data relating to new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exp@@ on@@ ated against mat@@ ernal milk on the breast milk , is advised to satisfy during the treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
side effects in clinical studies were reported mainly as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions , which were observed at 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study conducted with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
unwanted drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the phase 3@@ - study and their renewal with a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older during a total treatment duration of up to 4 years have been performed in the following table ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
with some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ conditional involvement of the upper respir@@ atory tract and lungs in pre @-@ history , there were heavy reactions to , including bronze bu@@ rial , respir@@ ation and fac@@ tions ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ known drug impacts related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a ph@@ as@@ - 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged 5 years , with mainly severe dis@@ course form and treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg of intraven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg of intraven@@ ous , 200 E / kg of intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg of intraven@@ ous .
for most patients it occurred within 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ o@@ con@@ ical version , whereby the patients aged 5 years with a heavy form of ma@@ ids usually came within a month to a Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version ( average after 26 days to 45 days for patients aged 5 years and older ) .
until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature exp@@ editions from the study ) were not found by radio immun@@ om@@ op@@ at@@ itation ( RI@@ P ) As@@ say thought@@ ful antibodies , among them 3 patients , in which it was never released on ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with error @-@ up to lower antibodies is a robust reduction in the G@@ AG Spi@@ eg@@ els in the Har@@ n while in patients with high antibodies to establish a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the har@@ n .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ ally up to low NEU@@ TRA@@ LI@@ ZZ@@ AN@@ inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ - activity in vit@@ ro that seemed to not inter@@ f@@ ere the clinical effectiveness and / or reducing G@@ AG in the har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to stand in connection with the incidence of undes@@ irable medicines , even if the appearance of undes@@ irable pharmac@@ euticals typically fell together with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzy@@ me therapy is in one for the Hy@@ d@@ rol@@ y@@ sis of the accum@@ ulated sub@@ str@@ ate and the prevention of a further accumulation of adequate restoration of the acceler@@ ation .
according to intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and recorded by cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omen , most likely over Mann@@ osis @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me have been assessed in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ eable phase @-@ 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study that was reported to the entire crane spectrum , the majority of patients were of the Middle phen@@ otype and only a patient referred to the heavy phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had an acceler@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ relevant volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary outcomes for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute secret circuit in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension , where they received further 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me to improve the lung function and the hearing conduc@@ tivity in the following table is shown .
in the open extensions study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and of 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as derived from the following table .
the decrease of the expected percentage FE@@ V is not significant about this period of clin@@ ically and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary vol@@ um@@ ina increased further proportional to the body @-@ size of growing children .
from 26 patients with a Hep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly , the treatment reached a normal living size 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a clear decrease of the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was fixed until the end of the year .
with regard to the het@@ ero@@ genic path@@ ogen@@ ic between patients , which has been considered by using a combined end@@ point , the clin@@ ically significant changes ( however , in the 6 @-@ minute walk , movement area of the shoulder @-@ gel@@ en@@ ks A@@ HI and Pl@@ aces ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration of 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year @-@ year @-@ 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and phar@@ yn@@ ge@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their intake ( 16 patients with the heavy form of form ) and 4 with the moderate in@@ box form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased due to increased G@@ AG@@ - mir@@ rors in the har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
for several patients there was a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( s = 3 ) found after the Z @-@ Score ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the moderate in@@ feed form referred to , whereas in the elderly patients with severe dis@@ course form only limited or even no progress in cogn@@ itive development were as@@ cert@@ ained .
in a phase @-@ 4 study , investigations into the pharmac@@ eu@@ tic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ met@@ ering schem@@ ata were conducted at the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in the Har@@ n , the Leb@@ er@@ volume and the 6 @-@ minutes hearing test .
100 E / kg of intraven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg of intraven@@ ous , 200 E / kg of intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg of intraven@@ ous .
the d@@ osing scheme with 200 E / kg of intraven@@ ous 2 weeks may be patients who have difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions ; however , is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two doses schem@@ ata is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available every year , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .

A@@ lim@@ ta is applied together with Cis@@ plat@@ in ( a different medicine against cancer ) , if the cancer is un@@ stress@@ ful &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant ) , cancer has already spread far on other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non@@ slip &quot; lung cancer , which is not attacks imp@@ el cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not been treated before , in combination with cis@@ plat@@ in and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies previously .
to reduce side effects , patients should take in treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and inj@@ ections from vitamin B@@ 12 .
when A@@ lim@@ ta is administ@@ ered together with cis@@ plat@@ in , should before or after the gift of Cis@@ plat@@ in in addition an &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um &quot; ( drug to break ) and liqui@@ ds .
in patients whose blood picture changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be up@@ lifted , dism@@ issed or the dose decre@@ ases .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed cle@@ ave the formation of DNA and RNA and prevent the cells divide .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed to its active form is easier by giving than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentr@@ ations of the active form of medication and prolonged activity of cancer cells .
for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ cell lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study on 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , which had previously been dealt with chemotherapy with chemotherapy ( other medicines for cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta also was compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( a further medicine against cancer ) , and both in combination with cis@@ plat@@ in , in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ plat@@ in , survived average 12.@@ 1 months , compared with 9,@@ 3 months in the single administration of cis@@ plat@@ in .
in patients who previously had previously received chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,@@ 3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
however , in both studies however , patients in which cancer is not included with the epith@@ el@@ ial cells , in administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival life than with the same @-@ like drug .
September 2004 the European Commission divided the company El@@ i Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. a licence for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
any v@@ ant@@ age bottle has to be solved with 4.2 ml 0,9 % iger so@@ dium hydro@@ chlori@@ de ( 9 mg / ml ) - which results a solution from 25 mg / ml .
the appropriate volume of the necessary do@@ - sis will be taken from the break@@ down bottle and with 0,9 % iger so@@ dium hydro@@ chlori@@ de ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .

ALI@@ M@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is displayed for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - k@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ specific bron@@ chi@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body space is administ@@ ered as intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion for a period of 10 minutes the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ plat@@ in amounts to 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as inf@@ usion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - inf@@ usion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with uns@@ killed Bron@@ chi@@ al@@ kar@@ zin@@ om in previous chemotherapy the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administ@@ ered as intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion for a period of 10 minutes the first day of every 21 @-@ day treat .
to reduction the frequency and sever@@ ity of home interactions it must be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed G@@ abe , as well as on the day after the treatment a cor@@ tico .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ared must be taken at least 5 cans of fol@@ ate and the intake must continue throughout the treatment of therapy and for another 21 days following the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate dosage .
patients also need to receive an in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular inj@@ ecting vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dosage and after every third em@@ ir@@ ation cycle .
in patients who receive P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , every gift should be created a complete blood @-@ picture , including a differenti@@ ation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a plat@@ elet .
the al@@ kal@@ ische phosph@@ or@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ anin @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dosage of dosage must take place under ber@@ il@@ isation of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood flow or the maximum non @-@ h@@ ä@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity of the previous therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the notes in tables 1 , 2 and 3 to apply for ALI@@ M@@ TA as a monopol@@ y or in combination with cis@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute common tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 ble@@ eding .
should patients not develop @-@ h@@ ä@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity 3@@ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted by ALI@@ M@@ TA , until the patient is the value before treatment
the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled , if in patients after 2 dos@@ ages , a h@@ ä@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ h@@ ä@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity degree 3 or 4 occurs , or so@@ - continued during the appearance of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 years or compared to patients aged 65 years , an increased side @-@ level ris@@ i@@ - ko consists .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data about in@@ consistency and effectiveness .
clinical trials were not required in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance of ISO 45 ml / min no tin @-@ adap@@ tions necessary to go beyond that for all patients recommended dosage adjustment .
the data base in patients with a circular flow of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a live @-@ functioning bro@@ k@@ ation of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - Grenz@@ wer@@ tes and / or trans@@ amin@@ as@@ en@@ ames of &gt; 0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( at Ab@@ - Wes@@ ole of liver metastatic ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 @-@ times of the upper limit level ( in the presence of liver metastatic ) not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to bone mark@@ ings , and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed can not be administ@@ ered to patients before their absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ atel@@ ic number one value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - zy@@ re number has achieved a value of around 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose @-@ reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ anthrop@@ ic acid , Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ds and maxim@@ ally non @-@ h@@ ä@@ mat@@ ologically tox@@ icity , as seen in the previous treatment cycles - ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of the degree 3 / 4 h@@ ä@@ mat@@ ological and non @-@ th@@ ae@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity like ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie , feb@@ ru@@ ary Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and Inf@@ ection with Grad 3 / 4 Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was taken when a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients need to be instruc@@ ted with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as the proph@@ etic lak@@ tic measure to apply poverty @-@ related tox@@ icity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous prescription of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti ph@@ rology ( &gt; 1.3 g. daily ) for at least 2 days before therapy , in the day of therapy and min@@ de@@ - tens 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients , intended for treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is required to intake of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ time treatment for at least 5 days before therapy , in the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred , had corresponding risk factors for the appearance of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ based hyper@@ tension or Diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liqui@@ ds - accumulation of the trans@@ cell@@ ular space a dra@@ inage of the result before the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment would be weigh@@ ed .
5 severe Car@@ di@@ ovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ path@@ ine , and dec@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical trials of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally if this substance is usually administ@@ ered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ alties ( except yellow fe@@ ver , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of irre@@ versible injuries is possible by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed prescribed by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised to obtain advice in terms of sperm count .
in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance connects 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti ph@@ logi@@ sti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid in high doses ( 1.2 1.3 g. daily ) to a decreased po@@ em@@ et@@ re exp@@ ul@@ sion with the result of an increased appearance of side effects .
therefore , caution is advis@@ able when patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance can be applied for 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid in high doses .

since no data can be reported regarding the transaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ time ic@@ ons such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ f@@ ec@@ ox@@ ib , the simultaneous application with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for at least 5 days before therapy , in the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual variation of the Ger@@ inn@@ ungs@@ status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ zi@@ en and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ ic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Standards Rati@@ o ) when the decision was made to treat the patient en@@ acted with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed tri@@ mm@@ ers in pregnant women , but as for an@@ de@@ - or instructions can be treated with an application in pregnancy heavy birth defects .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is not to be applied during pregnancy , except if strictly explanations and after careful dis@@ inf@@ ation for the mother and risk for the fo@@ etus ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of irre@@ versible damage of the reproductive capacity is made by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised prior to the treatment course before the commen@@ cement of the treatment before the commen@@ cement of the treatment .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed re@@ eds in the mother &apos;s milk and unwanted effects by stri@@ pped ac@@ ward cannot be ruled out .

alli should not be used by children and juven@@ iles under 18 , as there is insufficient data for the effectiveness and safety .
since Or@@ list@@ at is only minimal res@@ or@@ ously , is at el@@ der and in patients with reduced , liver and / or ren@@ al function no adjustment of the dosage is necessary .
• App@@ o@@ iti@@ vity to the active ingredient or any other components • simultaneous treatment with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Chron@@ icles • pregnancy ( see section 4.6 ) • simultaneous treatment with warning or other or@@ alen anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.8 )
the probability of occurrence of gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase if alli is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meals or fat @-@ rich diet .
as the weight reduction in diabetes can go to diabetes with improved met@@ abolic control , patients should consult a medicine against diabetes , before starting a therapy with alli made a doctor or a pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage must be adapted to the anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic .
patients who take care as well as medicines for hyper@@ tension or an increased cholesterol levels should consult their physician or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage must be adapted to these medicines .

both in a study to interactions between drugs and in several cases with simultaneous application of Or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed a lo@@ wering of the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in pl@@ asma seal .
when applying War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with Or@@ list@@ at could be affected the Quick @-@ values ( international norm@@ ative rati@@ o , IN@@ R ) ( see section 4.8 ) .
in most patients who have been treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with Or@@ list@@ at , the concentr@@ ations of the vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta car@@ ot@@ ins remained in the standard area .
however , patients should be recommended to take advantage of the mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement in order to ensure sufficient ob@@ amination . ( see section 4.4 ) .
following the gift of a single mal@@ function A@@ mi@@ od@@ ar@@ on was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers , who were at the same time Or@@ list@@ at , observed a slight decrease of the A@@ mi@@ od@@ ar@@ on Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation .
animal experimental trials showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic , fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ ale development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of Or@@ list@@ at are mainly Gastro@@ intest@@ inal nature and are connected with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , because the absorption of un@@ perceived fat is prevented .
the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal side effects were determined from clinical studies with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and generally was light and temporary .
the hi@@ des are as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the data available not in@@ estim@@ able ) .
the frequency of wor@@ rying side effects which were detected after the launch of Or@@ list@@ at , is unknown because these events were voluntarily reported by a population un@@ certain size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with alli can lead to anxiety in view of possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal effects .
individual d@@ osing of 800 mg Or@@ list@@ at and multi @-@ luggage lock@@ ers from up to 400 mg three times a day have been administ@@ ered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects , without significant clinical ass@@ ad@@ ts .
in the majority of the cases reported after the market launch reported cases of Or@@ list@@ at @-@ over@@ dose , either no side effects or similar side effects were reported as in the recommended dose of Or@@ list@@ at .
based on investigations on humans and animals can be prec@@ eded by a rapid rel@@ at@@ roph@@ y system@@ ic effects that is attri@@ but@@ able to the li@@ ent properties of Or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect continues in the lum@@ ens of the Mag@@ ens and the upper d@@ une area by kov@@ al@@ ente ties to the active ser@@ in @-@ rest of the gast@@ ric and pan@@ cre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ en .
from clinical studies was derived that 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ at , three times daily , the absorption of about 25 % of the food is blocked .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ized , plac@@ eb@@ ok@@ ont@@ rol@@ ed studies in adults with a BM@@ I bite 28 kg / m2 prevail over the effectiveness of 60 mg Or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times daily in combination with a hyp@@ ok@@ al@@ or@@ tic , fet@@ tered food .
the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the output value ( at the time of random ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in degree in degree ( Table 1 ) and as part of those students who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their cur@@ weight ( table 2 ) .
although in both studies the weight reduction has been observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss entered the first 6 months .
the average change in total cholesterol was equivalent to Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( worth $ 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( outlet 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of the L@@ DL cholesterol amo@@ unted with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3,5 % ( output : 3.30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( output value 3,@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

chemical otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are examined 81 % of patients who were treated with alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of the patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron to patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
with a comparison with Dol@@ c@@ et@@ ron these values are at 63 % for Alo@@ jam@@ x ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ c@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
March 2005 , the European Commission granted the Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd . approval for the transport of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indi@@ ces : to the prevention of acute sick@@ ness and v@@ om@@ iting at heavily em@@ et@@ ogen@@ s chemotherapy due to cancer disease and to the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in ly em@@ et@@ ogen@@ ic chemotherapy due to cancer disease .
the effectiveness of alo@@ xi for the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , which is indu@@ ces by a strongly em@@ et@@ ogen@@ ic chemotherapy can be reinforced by adding any prior chemotherapy Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids .
because Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on pro@@ sy , patients should be monitored with an am@@ nest@@ an ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or sign of a sub@@ aki I@@ le@@ us after the injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is offered with simultaneous genes by Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with drugs that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which Q@@ t@@ - interval is extended or the lead to such pro@@ long@@ ation .
except in connection with a further chemical physi@@ otherap@@ ies , Alo@@ xi should neither be used in the days after chemotherapy nor to prevention nor treatment of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
in clinical trials in@@ hibit Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , against tum@@ ors of five studied chemical otherap@@ eu@@ tics ( cis@@ plat@@ in , cycl@@ oph@@ osph@@ amide , cy@@ lin@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ological mental effect between a unique intraven@@ ous dosage Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ el@@ ady concentration of met@@ o@@ cl@@ op@@ r@@ ami@@ ds , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in a based on a population of based pharmac@@ ological analysis was shown that the simultaneous property of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ Indu@@ str@@ ine ( A@@ mi@@ od@@ ar@@ on , C@@ elec@@ ox@@ ib , flu@@ oxet@@ ine , hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , serv@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ aline and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences regarding the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies are not available , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied at pregnant women , unless it is necessary from the treat@@ able doctor as necessary .
clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 mc@@ g . observed side effects ( total 6@@ 33 patients ) who were at least possibly associated with Alo@@ jam@@ ala related , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of over@@ sensitivity and reactions to the administration city ( burning , curing , discomfort and pain ) were indicated in post @-@ marketing experience .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar pre@@ figures of undes@@ irable events as in the other d@@ osing groups ; there were no dose of action to observe .
there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies conducted due to the large distribution of di@@ aly@@ sis , however , there is probably no effective therapy for alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies were total of 1.@@ 132 patients , which received a moderate em@@ et@@ ric chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 Cycl@@ oph@@ osph@@ amide and 250 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg of mic@@ ron ( half @-@ day 3 hours ) or 100 mg dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7,@@ 3 hours ) , which was given on day 1 without D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ ron intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ised double blind , a total of 6@@ 67 patients , which received a strongly em@@ et@@ ent chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ Cis@@ plat@@ inum , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cycl@@ oph@@ osph@@ amide and dac@@ ar@@ b@@ azin and 250 or 750 mc@@ g of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron received patients who were 32 mg On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron which were given on the day one intraven@@ ous .
studies of studies with ly em@@ et@@ ogen@@ s chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ et@@ ogen@@ s chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical studies for indication chemotherapy in@@ duced nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and E@@ KG parameters including the Q@@ T@@ c inter@@ v@@ alls with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ c@@ et@@ ron .
according to the findings of pre @-@ clin@@ ically investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the I@@ on@@ ary channels and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular channels and leng@@ then the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out by 221 healthy Pro@@ ban@@ den study was the assessment of the E@@ KG @-@ effects of I.@@ v. administ@@ ered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in individual d@@ oses of 0,25 , 0,75 and 2,25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous G@@ abe follows an initial decrease of the pl@@ asma @-@ centr@@ ations a slow elimination of the body with an average @-@ time half @-@ time period of about 40 hours .
the average maximum Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally associated in the entire dose area of 0,@@ 3@@ - 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
according to intraven@@ ous demand of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , at 11 Ho@@ den@@ kar@@ zin@@ om@@ pati@@ enten ren@@ dering between day 1 and day 5 ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ mak@@ ocr@@ in@@ etic simul@@ ations emerged , that the current intraven@@ ous form of 0.25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has reached three consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with which according to non @-@ recur@@ ring figure was comparable ; however , the C@@ max is higher after the addition of 0,75 mg higher .
about 40 % will be eliminated over the kid@@ neys , and some 50 % will be converted into two primary met@@ abolic path@@ ologic compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ ors .
in @-@ vit@@ ro studies for met@@ abolic studies have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lesser extent , the I@@ so@@ enz@@ ym@@ es CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 on the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were re@@ found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ change@@ able substance made about 40 % of the given dosage .
after a unique intraven@@ ous bol@@ ts for healthy was the overall physical clear@@ ance 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ ale Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
while patients with severe liver tumor , the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ lands increases and the average system@@ ic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in clinical trials , effects were observed only after extru@@ sion , which are regarded as adequate above the maximum human@@ istic exposure , which indicates a small relevance to clinical use .
10 From clinical trials are evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block into very high concentration of con@@ greg@@ ations , which can pro@@ hibit the v@@ entri@@ cular DE@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation and may extend the action of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( every dose correspon@@ ded to about the total of the therapeutic exposure to humans ) which have been given daily over two years , resulted in an increased incidence of liver cir@@ cl@@ ine ( in thy@@ ro@@ id , p@@ itu@@ itary , pan@@ cre@@ as , cre@@ ep@@ en@@ en@@ mark ) , and Hau@@ tt@@ um@@ ae with rats , but not with mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the used high d@@ osing and since Alo@@ jam@@ ien@@ ces designed for a unique application , the relevance of these results will be assessed as for humans .

June 2006 adopted the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ t@@ tend ( CH@@ MP ) a negative report , in which the approval of the approval for the transport of h@@ epatitis C is recommended for the treatment of h@@ epatitis C / ml injection .
this means that al@@ eon of a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A should be similar to the same therapeutic range that is already approved in the EU ( also &quot; Reference App@@ lications &quot; ) .
al@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long an@@ hal@@ ved ) Hepatitis C ( one caused by a vir@@ al infection ) .
with a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic investigation , the liver tissue points out , moreover , the value of the liver enz@@ ym@@ es Al@@ an@@ in Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) increases in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of the substance .
the manufacturer of al@@ ph@@ eon included data that occupy the comparison of al@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A evidence ( substance structure , composition and pur@@ ity of the drug , mode , safety and effectiveness of h@@ epatitis C ) .
in the study conducted in patients with h@@ epatitis C , the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ eon has been compared to the effectiveness of the reference procedure using 455 patients .
the study was measured on how many patients said after 12 out of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment applied to the drug ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is provided for non commercial law only provided the E@@ MEA is , What were the greatest concern that CH@@ MP recommendation to fail ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , concerns raised to the stability of the substance and the drug market is not sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the number of patients with h@@ epatitis C patients who spoke to the treatment with al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A treatment was similar in clinical study .
after the treatment with al@@ eon , the disease wor@@ shipped the disease with more patients than with the reference temperature ; moreover , al@@ eon had increased side effects .
apart from that , the trial was introduced in the study to investigate the issue , however , the drug forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) is not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it may be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go ( one with cr@@ acking infection ) and small infected in@@ tox@@ icity ( R@@ iss@@ - or beak ) , sc@@ ents and stit@@ ching wo@@ unds are applied .
al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections , indic@@ ative or pres@@ um@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resist@@ ent for@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go could not work against this kind of infections .
al@@ loc@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but patients under the age of 18 must not amount to be treated more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not contradi@@ ct the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should consider the patient once again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by block@@ ers of the bacter@@ i@@ ales Ri@@ bos@@ om ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and in@@ hibit the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection had ended after the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2,@@ 1 % ) of 71 patients suffering from plac@@ ebo spoke to treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin @-@ birds , Al@@ tar@@ go and Cef@@ alex@@ in similar response : if the results of both studies were collected at Hau@@ tw@@ unden , about 90 % of the patients of both groups expressed .
in these two studies however , however , that Al@@ tar@@ go was caused in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( eit@@ er@@ filled hol@@ low habitats in the body tissues ) or by infections that were evi@@ den@@ ced or pres@@ um@@ ably caused by MR@@ SA , are not effective enough .
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation on the order .
the committee for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) landed at the conclusion that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go over the following super@@ ficial skin infections towards the risks over@@ weigh : • Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go , • in@@ izing small in@@ lets , sk@@ ir@@ ed or se@@ wn wo@@ unds .
may 2007 the European Commission granted the Group Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . approved for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go to the entire European Union .
patients who have no improvement within two to three days should still be investigated and will be considered as an alternative therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the event of raising or severe local irrit@@ ation by the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment has been canc@@ eled , the sal@@ is carefully ref@@ unded and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection will commen@@ ce .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not intended to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as a path@@ ogen or is suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies with secondary open wo@@ unds was the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections , which were caused by an meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in drug @-@ resistant ge@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
an alternative therapy is to be considered if after a 2 to 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected place occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low pl@@ asma concentration , which have been achieved by people according to top@@ ical application in the sc@@ and@@ ed skin or infected super@@ ficial wo@@ unds , is a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo not to expect ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 Acc@@ essi@@ onal gift from 2 @-@ times a daily 200 mg ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the middle ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be at the me@@ ager skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the small system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients will not be considered if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproduction symp@@ tom after oral in@@ gest@@ ion and are inadequate in terms of a statement on the birth and the federal structures / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be should be applied during pregnancy , if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indic@@ ative and applying ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin use of the gift of a system@@ ic Anti@@ biot@@ ic .
when deciding whether the breast@@ feeding continues / ends , or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued , between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the baby and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for woman .
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go , was the most commonly reported side effect of irrit@@ ation in administration , which concerned about 1 % of patients .
it ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ atives of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance , which is carried through fer@@ mentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ agi@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the ingredient of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhibit@@ ing of the bacterial prot@@ ein@@ synthesis by interaction on a specific bond of the 50 sub @-@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ om , which diff@@ ers from the bonds of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti @-@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the relation of the bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the Bos@@ nian EPP Group and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase@@ Centre .
by bond at this bond in@@ hibit P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , blocking partial P @-@ bond interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ic sub@@ units .
should , due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin , at least some infectious forms seem to be deemed necessary , a consultation by experts should be pursued .
there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ate is sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the case of non @-@ speaking to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us the presence of tribes should be considered with additional Vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) .
re@@ discovery In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was carried out daily under Oc@@ clusi@@ on on intact and de@@ ported skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days to the top@@ ical treatment of secondary trau@@ mat@@ ic wo@@ unds , single Plas@@ m@@ apro@@ bs were won .
the sampling took place on days 3 or 4 in adult patients each prior to the medication and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system inclusion in people after top@@ ical application of 1 % sal@@ be on 200 c@@ m2 be@@ amed skin ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 @-@ times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP shirt .
Met@@ abol@@ ism The in vit@@ ro oxid@@ ative met@@ abolic disorders of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human@@ ic liver melan@@ omas was primarily given in CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under little participation of CY@@ P2@@ C8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on the oral tox@@ icity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ ro@@ id changes .

Ambi@@ rix deals with the protection against Hepatitis A and h@@ epatitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children between the ages of one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is applied within two doses of existing vaccines , whereby the protection against Hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix cannot be used only when immun@@ isation is a low risk of h@@ epatitis B infection and is ensured that the vaccine itself can be conducted from two doses .
if a refres@@ her dose is for Hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix can be given or another h@@ epatitis A@@ - or B vaccine .
vaccines have an effect by bringing the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) &quot; how it can blow up against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system re@@ alis@@ es the viruses and surface @-@ anti@@ gens as &quot; strange &quot; and creates anti@@ body against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as that since 1996 , Twin@@ rix adults and the approved vaccine Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vaccines are used for protection against the same illness , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ k children are administ@@ ered within a three cans of existing vaccines .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults include several of the data that utili@@ zes the application of Twin@@ Trans@@ rix , even as a test@@ ament to the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective instrument for the last injection .
in an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix resulted in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection in the development of protective antibodies against h@@ epatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the level of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to a se@@ chs@@ - and at a 12 @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccines ) are head@@ ache , App@@ et@@ it@@ man@@ gel , pain at the inj@@ ecting site , red@@ ness , mat@@ ernal ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix must not be sensitive to patients who may be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) can not be applied .

the Stand@@ ardi@@ ari@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vaccines , whereby the first dose of the appointment of the choice and the second dose is administ@@ ered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination is required for Hepatitis A as well as h@@ epatitis B can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vaccines or with a combin@@ ation@@ ent mechanism .
the anti @-@ h@@ epatitis A @-@ h@@ epatitis and anti @-@ h@@ epatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ h@@ epatitis A @-@ virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibodies are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ als .
it is not yet completely secured , whether immun@@ o @-@ capable people who need on a h@@ epatitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination , as they may not be protected in any more det@@ ectable antibodies that may not be protected by immun@@ ological memory .
3 As with any inj@@ ections should be immediately available for the rare case of an an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the approval of the vaccine , according to the approval of medical treatment and monitoring .
if a fast protection against h@@ epatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended to the standardi@@ zed h@@ epatitis A @-@ A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B @-@ surface area .
with hem@@ or@@ aly@@ sis and persons with disorders of the immune system , under certain conditions , no enough anti @-@ HA@@ V@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies can be achieved so that in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be required .
as an intra@@ oral injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration , in the glut@@ e@@ al muscle could lead to a sub@@ optimal vaccine success , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
in Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ to@@ pen@@ ie or blood @-@ inn@@ ed disorders , Ambi@@ rix cannot be inj@@ ected prefer@@ ably sub@@ cut@@ aneous in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift .
if Ambi@@ rix spent in the form of a separate injection , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ul@@ ä@@ rem Per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vaccine ( D@@ T@@ Pa @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined mas@@ ern@@ - m@@ umps @-@ tube vaccine was the immune response to all anti@@ gens enough ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immun@@ defects must be assumed that potentially have not been sufficient immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ in@@ ants of this formulation with adults , the incidence of pain , red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , head@@ ache and fe@@ ver is comparable to incidence that was observed in the former Thi@@ om@@ ers@@ al@@ - and preser@@ v@@ ative vaccines .
in clinical trials 20@@ 29 vaccines , Ambi@@ rix was administ@@ ered at a total of 10@@ 27 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ cans of combin@@ ation@@ .
the only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and kindness based on a calculation basis per vacc@@ do@@ sis Ambi@@ rix , but not based on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0,7 % of the subjects compared with 39.@@ 1 % in the subjects following the approval of a dose of the 3 @-@ cans of combin@@ ation@@ .
after the complete vacc@@ ination reported 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects , which had gotten Ambi@@ rix over pain , over 6@@ 3,@@ 8 % in the subjects that have been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ tin @-@ process combin@@ ation@@ ent .
the frequency of Mat@@ ousness was however comparable in size ( i.e. over the whole vacc@@ ination with 39.@@ 6 % of the subjects that have received ambi@@ rix , compared to 36.@@ 2 % in the subjects that received the 3 @-@ boxes similar to the subjects ) .
the incidence of pre@@ valence pain and mat@@ in@@ iness was low and comparable to , which was observed according to administration of the combination @-@ vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses vaccine .
in a compar@@ ative study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year vacc@@ inations , the appearance of loc@@ alization actions and general interactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that which was observed with administration with the 3 @-@ split @-@ combin@@ ation@@ ary with 360 ELISA @-@ units form@@ al@@ in@@ ized h@@ epatitis A @-@ A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B @-@ surface area .
at the 6@@ - to 11@@ - year @-@ old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a common occurrence of pain ( at the inj@@ ections ) per dose , not per Pro@@ band , reported .
the proportion of vaccines , which are reported via serious side @-@ effects during the 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ inations with 360 ELI@@ SA@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated h@@ epatitis A @-@ A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis A , was stati@@ stically different .
in clinical trials , which were conducted at vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to 15 years , the ser@@ o @-@ con@@ quest@@ rian rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9,@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administ@@ ered dosage ( d. h. in month 7 ) .
the ser@@ o @-@ con@@ quest@@ rian rates for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4,@@ 2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administ@@ ered dosage ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study carried out at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were combined with three doses .
for the 28@@ 9 persons , whose imm@@ unity was valuable , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ary rates ( SP in the table below ) against h@@ epatitis B in the month 2 and 6 according to G@@ abe des 3 @-@ Dos@@ en@@ im@@ pf@@ oplast@@ ic significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune response , which were achieved in a clinical trial study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ year a month after the end of the full vacc@@ ination ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vacc@@ inations were either a 2 @-@ C@@ ans @-@ vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ phase @-@ vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated h@@ epatitis A @-@ A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B @-@ surface area .
in those who were at the time of pri@@ di@@ mm@@ ed between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ HA@@ V@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies have been proven to be proven at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 month vaccine .
the immun@@ ological campaign against both anti@@ gens were comparable to that , which was detected after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combined h@@ epat@@ oc@@ form@@ - A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B @-@ surface area in a dose of 0,5 ml .
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - to including 15 years of year , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ HA@@ V@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies to be comparable to immun@@ isation within the 0 @-@ 6@@ - months @-@ vaccine may be compared to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months phase .
if the first dose of ambi@@ ance in the second year , with the refres@@ her vacc@@ ination of a combined Di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vaccine ( D@@ T@@ Pa @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined mask @-@ m@@ umps vaccine administ@@ ered it was the immune response to all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study , which was conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation of adults , showed for the present formulation of similar Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ omes and Ser@@ o@@ con@@ versions as for the former formulation .

the h@@ epatitis A virus is usually transmitted by vir@@ al foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other paths , such as swimming in through waste water contamin@@ ated waters .
you may feel very tired , have a dark original , a p@@ ale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yellow ) and other symptoms which may possibly make a stationary treatment .
as with all vaccines , Ambi@@ rix cannot completely protect against infection with h@@ epatitis A@@ - or h@@ epatitis B virus , even if the full vaccine has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child are infected before the administration of both vaccines , Ambi@@ rix are already infected with h@@ epatitis A@@ - or h@@ epatitis B virus ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill / feels ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections that cause the liver damage or symptoms which are similar to those following h@@ epatitis A@@ - or h@@ epatitis B infection can not be taught .
• if you have already shown an allergic reaction to ambi@@ que or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express through it@@ ching rash , respir@@ atory or an@@ dic &apos;s face or tongue . • if with you / your child has performed an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against h@@ epatitis A or h@@ epatitis B . • if you / your child has a serious infection with fe@@ ver .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against Hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usually made administration of the second vacc@@ ination ) .
at a possible risk of infection with h@@ epatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child of a vaccine with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend that you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined h@@ epatitis A@@ - / h@@ epatitis B vaccine with a decreased content of effective components per vaccine dose ( 360 ELISA units of a formal h@@ epatitis A @-@ virus and 10 micro@@ gram of a combined h@@ epatitis B @-@ surface treatment ) .
the second vacc@@ ination of this vaccine with decreased content is usually administ@@ ered one month after the first dose and may give you a vacc@@ in@@ ction before the end of the vaccine .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix will suffer from heavy cl@@ ots , under the skin and not in the muscle tissues . • if you are weak@@ ened / your child due to illness or treatment in your / her cell resistance , or if you / your child are under@@ going to be a her@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix cannot be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons on the vacc@@ ination cannot be sufficient so that a blood test can be necessary to see how strong the reaction is to vacc@@ ination .
21 Now you take your doctor if you take your child to take additional medicinal products ( including those that you have received without prescription ) , or if you / your child have recently been vacc@@ inated / has been given or immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins ( antibodies ) have been planned , or this is planned in the near future .
but it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both h@@ epatitis A and B virus .
if any other vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as possible from different extrem@@ ities .
if Ambi@@ rix should be administ@@ ered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or nursing women will not be administ@@ ered unless it is urgent to vacc@@ inated both against Hepatitis A and h@@ epatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible .
as usual ( more than 1 case per 10 per@@ im@@ ed doses ) : • pain or complaints at the st@@ ich@@ ar or red@@ ness • Mat@@ iness • En@@ z@@ ability • Head@@ ache • App@@ et@@ it@@ man@@ gel
service often ( up to 1 case per 10 per@@ im@@ ed doses ) : • sw@@ elling at the inj@@ ections • F@@ ie@@ ber ( via 38 ° C ) • Ben@@ ef@@ ness • gast@@ ro @-@ intest@@ ines
further side effects that have been reported for days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with compar@@ ative combin@@ ation@@ - or sub@@ st@@ itutes for Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B very rare ( less than one case per 10,000 contrac@@ ted cans ) are :
these cover local limited or extensive pay@@ out , the ju@@ cks can or be bl@@ amed , sw@@ elling of the eyeb@@ row and face , inf@@ eri@@ or , or si@@ zing , sudden blood pressure and consciousness .

23 Inform@@ ing your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if any of the listed side effects you / your child has significantly dimin@@ ished or you may notice side effects which are not specified in this package .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data that have been known since issu@@ ing the first approval for the transport , the CH@@ MP opinion that the value @-@ risk @-@ ratio for Ambi@@ rix continues .
since Ambi@@ rix only spent in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine are limited because of the low patient position .
Ammon@@ aps can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ complete en@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ective or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ial en@@ cephal@@ opath@@ y ( brain damage , as a result of high ammon@@ ium concentration ) in pre @-@ history .
Ammon@@ aps is divided - split into several single tro@@ users to meals - swal@@ lowed under the food or via a neuro@@ stom@@ ata ( through the abdom@@ inal ceiling into the stomach of a leading tube ) or a nas@@ og@@ onde ( through the nose in the stomach of a leading tube ) .
it was not a compar@@ ative study , as Ammon@@ aps not compared to any other treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a hy@@ po@@ que ament that is called without substance ) .
Ammon@@ aps also may lead to App@@ et@@ it@@ eness , a ab@@ normal pur@@ ity , head@@ ache , head@@ ache , liqui@@ dity , li@@ ken@@ ess , v@@ om@@ iting , anxiety , rash , rash , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , or weight gain .
the committee for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) att@@ ained to the conclusion that Ammon@@ aps in patients with disorders of the ure@@ tic @-@ cycle on high ammon@@ i@@ asis has been effectively prevented .
Ammon@@ aps was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; as due to the rar@@ ity of the illness at the time of approval , approval was limited to this medicine .
the use is indigenous to all patients where a complete en@@ f@@ ym@@ man@@ gel is already manifest@@ ed in a new@@ born age ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a bel@@ ated form ( in@@ complete end met@@ abolic disease , which man@@ if@@ ests itself after the first life cycle ) there is an indication of the use when in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opath@@ y exists .
for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with slip dysfunction , AM@@ MONA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form .
the daily dose is individually calculated with consideration of the protein toler@@ ance and the growth and development of the patients in the daily intake of patients .
according to previous clinical experience , normal daily dose @-@ dose is so@@ dium levels : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as income @-@ growing and adult .
in patients who suffer from an early lack of car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate bladder or Or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ f , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or Arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0,@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an Arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ ucc@@ in@@ at@@ synthetic deficiency have to gain arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0,4 - 0,7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be administ@@ ered patients with slip dysfunction , as a risk for the emergence of o@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a exists when the tablets are not immediately visible in the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium yl@@ but@@ y@@ ri@@ but@@ ary that is equivalent to maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS should therefore be applied in patients with con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure and severe kidney failure and o@@ de@@ formation of clinical trials only with caution .
since Met@@ abol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at over the liver and the kid@@ neys occur , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should only be applied with patients with liver or kidney failure .
the meaning of these results in reference to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
with sub@@ cut@@ aneous Iron S@@ abe by phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate on young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ ing of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and to a disturbed loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a consuming irrit@@ ation of crus@@ hing syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning neur@@ ons in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate will take into the mother &apos;s milk , and for that reason the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lact@@ ation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trial with AM@@ MONA@@ PS , at 56 % of the patients had at least one undes@@ irable event ( AE ) on and at 78 % of these undes@@ irable events have been understood that they were not associated with AM@@ MONA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic response to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old rec@@ ital patient , which developed a met@@ abolic en@@ cephal@@ opath@@ y in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ to@@ sis , heavy hyp@@ ot@@ to@@ pen@@ ie , periph@@ ery N@@ europ@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred at a 5 month old to@@ d@@ dler with an acci@@ dentally single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed with intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day an dos@@ is@@ limit neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abolic active compound , which is caused by ac@@ et@@ y@@ ulation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ yl glut@@ amine , which will be eliminated via the kid@@ neys .
pus@@ chi@@ omet@@ ric is seen phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative bear@@ er for the elimination of surplus @-@ consuming nit@@ rogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ tic cycle may be assumed that for every gram it can be used so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0,12 and 0,15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is put at an early stage and the treatment will be started to improve the chances of survival and the clinical results .
the progno@@ sis of the earliest manifest@@ ed form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in the New Year was almost always inf@@ ects , and the disease conducted even in treatment with Per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their cup @-@ free an@@ alogue within the first year of life .
due to hem@@ or@@ aly@@ sis , the exploitation of altern@@ ate paths of nit@@ rogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( so@@ dium hydro@@ chlor@@ ic acid ) , prot@@ oc@@ um@@ ben@@ zo@@ at and so@@ dium hydro@@ chlor@@ ic acid , it was possible to diagnose the survival rates of post@@ sal@@ al at post@@ part@@ al ( however , within the first life cycle ) diagnosed in 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ op@@ ul@@ tural en@@ cephal@@ opath@@ y was the survival rate 100 % , but even with these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ man@@ ic form of the disease ( including feminine patients with het@@ ero@@ zy@@ got@@ hic form of Or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ ce @-@ deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ ammon@@ a@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ or@@ at and a prot@@ ein@@ decreased diet , the over@@ rate was 98 % .
existing neurological defic@@ its are also hardly re@@ versible and in some patients may occur another deteri@@ oration of the neurological state .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is ox@@ i@@ ously is ox@@ i@@ ded , which is in liver and kidney enz@@ atic , with glut@@ amine con@@ ju@@ ly , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine occurs .
the concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ abolic path@@ ia in Plas@@ ma and Ur@@ in were obtained by G@@ abe of a single dose of 5 g N@@ atri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis as well as repeated G@@ aben from oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ abolic disorders also has also been studied in cancer patients following intraven@@ ous form of so@@ dium yl@@ but@@ ary ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after a oral dose of 5 g N@@ atri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form , 15 minutes after the in@@ gest@@ able Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at have been established .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary medicines or hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ o@@ e@@ opath@@ ies after different doses phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning after n@@ igh@@ tly fas@@ c@@ ysts no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate can be ad@@ mitt@@ able in the pl@@ asma .
with three of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis that have been repeatedly treated with so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three individual doses ) , the moderate phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentration in the pl@@ asma seal on the third day five times higher than after the first gifts .
discharge The drug is dro@@ pping within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of con@@ ju@@ gi@@ fted product phen@@ yl@@ phosph@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kid@@ neys .
after the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests had N@@ atri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at with tox@@ icity and not toxic doses . ( investigation 24 and 48 h following or@@ aler administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children who cannot swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with slip problems ) or over a neuro@@ stom@@ ach@@ ment or a nas@@ al form .
according to previous clinical experience , normal daily dose @-@ dose is so@@ dium levels : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as income @-@ growing and adult .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um@@ proteins in pl@@ asma should be held within the normal area .
in patients who suffer from an early lack of car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate bladder or Or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ f , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or Arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0,@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per gram of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium bis@@ yl@@ but@@ ary that is equivalent to maximum daily dose .
when R@@ atten@@ f@@ ush have been exposed before the birth phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active Met@@ abo@@ lit of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , it was found for l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyr@@ ami@@ ds of the brain bar@@ k .
a prob@@ able toxic response to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old rec@@ ital patient , which developed a met@@ abolic en@@ cephal@@ opath@@ y in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ to@@ sis , heavy hyp@@ ot@@ to@@ pen@@ ie , periph@@ ery N@@ europ@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
pus@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative bear@@ er for the elimination of excess
based on research on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ yl glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ tic cycle , can be assumed that for every gram it can be used so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ or@@ at between 0,12 and 0,15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen .
existing neurological defic@@ its are also hardly re@@ versible , and in some patients may occur another deteri@@ oration of the neurological state .
after a or@@ alen single dose of 5 g N@@ atri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form were detected 15 minutes after the in@@ gest@@ able Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
during the duration of durability , the patient can keep the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C .
with this procedure , the small measuring spo@@ on ranges between 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spo@@ on 8,@@ 6 g N@@ atri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
if a patient has to obtain the medication above a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS can also be dis@@ solved in water ( the sol@@ v@@ ility of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at amounts to 5 g in 10 ml water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain Leb@@ ail@@ enz@@ ym@@ es are missing , so that they accum@@ ulate the sti@@ pul@@ ated waste products , which are accum@@ ulated after eating proteins in the body .
if you are exam@@ ining laboratory studies , you must notify the doctor that you take AM@@ MONA@@ PS , since so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can influence the results of certain laboratory studies .
in@@ gest@@ ing AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken when it is not prescription pharmac@@ euticals .
during the lact@@ ation period , you should not take AM@@ MONA@@ PS as the medicine could go on the breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , turbul@@ ent , head@@ aches , flav@@ ours , desc@@ ending of the ear , dism@@ iss@@ al , memory @-@ dys@@ functions and a deteri@@ oration of existing neurological conditions were observed .

An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ ms &quot; ( ACS , decreased blood flow to the heart ) , for example , by inst@@ abil@@ i Ang@@ ina ( a form of p@@ ains in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ nation ( heart attack ) ( an an@@ om@@ al measured value at the electro@@ cardi@@ ogra@@ m or E@@ KG ) .
is angi@@ el@@ ox in preventing blood cl@@ auses in patients who retreat one PCI , becomes a higher dosage administ@@ ered and the inf@@ usion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to the maintenance of blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI Express .
ann@@ ed 14 000 patients took part in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox with all@@ ot@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ IA inhibit@@ ors ( G@@ PI , a different medicine to prevent cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination @-@ treatment with Hep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI compared .
while PCI the patient has often been a st@@ ent ( a short tube ) used in the arter@@ ies to prevent a loading . and they also received other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ auses , such as de@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift of G@@ PI - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who under@@ went a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was just as effective as h@@ ep@@ arin , except for heavy ble@@ eding in which it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ arin .
An@@ gi@@ ox must not be applied in patients who may be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other sh@@ ud@@ ine or any of the other components .
it may not be used in patients who recently had a ble@@ eding , as well as with people with strong high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
the committee for human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) att@@ ained to the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI an ann@@ y@@ able replacement for Hep@@ it@@ is .
September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . approved for the transport of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
used for treating adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ ms ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / Non - ST @-@ Heb@@ ungs@@ infectious market ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) when an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initiation of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bol@@ us@@ ment of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0,25 mg / kg / h .
if there is a PCI result in the patient , an additional Bol@@ us should be given up of 0.5 mg / kg and inf@@ usion for the duration of the surgery on 1.75 mg / kg / h .
according to PCI requirements , the reduced inf@@ usion of 0,25 mg / kg / h can be added for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately prior to the surgery , a bol@@ us@@ ement of 0.5 mg / kg is administ@@ ered , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1,75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the Rhin@@ oplast@@ y .
the recommended dosage of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of a initial intraven@@ ous bol@@ us@@ ement of 0,75 mg / kg body weight and a lot of hierarchy with intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1,75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and effectiveness of a single bol@@ us form of an@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended , even if a short PCI operation is planned .
this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is short@@ ened under 225 seconds , should be a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight .
in order to reduce the appearance of low ACT values , the re@@ const@@ ituted and dil@@ uted medicines should be carefully mixed before the application and the Bol@@ us@@ sel@@ sis can be measured rapidly intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is no longer required , provided the 1,75 mg / kg inf@@ usion is administ@@ ered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney dys@@ functions ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which will be subjected to PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , should be used a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h .
is the ACT &apos;s value below 225 seconds , is a second Bol@@ us@@ p@@ sis of 0.3 mg / kg and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ p@@ sis is again to prove once again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , performed in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ Study ( RE@@ P@@ LACE @-@ 2 ) which led to approval , the ACT lay value 5 minutes by the property of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dos@@ is@@ Adjust@@ ment at an average 36@@ 6 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients the angi@@ el@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see under section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be introduced 30 minutes after ter@@ mination of the intraven@@ ous Hep@@ it@@ arian Hep@@ her or 8 hours after the completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gl@@ arin .
• famous hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity to the active ingredient or other components or against mil@@ iti@@ ine • active ble@@ eding or increased blood pressure . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ ver@@ able bacterial infection . • severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ tic patients
patients are to be monitored during the treatment carefully with regard to symptoms and signs of blood pressure , especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is administ@@ ered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in &apos;s most ble@@ eding occur at arter@@ ial indic@@ tai@@ on may occur in patients who under@@ go a per@@ k@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , during the treatment in principle of ble@@ eding ble@@ eding .
in patients who are treated war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a monitoring of the IN@@ R factory ( International Standards Rati@@ o ) should be considered to ensure that the value is att@@ ained to the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in to the treatment existing level .
depart@@ ing from the knowledge of the active mechanism of anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( Hep@@ it@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tika or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ag@@ greg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) can be understood that these agents increase the ble@@ eding .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolesc@@ ents and children over six years with diabetes that need treatment with ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall , the thig@@ h or the upper arm , or as a permanent inf@@ usion with a ins@@ ulin pump is administ@@ ered .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough ins@@ ulin into the regulation of gl@@ uc@@ ose pi@@ eg@@ els ( sugar@@ s ) in the blood or that ins@@ ulin may not be effective .
ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is very low @-@ tested by human@@ ins@@ ulin , and the change means that it has faster and a shorter activity has as a short @-@ effective human@@ ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a durable ins@@ ulin in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , where the body cannot produce ins@@ ulin , in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
with type @-@ 2 diabetes , where the body of ins@@ ulin is not effective , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the change of concentration of substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ ded hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how good the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study with adults with type @-@ 1 diabetes was a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in ins@@ ulin expi@@ res .
in adults with type @-@ 2 diabetes , the reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was in both six months after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0,30 % in human @-@ mal@@ ins .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against ins@@ ulin or any other components , or in patients who are already suffering from hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra must be customized if it is administ@@ ered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glu@@ cos@@ ities .
September 2004 the European Commission granted San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ enti@@ s Germany GmbH approval for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the whole European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdom@@ inal column , the upper chamber or the Del@@ t@@ am@@ us@@ eum or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous inf@@ usion in the area of the abdom@@ inal thickness .
due to the decreased Glu@@ kon@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the dimin@@ ished ins@@ ulin bar@@ ber , the ins@@ ulin is for patients with a limitation of live function .
any change of the substance , the stamp ( Her@@ - / - ) , the ins@@ ulin ( normal , N@@ PH , galvan@@ ised , etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can move a change in the ins@@ ulin form .
3 An inadequate dosage or the break@@ age of a treatment , particularly in patients with an ins@@ ulin gene , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a di@@ ab@@ etic ket@@ o@@ azi@@ sis ; these states are potentially life @-@ threatening .
changing a patient to another ins@@ ulin or ins@@ ulin by another manufacturer should take place under str@@ ingent medical supervision and can make a change of dosage required .
the time of occurrence of hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the substance profile of the used ins@@ ulin and can therefore change when changing the treatment chem@@ e .
among the substances , which can increase the ble@@ eding activity and increase the incl@@ ination to Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ias , oral anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic , fi@@ bro@@ ker@@ yl@@ lin , hydro@@ oxet@@ ine , mon@@ o@@ amine @-@ ox@@ ic@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) -@@ Hem@@ mer , Pro@@ po@@ xy@@ phen , S@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ates and Sul@@ fon@@ amid @-@ antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ etic , such as bet@@ s , cl@@ lon@@ id@@ ine , Guan@@ eth@@ id@@ in , and reser@@ pine the symptoms of no@@ rep@@ lic@@ ated counter @-@ regulation will be weak@@ ened or missing .
animal experimental studies on reproductive factors showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ ins@@ ulin in terms of pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether ins@@ ulin is over@@ thrown into the human mother &apos;s milk , but in general ins@@ ulin is neither in the mother &apos;s milk , nor will it res@@ or@@ ate after oral application .
following are the investig@@ ators listed from clinical trials , according to system organs and sorted according to decre@@ asing the frequency of their appearance ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency on the basis of ord@@ ba@@ it data in@@ estim@@ able ) .

heavy hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ bodies can be treated by a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ecting of gl@@ uc@@ ose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a trained person , or by intraven@@ ous gl@@ uc@@ ose by a doctor .
according to a glu@@ ing object , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to identify the Ur@@ - thing for heavy hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
ins@@ ulin shi@@ fts the blood sugar levels by stim@@ ulating the periph@@ eral gl@@ uc@@ ose ( especially through sk@@ elet@@ al muscles and fat ) as well as by the in@@ hibition of gl@@ uc@@ ose @-@ production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that sub@@ cut@@ aneous gau@@ ges of ins@@ ulin types occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em Nor@@ mal@@ ins@@ ulin .
in a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 @-@ Diabetes mel@@ li@@ - T@@ us showed ins@@ ulin measuring range from 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0,15 m / kg a dispro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ ant effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a sub@@ propor@@ tion@@ ate increase of glu@@ cos@@ ity effect , just like human@@ ins@@ ulin .
ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast as fast as normal human@@ ins@@ ulin and achiev@@ es the complete glu@@ cos@@ ity effect effect about 2 hours earlier than Human@@ ins@@ ulin .
the data has been seen that in an application of ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved as with human@@ ic Nor@@ mal@@ ins@@ ulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal was pressed , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ ate control was given as having human@@ ic Nor@@ mal@@ ins@@ ulin , which has been given 2 minutes before the meal .
the ins@@ ulin use is applied for 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control is given as with human normal Nor@@ mal@@ ins@@ ulin , which is given 2 m@@ esh in front of the meal ( see picture 1 ) .
ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at G@@ abe 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ LI@@ S@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal was given in comparison to human normal Nor@@ mal@@ ins , the 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1@@ A ) and compared to human normal Nor@@ mal@@ ins , the 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) was given before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) .
