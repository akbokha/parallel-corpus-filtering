<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European public administration report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Humantherapeutic agents (CHMP) has assessed the studies conducted on recommendations regarding the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information on your illness or their treatment, please refer to the package unit (also component of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or a pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">For more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as solution to income (7.5 mg / ml) and as an injection resolution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wiring thinking and speakers, hallucinations (hearing or sight of things, which are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar disorder, a psychological disorder, in which patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal upset) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate-heavier manic episodes and to prevention of manic episodes in patients who have addressed in the past to the drug.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injecting solution is applied for quick control of irritated unrest or behavioural dysfunction if the oral intake of the medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution to the one or the melt-coated tablets are used in patients who are preparing the gorges of tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking besides other medicines that are just as abilify, the dose of abilify should be adapted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This affects the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells among each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably appears especially as a "partial Agonist" for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazol such as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters appear to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Da Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, eliminating psychotic or manic symptoms and their reoccur will be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">Abilify the effectiveness of probabilify, the reoccur of symptoms, was examined in three trials over to a year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of injecting solution has been compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases resulting in matured unrest over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, abilify over twelve weeks at 347 patients with haloperidol, in a different study the efficacy of abilify and placebo that reoccur to 160 patients in which the some symptoms were already stabilised by abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of abilify injecting solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered in gestated unrest, compared with the Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies the change in symptoms of patients by a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to treatment examined.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies in order to investigate how the body uses the melting-coated tablets and the solution to repairing.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two studies with the injecting location, patients who received probfy in doses of 5,25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, a significant stronger reduction in symptoms gested unrest than patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In applying for the treatment of bipolar disorder, abilify in four of the five short-term studies have more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also has more effective than placebo for up to 74 weeks as placebo the reoccur manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was additionally administered to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses are also more effective than placebo the symptoms inferired unrest and were similar effectively as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side-effects of abilify for income (observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidale interference (unneckless), locking, nautical secretion (increased saliva), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleeability) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The committee for human therapeutic agents (CHMP) worked at the conclusion that the advantages of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mostly manic episodes, and in which the manic episodes aimed at treatment with Aripiprazol, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injecting unrest and behavioural dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar disorder, if a oral therapy is not suitable to overbalance the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004 the European Commission granted the Group of Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for the transport of abilify in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is for the treatment of moderate to heavy manic episodes in the bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients displayed, the mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes aimed at treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended dose of probabilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a focal dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of the meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended initial dose for abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of the meals as a monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients over 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">Having regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group should be considered a lower initialdosis should be considered when clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4-Indutor is dismissed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The appearance of suicide-social behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after switching to a anti-psychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder no increased suicide risiko with Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotic medicines.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be applied with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular Diseases, galvanizing disorders, hypoetic disease, hypovolaemia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with bleeding drugs) or hypertension (including acczelerated and maligned form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, which was a year or less digested, there were occasional stories about during the treatment with Aripiprazol spinal Dyskinesia.</seg>
<seg id="39">If treated with probabilify patients there are signs and symptoms of a spontaneity, should be considered to reduce the dose or disrupt the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient emerged signs and symptoms that indicate a mns, or unclear high fever, without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotic medicines, including abilify.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazol should be used in patients with cramply cases in anamnese or in states that are related with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazol associated with patients with psychoses which were associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazol, a heightened sterberisiko compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosing, a significant relationship between the dosage and the talking for unwanted cerebral events associated with Aripiprazol actually treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycaemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoazielen or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was treated in patients suffering with atypical antipsychotic agents, including abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycaemia-related events with abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents to be treated directly.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsie, Polyurie, Polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should regularly be observed in terms of deterioration of glucose values.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally seen in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar manic, the use of antipsychotic medicines, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazol to the Central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazol is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with contenched side effects such as seduction. (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-Antagonist Famotidin, a Magensäure-blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazol, however this effect does not be relevant as clinically.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy proxy boosted a high-effective CYP2D6-Inhibitor (Chinidin) the AUC from Aripiprazol by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other high effective inhibitors from CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects have and therefore should be made similar dosage reduction.</seg>
<seg id="52">At CYP2D6 'poor' (= "poor") metabolic disorder, the joint application with high-effective inhibitors from CYP3A4 in higher Plasmakonzentrations by Aripiprazol result in comparison to CYP2D6 extensive Metabolisers.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common hub of ketoconazole or other high-effective CYP3A4 inhibitors to abilify the potential benefits should be the potential risks to patients.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other high-effective inhibitors from CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV-Proteininhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose reduction.</seg>
<seg id="55">After distributing the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitors should be the dosage of abilify on the dose height before beginning to commence therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 along with abilify can be administered with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials the doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazol per day no significant effect on the metabolic disorders of the substrate of CYP2D6 (Dextromethoran / 3-methodology), 2C9 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethmorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify her doctor if they are pregnant or a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data base for the safety when humans and due to the difficulties inherent in the animal studies, this medicine should not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits are clearly the potential risk to the foetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, however in other antipsychotic medicines, patients should be warned of dangerous machines, including power vehicles, to use until they are certain that Aripiprazol have no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects occurred more frequent (Ephesians 1 / 100) than under placebo or were classified as possible medical-effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The incidence of the listed side effects is defined following the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study for 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Aripianicism, Akathisie, Dystonie and Dyskinetic compared to patients who were treated with semoperidol (57,3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled study for 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19% was in patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled term study for 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14,8% was treated with patients who were treated with Aripiprazol, and 15.1% in patients under the age of Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar disorder - In a controlled trial for 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23.5% was in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53,3% for patients under semoperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study for 12 weeks the incidence of EPS was 6% in patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">During the long time planning phase over 26 weeks during a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18,2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated placebo patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters, revealed no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Booster of CPK (creatine-phosphate kinase), generally temporarily and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol to patients compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo untreated patients.</seg>
<seg id="71">Among the side effects which may occur in connection with an anti-psychotic therapy, the maligne neuroleptal syndrome, spicdyskinesia and scrapprism, unwanted events and increased mortality with older dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch were unintentional or abducted outdosiations with Aripiprazol alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death succession.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the effectiveness of a heralysis in treating an overdose with Aripianol. however, it is unlikely that hemoralysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose of benefits, as Aripiprazol has a high plasma operation.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripiprazol with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder on the combination of a partial agonistic effect on Dopamine D2- and Serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors will be conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol showed in vitro a high affinity for Dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and to serotonin 5HT1- and 5HT2a receptor and 5HT7-, to alpha-1 norepingen and to histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In Gabe by Aripiprazol in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks of healthy subjects showed a dosisdependent reduction in ties of 11C-racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligne, at the nucleus caudatus and at the coup.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled spa studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenen patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Aripiprazol compared to placebo a statistically significant improvement of the psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a Haloperidol-controlled trial in week 52 the share of respondents patients who kept a talk on the study training, in both groups similar to Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measles, which were defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asmine-scale, showed a significant stronger improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia showed an significantly higher reduction in the back rate that was at 34% in the Aripiprazol group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In a Olanzapin-controlled, multinational double blind study at schizophrenia (N = 18 or 13% of valuable patients infected) with significant less patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the output value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage for 3 weeks with patient with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazol showed an over placebo-superior effectiveness in reducing symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed doses of the bipolar-I-disorder showed Aripiprazol compared to placebo no superior effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed background, Aripiprazol showed an over placebo-superior effectiveness in week 3 and a durable effect that was comparable to that of lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazol also reported a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of the manie on such as lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled trial on 6 weeks of patients with a manic or mixed episode, with or without psychotic characteristics which partly reflect over 2 weeks not on Lithium- or Valproat-Monotherapy in the reduction of manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks, followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved a remission with Aripiprazol against placebo in terms of prevention of bipolar back, predominantly in prevention of a return to the Manie.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on vitro-studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 is responsible for stretching and hydroxylabeling of Aripiprazol, the N-DealkyTION is catalyzed through CYP3A4 catalytic.</seg>
<seg id="89">The middle of Eliminationshalbwertszeit lies at approximate 75 hours for Aripiprazol over CYP2D6 and at approximate 146 hours at 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolic work via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">At Aripiprazol, there are no differences in the Pharmakocinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as a pharmacological investigation of schizophrenia patients showed no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A non-specific analysis of the pharmaceutical ininetics yielded no indication of clinically significant differences in ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the phmakokinetics of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacological properties of Aripiprazol and hydro-Aripiprazol have been similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy subjects.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study with Probanden with disagreements of the Lebailinetics (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver artistry machine, but the study comprised only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not enough to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety spdiology, toxicity at repeatable quality, reproduction, genotoxicity and for canogenous potential the preclinical data cannot realize specific hazards to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or positions which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>

<seg id="302">Pacataxel is an antilever ingredient which promotes the consolidation of microtubules from the Tubular indians and stabilizes the microtubules by inhibition of their deportation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to a inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network that is essential for the vital interest-phase and the otic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albuminto the Transzytose of PlasmaComponents conveys on the endothelical components and in the context of in-vitro studies has been proven that the presence of Albumin is promoted by the finish of the paclitaxel through the endothelm cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is thought that this improved transendotheliale transportation is conveyed by the gp-60-album receptor and due to the albuminbinds Proteins (indited alleracidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation in the field of tumors.</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic Mammakarzinom is supported by 106 patients in two monarmied unrelated studies and by 454 patients who were treated in a randomised phase III comparative study.</seg>

<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type-2 diabetes (also known as not insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be applied solely (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight individuals) in which metformin (a diabetesmedikament) is not displayed. • It can be applied together with another Diabetesmedikament (Dualtherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can additionally be applied to metformin in patients (in particular superior patients) which cannot be satisfactorily adjusted in the highest tolerated dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphyl epoxide or insulin, the previous dosage can be maintained with the beginning of the Actos treatment, except for patients with hypoglycaemia (lower blood sugar); here the dosage should be reduced to the sulphyl of the insulin or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be improved considerably, and the blood sugar level decreases, which allows type-2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of accounts in tripley were examined; the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphyl fuel, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylided Hämoglobin, HbA1c) measured that indicates how well the blood sugar has been adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to lowering the HbA1c-value, which allows the blood sugar levels in applying the doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripley study the effect of the additional gift from Actos to existing treatment with metformin and a sulphyl values by 0,94% while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of accounts and insulin has been examined in 289 patients reported a reduction of the hbA1c values of 0,69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients suffering from additional placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects related to Actos were visual dysfunctions, infections of the upper respiratory tract (colds), weight gain and hypoanaesthesia (reduced sensitivity to irritation).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) towards Pioglitazon or one of the other components, even in patients with liver issues, heart failure or diabetetic ketoazisis (high ketones - mammals) in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos is to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not shown.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin or incompatibility with insulin types or intolerance. (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For use of Pioglitazon for patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients affected by the presence at least one risk factor (i.e. former coronary heart attack or symptomatic coronary artery disease), the doctor should begin the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a congestive heart failure, weight gain or oils, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a congestive heart failure, gaining weight and oils, when Pioglitazon is applied in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A Cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazon in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing progressive pharmaceutic disorder has been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports of congestive heart failure, which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with an increased intake of liver enzymphenymes (ALT &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the standard area) or with other signs of liver disease may not be used Pioglitazone.</seg>

<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient will be continued with Pioglitazon, up to the prescribing of the laboratory parameters of the clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with Pioglitazon has been proven a dosisdependent weight gain, which can be frosted by fatty deposits, and in some cases associated with a fluid treatment.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hereslution, under the therapy with Pioglitazon, a diminished reduction of the middle hemp-values (relative reduction by 4%) and the hematocrits (relative reduction by 4,1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes have been observed in comparative controlled studies with Pioglitazon in patients under metformin (relative reduction of the hemostentine around 3-4%) and to a lesser extent also in patients under Sulfonyl, and insulin (relative reduction of the hemostentine by 1-2%) and hematocrits around 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of the increased insulin-sensitivity consists of patients, the Pioglitazon as oral or three-fold combined therapy with a sulphyl or three-cell therapy with insulin, the risk of dosisdependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the launch of the market was reported under the treatment with Thiazolidindions, including Pioglitazon, about an appearance or a deterioration of a diabetic maculaödems with a reduction in the visual sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pioglitazon and the appearance of maculaödems if patients report about disturbances of the visual sharpness; a suitable ophthalmological waste should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of announcements from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon</seg>
<seg id="782">The exterminated fracture amounted to 1.9 trilograms per 100 patient years with Pioglitazon treated women and 1.1 factions per 100 patient years with women who were treated with a comparative disease.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the proactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular problems occurred in 44 / 870 (5,1%; 1.0 Fraktures per 100 patient-years) who were treated with Pioglitazon patients compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 Fractures per 100 patient-years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medicine.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is deducted (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the investigation of the interactions have shown that Pioglitazon does not have relevant effects on the pharmakokinetics or pharmakodynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with pharmaceuticals, who are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptive, cyclosporin, calcium-blocker and HMGCoA-Reduktasformer are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a Cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase in AUC by Pioglitazon around the 3-fold.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8-Indutor) resulted in a reduction in AUC by Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that in treatment with Pioglitazon the hyperinsulin is reduced in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance, thus reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for the federal growth.</seg>

<seg id="796">In the over a period of 3.5 years ongoing proactive study, Frakturen in 44 / 870 (5,1%) of patients were treated with Pioglitazon patients compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparative medicine.</seg>
<seg id="797">While taking the reported maximum of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to have an activation of specific key receptors (peroxisome Proliferator Activated Recepor-g (PPAR-g)), which leads to an increased insulin-sensitivity of liver, obesity and skeleton muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose rating in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical trial with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazide as monotherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time up to repayment of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c by 8.0% after the first 6 treatments).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy, a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) by Pioglitazon at 69% of the patients to be treated (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclaw).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebokee study for 12 months, patients whose blood sugar has been randomised in insufficient optimisation phase with insulin, to pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon reduced the middle HbA1c - value of 0,45%, compared to the patients who continues to receive only insulin; a reduction in insulin delivery in the group treated with Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, under Pioglitazon showed a statistically significant reduction in the Albumin / Kreatinin-Quotienten compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, limited to 18 weeks of examination by type-2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma triglyzeride and the free fatty acids and a rise of HDL- cholesterol levels as well as minor, however clinically no significant increased LDL cholesterol levels observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years reduced Pioglitazon compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclazid the total classign glyzeride and the open fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo was not observed statistically significant increase in the LDL cholesterol levels, while under metformin and Gliclazide decreased values observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study over 20 weeks reduced Pioglitazon not only the sober-triglyceride level, but also improved the postprandial elevated Triglyceride level, this both about an effect on the triglyzerid absorption as well as the hepatic triglypherid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the proactive study, a cardiac Outcome study, 5238 patients were randomised with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing progressive macrovascular disease in groups, which received over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiac therapy either Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">According to oraler application, Pioglitazon is rapidly resorated, whereby the top concentrations of invariable pioglitazon at plasma will usually be reached 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution from M-IV to efficacy in approximately the triple the effectiveness of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II minimal is pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interactivity studies could be proven that Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on the pharmakocinetics or pharmakodynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a Cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8-Induktor) or lowers the Plasmakonzentration of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">According to oraler application of radioactive market Pioglitazon with humans, the marker was mainly found in the waste (55%) and to a lesser extent in Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The middle plasma-Eliminationshalbwertszeit of unaltered pioglitazon amounts to people 5-6 hours, and those of the entire active Metabolites is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma-centrations of Pioglitazon and its metabolic disorders are lower than in patients with reduced kidney function, although the fry of the oral Clearance of the mother substanz can resemble.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies conducted in mice, rats, dogs and ape subanimously after repeatable Plasmavolume magnifying with hereslution, anemia and stimulating excentric cardiac disease.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazon the hyperinsulin is reduced in the form of hyperinsulin and increased insulin resistance, thus reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for the federal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) were induced in the rat-higher incidence of hyperplasia (with male and female rats) and tumors (with male rats) of the urinary epithelium.</seg>

<seg id="824">In the proactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular problems occurred in 44 / 870 (5,1%; 1.0 Fraktures per 100 patient-years) who were treated with Pioglitazon patients compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 Fractures per 100 patient-years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medicine.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with Pioglitazon or Gliclazide were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, under Pioglitazon showed a statistically significant decrease in the Albumin / Kreatinin-Quotienten compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study over 20 weeks reduced Pioglitazon not only the sober-triglyceride level, but improved in addition the postprandial elevated Triglyceride level, this has an effect on the Tryglyzerid absorption as well as to the hepatic tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Though the study was missing the target regarding its primary end-point, which is a combination of the total mortality, non-deadly, coronary syndrome, subamputation above the ankle, corresponding to the Borrelia ascularization and Revascularization of the leg arteries, place the results that are connected with the intake of Pioglitazon does not have cardiovascular disease risks.</seg>

<seg id="865">The study was measured after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance (glycosylided hemmoglobin (HbA1c) which indicates how well the blood sugar has been adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease of the HbA1c-Spider, which pointed out that the blood sugar levels were similar to a different human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to humaninsulin (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, the doses of Actraphan may need to be adapted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar (the complete list is the pack of pack).</seg>
<seg id="869">The committee for human therapeutic agents (CHMP) attained to the conclusion that the advantages of Actraphane in the treatment of diabetes compared to the risks of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">October 2002, the European Commission granted Novo Nordisk A / S approval for the transport of Actraphane across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily when a quick initial effect is desired with a longer continuing effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injecting nadel must be loaded at least 6 seconds under the skin to ensure that the entire dose was injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar is significantly improved, for example, by a increased insulin therapy, the hypoglycaemia symptoms can be altered and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change in terms of strength, brand (manufacturers), insulin (fast acting, biogenic, long acting insulin, etc.), Art of insulin (animal insulin, humaninsulin or insulin) and / or manufacturing method (by recombinant DNA towards insulin or insulin) can cause a change in the dosage is required.</seg>
<seg id="875">If the transition to Actraphane is required in the patient a dosage adjustment is necessary, it may be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after switching.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients in which hypoglycemic reactions after a shift from animal for human insulin occurred, reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypoglycaemia was less pronounced or unlike in their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Prior to travel, which should go over several time zones, the patient should be advised to obtain the Council of his physician since such trips can lead to that insulin and meals must be applied at other times or must be taken.</seg>

<seg id="879">4 Both hypoglycaemia as well as hyperglycaemia, which can occur in a non-controlled diabetic therapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fertility in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Heavy hypoglycaembodies can lead to awareness and / or scramply waste, and with temporary or permanent disturbances of the brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Disorders of nervous system Gelegia - Peripheral Neuropathy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control may be associated with complaints that are referred to as acute neuropathy and usually reversible.</seg>
<seg id="882">5 A intensification of insulin gene therapy with a ruptive improvement of blood sugar adjustment can however be associated with a temporary deterioration of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>

<seg id="886">However, a hypoglycaemia can develop gradually: • Expiled hypoglycaembodies can be treated by the oral import of glucose or sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always be funglade, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice in each case. • Schwere hypoglycaemias are treated with a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1,0 mg) by a proven aid person or is given by a doctor of glucose which is intravenous by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect starts within half an hour, the real estate is achieved within 2 to 8 hours and the total capacity is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The Resorption profile is founded in it, that it is a mixture of insulin products with fast or consumed Resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of transforms (Hydrolyse-) places on the human insulin molecule were taken into consideration; none of the metabolic metabolic disorders is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on conventional studies on safety spdiology, toxicity at repeatable quality, genotoxicity, for carcinogenous potential and reproduction, the preclinical data do not identify specific dangers to humans.</seg>

<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions, which can lead to a reduction of the tacroliMuslim levels in the blood and a toning of the clinical effect of tacrolim, the intake of herbal supplements (hypericum perforatum) contain, or other plant-fradine as a treatment with Advagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful surveillance of tacrolimus- concentrations provided in the blood since the tacrolim blood levels can be subjected to considerable fluctuations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, under Prograf one was referred to as Kardiomyopathy and observed hypertrophia, which can therefore also occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Further factors that increase the risk of such clinically disorders are an already existing heart suffering, treatment with cortious anxiety, hypertension, kidney or liver dysfunctions, infections, fluid-load and oils.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppresssiva, the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted for the possible risk of malignant skin change by suitable clothing or using a parasitic factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who occupy Tacrolimus, Symptoms for PRES such as headaches, altered consciousness of consciousness, cramps and tendons should show a radiological investigation (e.g.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies which are known as inhibitor or inductors of CYP3A4, can affect the metabolism of tacrolim and thus increase the bloodstream of tacrolim.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It therefore recommends to monitor the tacrolimuscle tissue in comparison of chemical substances that can alter the CYP3A metabolism, and to set the tacrolim dose to maintain moderate concentrations respectively (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly distinctive fixation was carried out with antimykica such as ketoconazole, Fluconazole, Itraconazole and Voriconazole, as well as with the Macrolid antibiotic Sythromycin and HIV protector release (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmaceutical therapy affects the increase of blood levels primarily from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolim, due to the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">High-based prednisolon or methylprednisolon as it is used in acute symptoms, the concentration of tacrolim can increase or decrease in blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Effect of tacrolim on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4-Hemmer; therefore the simultaneous application of tacrolim with medicines that will affect through CYP3A4 metabolized, whose metabolism is compromised.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since Tacrolim the Clearance of steroid contrasts put up and thus increase the hormone position, is particularly careful in decisions about receptive policies.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animals have shown that tacrolim can decrease Clearance of Pentobarbital and phenazon and extend their half-time.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of investigations on transplant patients deliver no indication that under Tacrolim compared to other immunosuppressants a heightened risk of unwanted events with regard to the course and the result of pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="1467">It was reported on benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV- Associated lymphoproliferative disorders and skin-related disorders related to the treatment with Tacrolim.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low solubility and high conditionality of erythrocytes and plmapmapone can be assumed that tacrolim is not dialysible.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Activity mechanism and pharmacological-dynamics. at the molecular level, the effects of Tacrolimus can be taught by its bond to a zytosolish protein (FKBP12) which is responsible for enrichment of the connection in the cell nucleus.</seg>

<seg id="1655">Aeropze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (pitfalls, caused by an allergy against pollen, inflammation of the nose-way) in patients with nasal gland (petrifter nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents from 12 years the recommended dose of aeryze is twice daily with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended once the symptoms, above all the swelling of the nose-sloping nose (hidden nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended, because the effects of the drug can be diminished to the constipation of your nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effective dimensions were the changes of the sword-wheel of the hystamp-symptoms which were reported by the patients before the start of treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study the patients carried out their symptoms all 12 hours into a diary with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms have been in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all the hay of hay symptoms, besides the constipation of the nose reported the patients suffering from the symptoms around 46,0%, compared to 35,9% in the patient, the Pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nose-slum has been viewed, patients under Aerinaze showed a alleviation of symptoms around 37,4% compared to 26,7% in patients who captured desloratadine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are Tachykardie (heartbeat), oral disease, dizziness, psychothasis, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), Somnolenz (keys), insular disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aeryze is allowed to treat patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, Pseudoephedrine or one of the other components, against replicing agents or loratadine (another medicine for the treatment of allergies) are not applied.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a Engage glaucoma (raised eye pressure), cardiac disease or vascular diseases (hypertension), hyperthyrosive (hyperfunction of the thyroid) or have had a risk of hemorrhoea (caused by a brain bleeding) or have a risk for a hagrhrhagic stroke.</seg>

<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however, is to swallow in the whole (i.e. without shattered, break or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze was supposed to be applied because of the lack of data for objectionable and effectiveness (see section 5.1) not to be applied in children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after ending the symptoms.</seg>

<seg id="1911">Agenerase has been studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, investigates two main studies with 736 HIV infected adults, which had previously not been dealt with the release numbers.</seg>
<seg id="1912">That with low dosified Ritonavir increased medicinal plant in Agenerase was compared with 206 adults, which had been taken before the release of the release, with other proteins numbers.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-proven concentrations of HIV in the blood (Viruslast) or the amendment of the Viruslast after the treatment.</seg>

<seg id="1970">A dosing rate for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, there is however a machine-machine vision, since the effectiveness and inconceivable of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There is no pharmacological study carried out in combination with didanosin combination with Didanosin, but due to the antacid component of Didanosin recommended that revenues from Didanosin and Agenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, the property of Efavir is required in combination with Amfreavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no tin-adaption necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavideo in combination with Amprenavir and Saquinavir is not recommended as the exposition of both proteins are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other proteins and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapin may possibly senate the serumkonzentration of Amiga.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these medicines should be used at the same time, caution is offered because Delavirdin is less effective because of the decreased or possibly subtherapeutic Plasmaspiegel less effective.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When these medicines will be applied together, caution is offered; a thorough clinical and virological control should be performed because an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of combustavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous property of Amprenavir and Rifabutin led to a rise in Plasmakonzentration (AUC) by Rifabutin by 193%, and thus a rise of the side-related side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is required for clinical reasons, rifabutin ing along with Agenerase is administered to a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data are available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmaceutical ininetic studies with Agenerase in combination with erythromycin were not conducted but could be the plasma seal of both drugs in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of fossil fuel with 200 mg of ketoconazole once daily resulted in an increase in the Cmax of ketoconazole at plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-star) to the 2,69fold in comparison with the value that was observed after 200 mg ketoconazole once daily without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inmer or inductors of CYP3A4, can be applied together with a generase, potentially lead to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be applied to toxic reactions that are associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other proteins, it is advisable that antazida should not be taken at the same time as a generase as it may come to resorphosis.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anti-vulsiva, which are known as enzymphentors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, Carbamazepin), with amputavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma seal of amber.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentrations of calcium-blockers such as Amlodipin, diltiazem, rim, Isradipin, nimdipin, ninsdipin, nisoldipin, and Verapamil can be increased 10 by Amprenavir, thus reducing the activity and toxicity of this drug.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous intake with Agenerase can increase substantial harm and increase using PDE5 inhibitors in related effects including hypotension, visual dysfunctions and Priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous property of Agenerase is not recommended with oonavir along with these glukokortikoids, unless that the potential benefits of a treatment overweighs the risk of systemic corial cortical-effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">At HMG-Coa-refrase inhibitor such as Lovastatin and simvastatin, whose interchangement is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are distinctive to expect crease of plasma seal during temporary delivery.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since Plasmassmegelgle at this HMG-CoA-Reduktase inhibitor to myopathy, including a rhubdomyolysis, the combined application of these medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It is recommended a common monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations until the stabilization of the mirror, as the plasma-concentration of cyclosporin, Rapamycin and tacrolim can be increased by an equal gift from Amprenavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase may not be applied along with orally hinted Midazolam (see Section 4.3) while with equal use of Agenerase with parenteral Midazolam caution.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral Midazolam with other protocular inhibitors point to a possible rise of plasma prints from Midazolam to adjust the 3- to 4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadone is administered together with amusavir, patients should therefore be monitored on oral disease symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of Ritonavir administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the motif low reliability of historical comparisons can currently no recommendation be given like the Ampreneurr- dose is customizable if amusavir is administered at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous genes of warfarin or other oralen anticoagulants along with Agenerase, an enhanced control of the INR (International normonic Ratio) is recommended for the possibility of toning or reinforcement of the anti-throotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration by Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptive is not predictable, therefore alternative methods are recommended for contraception.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side-effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example 'Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended when simultaneous gift of Agenerase (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2177">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete storage division of the treated warts. • Aldara was also examined in 724 patients with small bass cell carcinoma in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and aldara or the placebo either daily or five times a week.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with complete storage division of tumors after 12 weeks. • Aldara was also tested in two studies in total 505 patients with acute hoatrates.</seg>
<seg id="2179">In all studies Aldara was more effective than placebo. • For the treatment of warts in the genital area, the complete final rate of patients were treated with placebo untreated patients. • The results of the two studies involving placebo untreated patients showed a full treatable rate of 66% to 80% in patients compared to 0% to 3% in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="2180">The most common side effects of Aldara (observed with more than 1 of 10 patients) are reactions to the application of the cream (pain or itch).</seg>

<seg id="2184">A break in the above treatment procedures should be weighed when intensive local anti-inflammatory reactions occur (see section 4.4) or when the treatment range is observed in the treatment range.</seg>
<seg id="2185">If the follow-up investigation of 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period, lesions is only incomplete, a different therapy should be started (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2186">If a dose was dropped, the patient will carry the cream, once he / she had noticed this and then proceed with the usual therapeutic plan.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Imiquimod creature is applied in a thin sliding and in the spotted, bursting with feigwarts induced skin area until the cream is fully reared.</seg>
<seg id="2188">In these patients there should be a gradation between the benefit of treatment with imiquimod and the risk associated with a potential worsening of their autoimmune diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2189">The risk associated with these patients should be conducted between the benefits of treatment using Imiquimod and the risk of organabstaining or graft-versus-host- reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2190">In other studies in which no daily allegations were conducted, two cases of severe phimosis, and a case with one to circumcision has been observed.</seg>
<seg id="2191">With an application of Imiquimod-cream in higher than the recommended doses, there is increased risk to severe local skin irritation (see Section 4.2.) In rare cases were also observed among factemperer application of severe local skin irritation, which made treatment required and / or to have led to a temporary physical impairment.</seg>
<seg id="2192">In cases where such reactions occur at the output of the urethra, some women had difficulties in the water, which needed a catheterisation and treatment of affected area.</seg>

<seg id="2204">The available data on the metinent keratose on the forearms and the hands do not support the effectiveness in this field of application, so this application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local Hauchers often appear on, but these reactions usually take back in the course of therapy to intensity, or go after decomposing the therapy with imiquimod credentials.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local main actions of the patient cause big discomfort or are very strong, the treatment may be exposed to some days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">From the data of an open clinical study, patients with more than 8 AK- lesions are reduced to less complete healing rate than patients with fewer than 8 lambs.</seg>

<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Alojamala can be increased by the additional gift of a Corticosteroids (a drug which can be applied as antiemology).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use of patients under 18 years of age is not recommended, because of the effects in this age group is not enough information available.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the ingredient of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), prevents the receptors in the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was examined in three main studies on 1 842 adults, which received chemical physiotherapists, which are strong or moderate dissolvers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting are revealed 59% of patients who were treated with aloxi, in the 24 hours following chemotherapy (132 from 223), compared with 57% of the patients to untreated patients (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">Chemical otherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting are examined 81% of patients who were treated with aloxi, in the 24 hours following chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of the patients treated with Ondansetron to patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">With a comparison with Dolcetron these values are at 63% for Alojamx (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolcetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">March 2005, the European Commission granted the Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. approval for the transport of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indices: to the prevention of acute sickness and vomiting at heavily emetogens chemotherapy due to cancer disease and to the prevention of nausea and vomiting in ly emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer disease.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of aloxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induces by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy can be reinforced by adding any prior chemotherapy Corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Because Palonosetron can prolong the colon prosy, patients should be monitored with an amnestan obstipation or sign of a subaki Ileus after the injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is offered with simultaneous genes by Palonosetron with drugs that extend the QT interval or in patients with which Qt- interval is extended or the lead to such prolongation.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Except in connection with a further chemical physiotherapies, Aloxi should neither be used in the days after chemotherapy nor to prevention nor treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>

<seg id="2623">In a clinical study showed no significant pharmacological mental effect between a unique intravenous dosage Palonosetron and a steelady concentration of metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a based on a population of based pharmacological analysis was shown that the simultaneous property of CYP2D6-Industrine (Amiodaron, Celecoxib, fluoxetine, haloperidol, servonavir, Sertraline and Terbinafin) had no significant impact on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences regarding the use of Palonosetron in human pregnancies are not available, so Palonosetron should not be applied at pregnant women, unless it is necessary from the treatable doctor as necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 mcg. observed side effects (total 633 patients) who were at least possibly associated with Alojamala related, headaches (9%) and Obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of oversensitivity and reactions to the administration city (burning, curing, discomfort and pain) were indicated in post-marketing experience.</seg>

<seg id="2632">Studies of studies with ly emetogens chemotherapy and the study with strong emetogens chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies for indication chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) were the effects of Palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and EKG parameters including the QTc intervalls with the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolcetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the findings of pre-clinically investigations, Palonosetron has the ability to block the Ionary channels and repolarization involved in the ventricular channels and lengthen the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out by 221 healthy Probanden study was the assessment of the EKG-effects of I.v. administered Palonosetron in individual doses of 0,25, 0,75 and 2,25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous Gabe follows an initial decrease of the plasma-centrations a slow elimination of the body with an average-time half-time period of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum Plasmakonzentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally associated in the entire dose area of 0,3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to intravenous demand of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, at 11 Hodenkarzinompatienten rendering between day 1 and day 5 (± SD) increase in the Palonosetron-Plasmakonzentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacmakocrinetic simulations emerged, that the current intravenous form of 0.25 mg Palonosetron has reached three consecutive days (AUC0- ∞) with which according to non-recurring figure was comparable; however, the Cmax is higher after the addition of 0,75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% will be eliminated over the kidneys, and some 50% will be converted into two primary metabolic pathologic compared to Palonosetron over less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for metabolic studies have shown that CYP2D6 and, in lesser extent, the Isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 on the Metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were refound approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as unchangeable substance made about 40% of the given dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous bolts for healthy was the overall physical clearance 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renale Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">While patients with severe liver tumor, the terminale Eliminationshlands increases and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron increases, however, a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In clinical trials, effects were observed only after extrusion, which are regarded as adequate above the maximum humanistic exposure, which indicates a small relevance to clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 From clinical trials are evidence that Palonosetron can only block into very high concentration of congregations, which can prohibit the ventricular DE- and repolarization and may extend the action of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (every dose corresponded to about the total of the therapeutic exposure to humans) which have been given daily over two years, resulted in an increased incidence of liver circline (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, creepenenmark), and Hauttumae with rats, but not with mice.</seg>

<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to 15 years, the compatibility of Ambirix was compared with the 3-cans of combination.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and kindness based on a calculation basis per vaccdosis Ambirix, but not based on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 50,7% of the subjects compared with 39.1% in the subjects following the approval of a dose of the 3-cans of combination.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination reported 66.4% of the subjects, which had gotten Ambirix over pain, over 63,8% in the subjects that have been vaccinated with the 3-tin-process combinationent.</seg>
<seg id="2756">The frequency of Matousness was however comparable in size (i.e. over the whole vaccination with 39.6% of the subjects that have received ambirix, compared to 36.2% in the subjects that received the 3-boxes similar to the subjects).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of prevalence pain and matininess was low and comparable to, which was observed according to administration of the combination-vaccine with the 3-doses vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study at 1- to 11-year vaccinations, the appearance of localization actions and general interactions in the Ambirixgroup was comparable to that which was observed with administration with the 3-split-combinationary with 360 ELISA-units formalinized hepatitis A-A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B-surface area.</seg>
<seg id="2759">At the 6- to 11- year-old, however, after vaccination with Ambirix, a common occurrence of pain (at the injections) per dose, not per Proband, reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines, which are reported via serious side-effects during the 2-doses vaccinations with 360 ELISA- units formalininactivated hepatitis A-A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis A, was statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials, which were conducted at vaccinations at the age of 1 to 15 years, the sero-conquestrian rates for anti-HAV 99,1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month 6 administered dosage (d. h. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The sero-conquestrian rates for anti-hbs were 74,2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month 6 administered dosage (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study carried out at 12- to including 15-year-old, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 were combined with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">For the 289 persons, whose immunity was valuable, the seroprotary rates (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 according to Gabe des 3-Dosenimpfoplastic significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response, which were achieved in a clinical trial study at 1- to 11-year-year a month after the end of the full vaccination (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies the vaccinations were either a 2-Cans-vaccine with Ambirix or a 3-phase-vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatitis A-A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B-surface area.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In those who were at the time of pridimmed between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies have been proven to be proven at least 24 months after immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6 month vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunological campaign against both antigens were comparable to that, which was detected after vaccination of 3 doses with a combined hepatocform- A-virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B-surface area in a dose of 0,5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical trial at 12- to including 15 years of year, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies to be comparable to immunisation within the 0-6- months-vaccine may be compared to that in the 0-12 months phase.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of ambiance in the second year, with the refresher vaccination of a combined Diphtheri- and 8 Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with the first dose of a combined mask-mumps vaccine administered it was the immune response to all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study, which was conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation of adults, showed for the present formulation of similar Seroprotomes and Seroconversions as for the former formulation.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You may feel very tired, have a dark original, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (yellow) and other symptoms which may possibly make a stationary treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix cannot completely protect against infection with hepatitis A- or hepatitis B virus, even if the full vaccine has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child are infected before the administration of both vaccines, Ambirix are already infected with hepatitis A- or hepatitis B virus (although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill / feels) a vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections that cause the liver damage or symptoms which are similar to those following hepatitis A- or hepatitis B infection can not be taught.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• if you have already shown an allergic reaction to ambique or any part of this vaccine including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can express through itching rash, respiratory or andic's face or tongue. • if with you / your child has performed an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B. • if you / your child has a serious infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to quickly have a protection against Hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the usually made administration of the second vaccination).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child of a vaccine with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend that you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis A- / hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased content of effective components per vaccine dose (360 ELISA units of a formal hepatitis A-virus and 10 microgram of a combined hepatitis B-surface treatment).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination of this vaccine with decreased content is usually administered one month after the first dose and may give you a vaccinction before the end of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambirix will suffer from heavy clots, under the skin and not in the muscle tissues. • if you are weakened / your child due to illness or treatment in your / her cell resistance, or if you / your child are undergoing to be a heralysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix cannot be given in these cases, but the immune response of these persons on the vaccination cannot be sufficient so that a blood test can be necessary to see how strong the reaction is to vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Now you take your doctor if you take your child to take additional medicinal products (including those that you have received without prescription), or if you / your child have recently been vaccinated / has been given or immunoglobulins (antibodies) have been planned, or this is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">But it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B virus.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If any other vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambirix, should be vaccinated in separate places and as possible from different extremities.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix should be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, Ambirix pregnant or nursing women will not be administered unless it is urgent to vaccinated both against Hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if you have shown an allergic reaction to Neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2797">As usual (more than 1 case per 10 perimed doses): • pain or complaints at the stichar or redness • Matiness • Enzability • Headache • Appetitmangel</seg>
<seg id="2798">Service often (up to 1 case per 10 perimed doses): • swelling at the injections • Fieber (via 38 ° C) • Benefness • gastro-intestines</seg>
<seg id="2799">Further side effects that have been reported for days or weeks after vaccination with comparative combination- or substitutes for Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B very rare (less than one case per 10,000 contracted cans) are:</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs to 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data that have been known since issuing the first approval for the transport, the CHMP opinion that the value-risk-ratio for Ambirix continues.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix only spent in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available security data for this medicine are limited because of the low patient position.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonaps can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzymdefective or with hyperammonial encephalopathy (brain damage, as a result of high ammonium concentration) in pre-history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonaps is divided - split into several single trousers to meals - swallowed under the food or via a neurostomata (through the abdominal ceiling into the stomach of a leading tube) or a nasogonde (through the nose in the stomach of a leading tube).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, as Ammonaps not compared to any other treatment or with placebo (a hypoque ament that is called without substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonaps also may lead to Appetiteness, a abnormal purity, headache, headache, liquidity, likeness, vomiting, anxiety, rash, rash, irritation, irritation, irritation, or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The committee for human therapeutic agents (CHMP) attained to the conclusion that Ammonaps in patients with disorders of the uretic-cycle on high ammoniasis has been effectively prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonaps was approved under "exceptional circumstances," as due to the rarity of the illness at the time of approval, approval was limited to this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indigenous to all patients where a complete enfymmangel is already manifested in a newborn age (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a belated form (incomplete end metabolic disease, which manifests itself after the first life cycle) there is an indication of the use when in the anamnese a hyperammonic encephalopathy exists.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with slip dysfunction, AMMONAPS is also available in granulatform.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated with consideration of the protein tolerance and the growth and development of the patients in the daily intake of patients.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, normal daily dose-dose is sodium levels: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as income-growing and adult.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer from an early lack of carbamyl phosphate bladder or Ornithintranscarf, the substitution of Citrulline or Arginine is required in a dosage of 0,17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an Argininosuccinatsynthetic deficiency have to gain arginine in a dosage of 0,4 - 0,7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered patients with slip dysfunction, as a risk for the emergence of oophagusulcera exists when the tablets are not immediately visible in the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium ylbutyributary that is equivalent to maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be applied in patients with congestive heart failure and severe kidney failure and odeformation of clinical trials only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since Metabolisation and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat over the liver and the kidneys occur, AMMONAPS should only be applied with patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The meaning of these results in reference to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">With subcutaneous Iron Sabe by phenylacetate on young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg) it came to a slowing of neuronal multiplication and to a disturbed loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a consuming irritation of crushing synapses and a diminished number of functioning neurons in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate will take into the mother's milk, and for that reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the lactation period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trial with AMMONAPS, at 56% of the patients had at least one undesirable event (AE) on and at 78% of these undesirable events have been understood that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very frequently (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic response to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old recital patient, which developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with Laktattosis, heavy hypottopenie, periphery Neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred at a 5 month old toddler with an accidentally single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed with intravenous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day an dosislimit neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound, which is caused by acetyulation with glutamine to phenylyl glutamine, which will be eliminated via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Puschiometric is seen phenylacetylglutamine with urea comparable (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative bearer for the elimination of surplus-consuming nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the uretic cycle may be assumed that for every gram it can be used sodium phenylbutyrat between 0,12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is put at an early stage and the treatment will be started to improve the chances of survival and the clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the earliest manifested form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in the New Year was almost always infects, and the disease conducted even in treatment with Peritonealdialysis and essential amino acids, or with their cup-free analogue within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Due to hemoralysis, the exploitation of alternate paths of nitrogen excretion (sodium hydrochloric acid), protocumbenzoat and sodium hydrochloric acid, it was possible to diagnose the survival rates of postsalal at postpartal (however, within the first life cycle) diagnosed in 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyperopultural encephalopathy was the survival rate 100%, but even with these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-manic form of the disease (including feminine patients with heterozygothic form of Ornithintranscarce-deficiency), which were treated by a hyperammonaphenylbutorat and a proteindecreased diet, the overrate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits are also hardly reversible and in some patients may occur another deterioration of the neurological state.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrat is oxiously is oxided, which is in liver and kidney enzatic, with glutamine conjuly, whereby phenylacetylglutamine occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolic pathia in Plasma and Urin were obtained by Gabe of a single dose of 5 g Natriumphenylbutyl with liver cirrhosis as well as repeated Gaben from oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behavior of phenylbutyrat and its metabolic disorders also has also been studied in cancer patients following intravenous form of sodium ylbutary (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After a oral dose of 5 g Natriumphenylbutyrat in tablet form, 15 minutes after the ingestable Plasmakonzentrations of phenylbutyrat have been established.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary medicines or hemmoglobinoeopathies after different doses phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) the next morning after nightly fascysts no phenylacetate can be admittable in the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">With three of six patients with liver cirrhosis that have been repeatedly treated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day orally in three individual doses), the moderate phenylacetate concentration in the plasma seal on the third day five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Discharge The drug is dropping within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100% in the form of conjugifted product phenylphosphylglutamine over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">After the results of the Micronucleus tests had Natriumphenylbutyrat with toxicity and not toxic doses. (investigation 24 and 48 h following oraler administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is taken either orally (infants and children who cannot swallow any tablets, or patients with slip problems) or over a neurostomachment or a nasal form.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, normal daily dose-dose is sodium levels: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as income-growing and adult.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serumproteins in plasma should be held within the normal area.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients who suffer from an early lack of carbamyl phosphate bladder or Ornithintranscarf, the substitution of Citrulline or Arginine is required in a dosage of 0,17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrat, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium bisylbutary that is equivalent to maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When Rattenfush have been exposed before the birth phenylacetate (active Metabolit of phenylbutyrat), it was found for lesions in the pyramids of the brain bark.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic response to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old recital patient, which developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with Laktattosis, heavy hypottopenie, periphery Neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Puschiometrically seen is phenylacetylglutamine with urea comparable (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative bearer for the elimination of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on research on the excretion of phenylyl glutamine in patients with disorders of the uretic cycle, can be assumed that for every gram it can be used sodium phenylbutorat between 0,12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are also hardly reversible, and in some patients may occur another deterioration of the neurological state.</seg>

<seg id="2862">With this procedure, the small measuring spoon ranges between 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8,6 g Natriumphenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to obtain the medication above a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water (the solvility of sodium phenylbutyrat amounts to 5 g in 10 ml water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain Lebailenzymes are missing, so that they accumulate the stipulated waste products, which are accumulated after eating proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If you are examining laboratory studies, you must notify the doctor that you take AMMONAPS, since sodium phenylbutyrat can influence the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronarsyndroms" (ACS, decreased blood flow to the heart), for example, by instabili Angina (a form of pains in the chest with different strength) or myocarnation (heart attack) (an anomal measured value at the electrocardiogram or EKG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">Is angielox in preventing blood clauses in patients who retreat one PCI, becomes a higher dosage administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can contribute to the maintenance of blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI Express.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Anned 14 000 patients took part in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of Angiox with allotrotein-IIb / IIIA inhibitors (GPI, a different medicine to prevent clots) with the conventional combination-treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulans) and a GPI compared.</seg>

<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of a initial intravenous bolusement of 0,75 mg / kg body weight and a lot of hierarchy with intravenous intravenous infusion with a dose of 1,75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and effectiveness of a single bolus form of angiox has not been studied and is not recommended, even if a short PCI operation is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">This value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened under 225 seconds, should be a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the appearance of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicines should be carefully mixed before the application and the Bolusselsis can be measured rapidly intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds, a further monitoring is no longer required, provided the 1,75 mg / kg infusion is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney dysfunctions (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which will be subjected to PCI (whether with Bivalirudin against ACS or not), should be used a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Is the ACT's value below 225 seconds, is a second Boluspsis of 0.3 mg / kg and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Boluspsis is again to prove once again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, performed in the phase III- PCI-Study (REPLACE-2) which led to approval, the ACT lay value 5 minutes by the property of the Bivalirudin-Bolus without dosisAdjustment at an average 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients the angielox is contraindicated (see under section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">The treatment with Angiox can be introduced 30 minutes after termination of the intravenous Hepitarian Hepher or 8 hours after the completion of the subcutaneous glarin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• famous hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or other components or against militiine • active bleeding or increased blood pressure. • severe uncontrolled hypertension and subverable bacterial infection. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and in dialytic patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are to be monitored during the treatment carefully with regard to symptoms and signs of blood pressure, especially when Bivalirudin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if PCI-patients under Bivalirudin's most bleeding occur at arterial indictaion may occur in patients who undergo a perkutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), during the treatment in principle of bleeding bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are treated warfarin and treated with Bivalirudin, a monitoring of the INR factory (International Standards Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value is attained to the treatment with Bivalirudin to the treatment existing level.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Departing from the knowledge of the active mechanism of anti-agulants (Hepitarin, Warfarin, Thrombolytika or Thrombozytenaggregationshemmer) can be understood that these agents increase the bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In combination of Bivalirudin with Thrombozytenaggregations or anticoagulants are the clinical and biological hemostine parameters in each case regularly.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The animal-experimental measurements have been inadequate in terms of effects on pregnancy, the embryo / fetal development, the use or postnatal development (see under Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIA Inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either infractionated Hepatica or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIA Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalirudin group as well as in the comparative-catered groups, it came in women as well as in patients over 65 years more frequently to undesirable events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Heavy bleeding were defined according to ACUITY and Timi standards for heavy bleeding as in the readings of table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy bleeding occurred at Bivalirudin alone significantly less frequent than in the groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIA inhibitor and Bivalidrudin plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY heavy clung was defined as one of the following events: intracranate, tracperitoneal, intraocular or surgical intervention, minimizing the hemmop binary of ≥ 3 g / dl with well-known bloodstream, removes due to a blood pressure, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequent watched bleeding location, which occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally) were "other" punctuation, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on effects are based on the data of a clinical study with Bivalirudin at 6000 patients who separators a PCI.</seg>

<seg id="2920">Both light and heavy bleeding occurred at Bivalirudin significantly less frequent than in the comparative group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIA inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects which are not listed above, were reported according to comprehensive use in practice and are arranged according to system composition. in table 6 summarized.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In the case of overdose, the treatment with Bivalirudin will immediately break down and the patient is engaging with regard to signs of hemorrhage.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific type inhibitor, which is located both by the catalytic center and the Anionencoder region of Thrombin, irrespective of whether Thrombin is tied in the liquid phase or at the Gerinnsel.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The bond of Bivalirudin on Thrombin, and thus its effect, is reversible because Thrombin turn splits the bond of Bivalirudin-Arg3-Pro4, thus the function of the active center of Thrombin regenerated.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, by Bivalirudin with serum of patients with which it has come to hephibitioned Thrombozytopenie / heparininduzipped Thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS), does not induce a Thrombozyten-aggregational campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients bivalirudin is a dosis- and concentric anticoagic effect that is occupied by extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI slot was conducted in the patients there should be an additional Bolus of 0.5mg / kg Bivalirudin and infusion for the duration of the surgery to 1,75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, unfailing Hepin or Enoxaparine was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acutem coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with an unabili Angina / non-ST-Hebungsinfectious market (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in Arm A and B were also randomised to obtain a GPIIb / IIIA Inhibitor either before the start of the angiography (at the time of random) or in PCI.</seg>

<seg id="2939">Clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on applying Angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacological properties of Bivalirudin were evaluated in patients suffering from a perkutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) as well as with patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivalirudin as Peptid is going to have a catabolism in its amino acid parts with subsequent reenhancing the amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolit, who resulted from the split of the Arginvariable sequence through Thrombin, is not effective due to the loss of his affinity to the catalytic center of Thrombin.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children over six years with diabetes that need treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or the upper arm, or as a permanent infusion with a insulin pump is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin into the regulation of glucose piegels (sugars) in the blood or that insulin may not be effective.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin is very low-tested by humaninsulin, and the change means that it has faster and a shorter activity has as a short-effective humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a durable insulin in patients with type-1 diabetes, where the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">With type-2 diabetes, where the body of insulin is not effective, Apidra was examined in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the change of concentration of substance glycosylided hemmoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how good the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type-1 diabetes was a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin expires.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type-2 diabetes, the reduction of the HbA1c concentration was in both six months after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0,30% in human-malins.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against insulin or any other components, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra must be customized if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucosities.</seg>
<seg id="2976">September 2004 the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Germany GmbH approval for the transport of Apidra in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal column, the upper chamber or the Deltamuseum or subcutaneous through continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal thickness.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the decreased Glukoneogenesis capacity and the diminished insulin barber, the insulin is for patients with a limitation of live function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the substance, the stamp (Her- / -), the insulin (normal, NPH, galvanised, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can move a change in the insulin form.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An inadequate dosage or the breakage of a treatment, particularly in patients with an insulin gene, can lead to a hyperglycaemia and a diabetic ketoazisis; these states are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Changing a patient to another insulin or insulin by another manufacturer should take place under stringent medical supervision and can make a change of dosage required.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the substance profile of the used insulin and can therefore change when changing the treatment cheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Among the substances, which can increase the bleeding activity and increase the inclination to Hypoglycaemias, oral antidiabetic, fibrokeryllin, hydrooxetine, monoamine-oxicase (MAO) -Hemmer, Propoxyphen, Salizylates and Sulfonamid-antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympathetic, such as bets, cllonidine, Guanethidin, and reserpine the symptoms of noreplicated counter-regulation will be weakened or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive factors showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and Humaninsulin in terms of pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin is overthrown into the human mother's milk, but in general insulin is neither in the mother's milk, nor will it resorate after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Following are the investigators listed from clinical trials, according to system organs and sorted according to decreasing the frequency of their appearance (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rarely: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency on the basis of ordbait data inestimable).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Kaltgevity, cool, and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or Tremors, fear, unusual creation, or weakness, confusion, concentration, hyper, hyposity, changes of vision, headaches, nausea and heart knock.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Wird fails to switch the injecting location within the injection-range, can occur in the result a Lipodystrophy at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Heavy hypoglycaembodies can be treated by a intramuscular or subcutaneous injecting of glucose (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a trained person, or by intravenous glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">According to a gluing object, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to identify the Ur- thing for heavy hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin shifts the blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) as well as by the inhibition of glucose-production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that subcutaneous gauges of insulin types occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with hu- manem Normalinsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type-1-Diabetes melli- Tus showed insulin measuring range from 0.075 to 0,15 m / kg a disproportionate glucosant effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a subproportionate increase of glucosity effect, just like humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has twice as fast as fast as normal humaninsulin and achieves the complete glucosity effect effect about 2 hours earlier than Humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data has been seen that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable postprandiale glycemic control is achieved as with humanic Normalinsulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal was pressed, a better postpranate control was given as having humanic Normalinsulin, which has been given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The insulin use is applied for 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a comparable glycemic control is given as with human normal Normalinsulin, which is given 2 mesh in front of the meal (see picture 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin at Gabe 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal was given in comparison to human normal Normalins, the 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before the start of the meal (figure 1A) and compared to human normal Normalins, the 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) was given before a meal (figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lulisin at Gabe 15 minutes (GLULISIN - after the beginning of the meal in comparison to humanized Nor- malinsulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the beginning of the meal (figure 1C).</seg>
