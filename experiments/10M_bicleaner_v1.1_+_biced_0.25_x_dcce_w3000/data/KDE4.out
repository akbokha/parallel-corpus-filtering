the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ cross ; create another view for objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ Type @-@ ode / directory at local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbols and text views , in order to view the content of your local fil@@ esystem .
the special feature of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of , screw@@ ed folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree map . each object is displayed by a rectang@@ le , whose area has to be proportional to its size . this size must possess the sum total of the sizes of the sub@@ ordin@@ ate objects of an object small or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or folder , the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files , even then can easily be recognized , when a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX Â® command can be seen .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap @-@ representation a rectang@@ le , that represents a file or a folder in your fil@@ esystem . for simpler navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles possess reasonable color @-@ ri@@ ots and voice settings .
the colour of a rectang@@ le , which is swit@@ ched in color mode , can be either a depth for the light detection of the sc@@ ach@@ ment or the figure of another file property , such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rectang@@ le can be lab@@ eled with the different characteristics of the appropriate file or folder . for each feature you can specify , if there is enough space for the presentation , or whether the area of sub@@ ordin@@ ate rectang@@ le is to be used ( however , display errors through restrictions on the sign of the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) . furthermore , you can define the relative position of the lab@@ eling in the right rectang@@ le .
in Dar@@ ling algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the general rule should be proportional to the size of the item . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always to be observed . there will be a frame that will then no longer be available to the loss of entries . please note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectang@@ le square is square .
as split@@ ting the area of an entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries is provided , implementation is left . here , it is crucial to al@@ locate the areas such as possible , that juris@@ dictions arise , which are as square @-@ shaped . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns or record @-@ division .
you can set the minimal area for an entry on the menu entry insert in area . instead , a cat@@ er@@ pattern in the area of an or@@ derly listing is drawn to indicate that this area is actually covered by an assigned entry .

you can also visit the di@@ gi@@ val ; homepage to visit news about shared versions and other information about &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; to experience .
the best start to get to &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; take part in the developer &apos;s mailing list . instructions for reference in the developer mailing list of &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ;
if you want &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; for the first time , you will be wondering where you want to store your images and your database . you can specify a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the folder folder folder , to select a folder .
in the second field you must provide a local folder on your computer . here , the data collection is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders like you want . &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; you will use in addition as an al@@ ben@@ library . settings di@@ gi@@ Kam incorpor@@ ates collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder containing images as a base folder . &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; considers every sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed at this time , while trying to see the folder you will see a progress display like this :
&amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; dur@@ st re@@ acting the libr@@ arian in its entire depth . you cannot shut up any sub@@ folder , unless it iste came in a hidden folder . this you can insert extraordinary and di@@ gi@@ fted ; settle a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder containing photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ ign do not take photos as ic@@ ons . you can change the photos by taking a popular photo from the album and it is used on the folder symbol . further details can be found in the section albums .
once you have con@@ figured the base folder you can set in &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; your digital camera came up . after that , you should learn how to use my albums and My sample box to manage your photos in the albums .

modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera is then used as a USB mass storage device . the camera is then used as a flash drive . older cameras will also be used for connection to the connected port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital cameras , which is an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras supported . it also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , which was developed from the International Imag@@ ing Industry Association . it allows transmission of images of digital cameras to b@@ ills and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need of additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the calcul@@ ator . since photos in general are large files and transmission belts are out@@ dated . &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; supports these cameras and leads the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must be extrac@@ ted with li@@ x@@ if support to read the predic@@ tive images from di@@ gi@@ Kam . if the ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might be able to worry about anything or the generation might be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; is how easy it can extend to expand its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the KDE Image plug @-@ ins Interface Project ( manual ) is a approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; , K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate pictures in virtually any way as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it &apos;s much simpler , &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; by writing a small module to complement one function as the changes in &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either delete the side bar with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
you can draw and drop images everywhere : you can drop a picture in another part of the alarm system , above the horizontal separ@@ ating line or into another application window . the only restriction is that the image is not in keywords , file list , or search list .
- a date selection allows you to raise the most common : JPEG , PNG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol@@ ism only if this one is shown on the fil@@ ename only if this one sees the symbols shown . what fields can be displayed can be con@@ figured in the dialog of the settings .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; puts an organized view on your photo models . these albums are managed according to the folder in which they were stored on the hard disk , according to the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ properties or after the date , where the album was created first , sorted . the date can be changed in the album qualities .

the buttons el@@ der , average , new : these put the date on that of the oldest , the latest image or the average of the album . first , the average tries to calculate the images from its EX@@ IF data . if this fails , instead the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder .
if you first opened an album in &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; the first picture in the album is chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; chosen . this will help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select a different photo as a symbol .

information about each photo will be displayed below the corresponding preview . what information is , you can change about settings ; select here the albums page and adjust the area he@@ ater to your wishes .
the pres@@ um@@ ers have help files . if you ho@@ ver a moment on a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the tags of a photo . the screen photo above in the section Int@@ ro@@ duction into the main window indicates such an assistant .

Met@@ adata are defined as data about data . met@@ adata in accordance with your definition of data that provide information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
I d@@ are to claim if you need more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need to find out more than 1000 photos on your computer . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then use not sure how many photos you have , then use very fast sou@@ ps and a secure archi@@ ving on which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you do and need to know before you need anything into your system . you have to decide whether other access to your photos should be stored on your computer or on a network drive &amp; etc . make sure you have to switch to a larger drive .
maybe you &apos;ll be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be found quickly over your location . if you were able to organize enough photos , then you will sub@@ folder as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; use . export is a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements such as re@@ ver@@ sion@@ ing of the photos , archi@@ ving , job creation , constant import of images on different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % employment are deleted and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the st@@ acking simple . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and working files are simpli@@ fied a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original one or a deriv@@ ative picture .
we also recommend the option met@@ adata to save in the setup page of the met@@ adata in &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; this ensures that Ex@@ if@@ - and IP@@ TC data will be written into the file . if you forget it , then you can save the met@@ adata out of the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the menu album .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ? to make it a met@@ adata editor available for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now , the real work begins , since you should now pick any photo keywords , marking and score . of course , you can select all the images that will need the same attribute and set the value then . you start the best with the rating or ranking . this makes sense , since you can focus on the best photos .
let &apos;s now let us take key@@ word , key@@ word , as you often called on other programs , or categories . all three are Syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import kat@@ alogue images from another source of embedded keywords , then the tree for you will build the images in the right place . the re@@ sort of Hier@@ archy within the tree is no problem and can simply be settled by the pull of a sub@@ tree on another . the modified keywords will be done by &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; updated while it pursu@@ es the sub @-@ trees .
the graphic shows how different met@@ adata v@@ ass@@ ed itself . this is a very gro@@ be representation , since each block of met@@ adata in truth consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar dates refer to properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to complaints or comments , the third important tool to catalog your met@@ adata .
do you want most anyone to simply see your photos , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographer and agencies . they are certainly interested in how your photos arrive .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer you start looking at some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you this the cross space of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after the landing . Wow ! you start to dream , associations , memories , the historical time span is again present , you might even hear the silence . so your perception of this panor@@ amas has completely changed .
for others who consider your photos , the title is possibly more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show images you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer the importance to the viewer , to help Him understand about the mot@@ if that you have moved to understand what you understand .
it is fine when a picture is not perfect if it has the strength to work alone with just a label for himself alone .
with &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; you can use as much text , in a glob@@ alized Alp@@ hab@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as being printed . KDE even provides you with a spell chec@@ ker . you can even tell it for your wishes into the marking and / or the title of the web @-@ gallery system .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet before Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? good , because with images the train moves the spatial presentation now already with light speed .
the possibilities for Geol@@ ocation util@@ isation are already countless , and will be able to repeat in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can open your travel virtually through photographs with geographical references . you can also export images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps spect@@ ator .
&amp; quot ; Copy@@ left is a match with copyright and calls on the practice the copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms are also in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; as information should be depos@@ ited :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization has been used , it should not be changed . this field neither comm@@ as nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons are supported as separ@@ ators .
Aut@@ ort@@ it@@ el ( syn@@ onym for author line ) : associated with the author . examples of this field contains the name of the photographer . examples of this can be titles as : employee photographer , fre@@ el@@ ance photographer or inde@@ er commercial photographer . as this is a note to the Auth@@ ors area , this field must be well @-@ filled .
editors ( syn@@ onym for vendors ) : use the provider to identify who works there . if the photographer is working here , the photographer can be listed here . if the photographer is listed here , the image is a camp site , then the image / agency will display the image here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright off@@ ences , although this is no protection against abuse . anyone who uses a little more than basic knowledge within the work with calcul@@ ator , can delete or change . the solution to this problem are digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this protection is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important against this .
the digital water@@ mark is unique in the picture . &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; in the near future , such module is available for st@@ acker processing .

of course we are not talking about CDs that are lost on the street or brand . these kinds of losses are the same that may happen to you with traditional pap@@ er@@ pictures or negative . in this section about problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest database company in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes a loss of data .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs must be treated cau@@ ti@@ ous and can no longer be bought as a couple of years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in the archive quality . there are offers of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for yourself . whether you believe this lies in your mess@@ enger .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be read@@ able , but you can use this risk in which you will use good de@@ cks and good recording facility . the best DVD recording facility are not much more costly than the cheapest but you write much reliable . so it turns to select the right one .
CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to mistakes , even if you have just written it . therefore , they use a control mechanism to defend oneself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for form@@ att@@ ing and control parameters . despite this massive protection , they use by chemical ag@@ eing , ul@@ tr@@ violet light , scr@@ at@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for broken CDs and DVDs , there are a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently causes mir@@ acles for CDs and DVDs . it also runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but there are also similar applications that damaged data from damaged disk@@ ettes , dis@@ ks , f@@ boards , USB drives , etc .
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray discs to win the For@@ mat@@ ism to win HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six@@ sm@@ al the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that has been said to CDs and DVDs and of course also applies to Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good recording unit on high quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ etary format . read the media using a description , date &amp; author characteristic and afterwards to a clean , dark dry and especially animals protected place . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
flo@@ pp@@ ers reserve your statistics for you . your manufacturing mechanisms include a new disk , but not the data . Google represents a large field study on the error @-@ mechanisms of hard drives : dis@@ errors study
in brief : dis@@ ks keeping up the longest in Temper@@ ature Sin@@ ce from 35 Â° C to 45 Â° C . electronic parts of the Cont@@ roll@@ ers are the most common error item , SM@@ ART may not notice this error . some of the SM@@ ART defects must not cancel the immediate forthcoming incident . these are particularly les@@ bian and publisher . the expected lifetime time is between 4 and 5 years .
this is just about the complete ver@@ est due to over@@ load . of course , you may also have data loss due to a black@@ out before you have secured the files , but these losses normally allow themselves to recover without major problems .
while most electrical devices electric bre@@ aches no much , it looks different in devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these can cause heavy damage , hardware replacement , destroyed mother@@ boards , and other defects , thus protecting yourself from un@@ avoid@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against power tips is an over@@ load protection . this is a device that absorbed part of energy heat and the rest gro@@ unded . it is usually available in the form of a socket . however , you don &apos;t think any plug @-@ in bar also contains an over@@ load protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ load protection , then you should be careful that he meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to the protection against light@@ ning stroke and thus protects the correctly connected devices .
because a over@@ load of each cable can use to your computer , you should be sure that even all the periph@@ er@@ als can be connected to your system . some manufacturers generate over@@ load @-@ load , which also includes a telephone connection for your mo@@ dem . others provide connectivity options for the co@@ ax@@ ial cable of cable mo@@ de@@ ms and television card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ load protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks , and therefore they also contain the protection for the mo@@ dem . therefore , you are ideal for travelling .
while an over@@ load protection protects your system from smaller fluctu@@ ations into the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete loss . even a fall of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . therefore it can therefore be sensible to invest in a un@@ interrupted power supply .
besides the protection from over@@ load these devices , these devices can be automatically stored battery power . some models allow them to save your data and keep the system ordered again . if you &apos;re buying a US@@ V then you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements as an over@@ load protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the attached software is interesting .
raise the potential risk that your b@@ illing system is exposed to and and compare its security with electricity dis@@ rup@@ tions with the cost of avoiding this . a high quality over@@ load protection can take you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference if you think how well your machine is protected so you should remember all cables once you drive to the holidays .
the Amazon Web @-@ Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - einen easy storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
they are compared to hard drives , however very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data on the compar@@ atively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution to a local loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com are at your disposal . your free memory is available to 1 GB and you will not have your images available in full resolution online . the professional version provides you more in case of Flick@@ r dramatically more . for $ 25 per year you get un@@ restricted memory , which should only be reviewed in reality .
from the point of view of the data protection the Web @-@ solutions are very secure . transmission errors are certified thanks to the TCP protocol and included in the large companies it will contain a backup and an integrated memory . that &apos;s why they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ ased .
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all the transm@@ issions are pr@@ one to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem and b@@ ust provide at least the database integrity between operating systems and hard drive .
the worst thing is that you no one says when a transmission error occurred , not if this occurred in your hardware . it &apos;s quite distur@@ bing that there should be no protection in your computer . no one seems to have not meant to have . the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer place than the inside your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission loss as they produce interference within the data currents . in normal fil@@ es@@ ystems these errors stay un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not currently affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates who are able to deal with turn@@ tables on a lower level and is available under a GPL @-@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ al fil@@ esystem . this is still in the Alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms and is available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % in the job systems . not@@ ebooks are already the percentage of the theft of 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most of them . it results in a lower damage , such as theft or re@@ installations . and it is currently being limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been spot@@ ted for a long time .
open Source Date@@ is@@ ysteme are less pr@@ one to data loss as propri@@ etary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ F@@ s , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the spread file systems . a very good English article on this can be found here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investig@@ ating process during a sudden break is higher and an un@@ defined status will be avoided if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft , and human errors are the root causes of data loss .
digital cameras are removed from digital cameras , 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture displays from fundamental physical limits . it is that the technology continues to develop there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and smok@@ ers of all types of light sensors are no longer far away from this border .
today cameras go towards the 10 Meg@@ api@@ xel picture . even if this resolution is too high for comp@@ ass cameras and the end result is the optimum for comp@@ actor cameras . even DSLR Cam@@ eras have the limit at 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ api@@ xel . for higher resolution , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard drive today get you today for 100 &amp; euro ; therefore , do not make anyone else responsible for data losses . so , make your data often after a plan and test this backup before you make ir@@ relevant anything like the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of plates or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you make daily use of your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a bolt will have you lucky if the drive has not been connected at the moment .
a disaster moves locally and destroyed a lot . forget aircraft uns@@ gl@@ Ã¼cke : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they normally concern a whole room or the complete house .
therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ ron@@ ement means always a local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a frequent reason for a loss of data despite the backup of panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differ@@ ential Equ@@ ations : a backup of the files has been modified since the last complete assurance . creates a complete momentum to two periods : the complete assurance and the last differ@@ ing assurance .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been modified since the last backup . generates several times . you can restore the original status at any time in which such a backup has been made . this backup comes up to a version system next with the exception that it is only cam@@ ast@@ ed and is not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike the script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file shell scripts , sync just the difference of files that really have been changed . this happens comp@@ ressed and if you want to increase security through ssh .
secure important pictures directly after you have stored on your computer to DVD or other optional medium .
this procedure will allow you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time you come to securing a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . any further di@@ lution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review .
topics : met@@ adata , in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , Associ@@ ated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ finding images and met@@ adata , copy of images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alisation , devices , ... , use of Internet .
therefore valuable pictures survive the next 40 year , that is about the time span in which you really are interested in , because they remember your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be respected :
as the future is un@@ predic@@ table because of your nature you need to see everything that is said today . unfortunately , there is no other way than a certain vig@@ il@@ ance to leave . unfortunately , there is no other possibility as the current system is back@@ wards compatible . the less variations you have used in the past , the more readily available is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered through the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is nowadays available for everyone . therefore , if you have an old system that is important to reading your pictures , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the professional way for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means ever growing .
let &apos;s take the scal@@ ability and you want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition . at * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift to a new record :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record was detected by the system , but do not hang them off .
Â£ / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ dc # source is / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / sd@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ ytes ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and re@@ iser@@ fs &amp; Dollar ; / dev / sad / 1 # change the size of re@@ frac@@ tures if needed
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software is available , you can read it yourself . this task will be easier for year to year .
GI@@ F is a propri@@ etary , pat@@ ented format that will slowly dis@@ appears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more .
PNG was used as an open source standard of GI@@ F . it can be more funny , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit per colour @-@ channel information , but not as many as TI@@ FF needs and a slow comp@@ ression . this format we would like to recommend you for stor@@ ing your pictures .
TI@@ FF was widely used as picture format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ comp@@ ressed form or in a container with a dis@@ si@@ ent comp@@ ression sal@@ sion@@ ed mus ( Def@@ late ) . a problem is however that this format has been adapted by many people . therefore , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digit@@ ale Neg@@ ative file format is a licence @-@ free and open raw material that has been developed from Adobe Systems . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and is committed to the use of Met@@ adata . a handful of camera bodies are already available and we hope you will use the co @-@ competition Canon and Nikon it at some point .
this may be one of the reasons why in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a mark@@ er of XML ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archi@@ ving a original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , to archive . however , it may result in the link between the met@@ adata and the image file , and as above noted the raw material . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything there together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization working for fully compatible online met@@ adata standards , including the activities of D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enligh@@ tening efforts to reach a far @-@ reaching acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the maps or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera e@@ edi@@ um , you can use this as temporary assurance .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
for a subtle processing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; edit , then you should add the met@@ adata again . these were cut under circumstances from other programs .
protect the edited paintings for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only to web@@ galleries , f@@ use in MPEG , use in cont@@ akt , print &amp; etc .
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; to get in the section adding pictures to an album you can add a description as you have already on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import images to your album database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; connect them to the computer , turn the camera on the ad mode and turn it off . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , this tries to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a Fer@@ tig indicator is available at the bottom and the preliminary images of all photos on the camera will display . some cameras do not represent a pre@@ viewer . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol of the file order for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera appear .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to each entry . with the side characteristics and met@@ adata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an item or its met@@ adata .
this dialog shows file characteristics and the photo information to be stored internally by the camera . a symbol shows that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that with some digital cameras do not provide all the information available .
the rider Met@@ adata shows the internal met@@ adata such as ex@@ if , producer , GPS etc . the image . this information is the same as for the met@@ adata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; or picture editing . note that these met@@ adata are not available with some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer , the click on the button Download and then download the selection of All . this releases photos from your camera into a single album in &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; . in downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures are safe to delete in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can select only the desired with the standard choice methods of &amp; k@@ de ; select the button below and then download the chosen button . the button chosen can be downloaded , until you have selected some photos .
if your camera is supported this , an option is now available . these images have been downloaded by &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; in this case the new pictures have been selected with a star in the showcase . if you choose this option , course , only the new images are downloaded .
if you want to download the buttons , you can download the target album , displayed in which the photographs are shown . the list of existing albums is displayed just like normal folder . select the target album out of the list and press OK .
after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; load the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by using the button Clear . if you want to delete only a few , then you must select this first and then delete the delete chosen .
note that there is no way you have deleted from the camera to restore it . so you should carefully review whether the photos were successful in a &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; -@@ Album have been downloaded , before you want to delete them from the camera . if you want to delete it from camera , as this is much faster .
cameras use as a fil@@ ename for the photos often not particularly expres@@ sive names . the fil@@ ename are normally rec@@ ti@@ fied , after taking photographs of the camera deleted . this can be used to double fil@@ ename in the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was made to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ames .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirror @-@ based sub@@ categories . if you use this latter option , a folder per day is automatically created .
the options Dur@@ ing the transmission opens three more options that are performed prior to the photos stored on the record . the first two concern the data about the author in the section standard read@@ ability . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the terms included in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct the date &amp; time for all downloaded photos .
if you prefer a different format format than standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix Fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % N : % M : % S . place your option date &amp; time . for further modifications you should read the help of command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the camera stream name , you will have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in small shopping letters . or in large letters , if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ ename , the &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; used for a photo , it is displayed below the name that the camera is available in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are stored and automatically used when you open the camera stamp next time .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to the time point of recording . not all cameras are ready to perform . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ adata you can read further details , about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic spin @-@ off is usually swit@@ ched , and if your camera is not providing this information , the photo is in its original orientation . if you want to switch off the automatic fil@@ ming , use the button Sch@@ weit@@ zer and select the automatic spin in the bottom section of the window .
when your camera is made available via the date on which the photo has been made available , it can be used to download this@@ album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras are provided with the same date . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ a data you can read what information your camera could be embedded in the photos .
this option is usually off , and in this case saves &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; the photos directly on the target album . if you want to change this option , you need to turn this option . use the button fil@@ ename at the bottom of the window .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to load photos from their computers to their camera is the kno@@ b . select a button . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; it appears , in which you can select the files that should be up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
once the selection is done , asks &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; you know where the images will be loaded up . a folder sel@@ ections for the camera appears . select here the desired folder and press OK to load the up@@ loading . the images are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Position@@ ing System ) is used as a general term in this document . there@@ with , a position is designed to be indicated in long@@ itude and lat@@ itude and which can be displayed on a map . the identification of the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system .
not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical place . not everyone uses a plane to account a area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plan@@ er , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have later forgotten where exactly the photo has been made , you can click with a click a browser to locate the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; users just want to locate the location of the photographs , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to send the position data of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data get into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 many GPS data fields are supported , such as the data in these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the correct hardware , via re@@ processing the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for the geographical assignment ( manual ) and lastly via the manual entry of known places .
as far as we know , there are currently no camera integrated with GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receiver . either as the ticket module or transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS @-@ Interface : Co@@ y@@ San@@ Eye I@@ pa@@ q I@@ ke K@@ od@@ ak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can take place with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you must store these data in g@@ px format as this is the only format which is supported by the module for the geographical assignment .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS which can extract the data from pictures and GPS and cor@@ relate it . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itu@@ dinal and long@@ itu@@ dinal or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the sign of coordinates , such as map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle will be created .
map@@ s.@@ google.com shows no European street cards . here are some European pages , at least in french , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; try to give you so much control over his working procedures as possible . change . to access these settings , you must select Settings . the setup dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left side .
this action can be displayed on embedded preview or picture editing . in order to set the standard behaviour of &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the Stand@@ ardi@@ dent@@ ity and copy@@ righ@@ ted data . these data are automatically selected in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields . if the option is selected for downloading from the camera interfaces , these data is being saved into the IP@@ TC fields .
Aut@@ ort@@ it@@ el is a syn@@ onym for editor : this field should contain the professional name of the photographer , such as the employed photographer , fre@@ el@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a more detailed description for the author , this field must be filled .
editors is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this does not have to be the author , such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations should be entered here as this is the image other &amp; quot ; offer . if the image is a camp foto , then the group or agency the image is available here .
the IP@@ TC &apos;s actions store the data into the appropriate IP@@ TC field . thus , the met@@ adata constantly contained in the picture and not only in the database of &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; these met@@ adata also stand in other programs and can be imported into &amp; di@@ gi@@ in ; they can be imported without lost .
images found in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you will add to your photos , with the images contained in the pictures . caution : with pictures , which already contain damage , these are over@@ written by the results .
the page settings contains all options for the information that appear when the mouse cur@@ sor in the main window above a file . depending on the selected option this information is displayed or not .

the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button fac@@ tions right from each category .
the settings of the lighthouse of &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; however , if you then open the illumin@@ ant , these settings will be swit@@ ched on this page . some pictures have different sizes and the syn@@ ch@@ rone mode is then not available . however , the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size lad@@ en@@ quot ; should you only use on fast computers . if you have one , then you can get better reference results .
by default , the image processing has a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can use the tool@@ bar to use the tool@@ bar in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or brigh@@ ter color in the picture . these colours can be specified here . in picture editing this connection mode can be inserted and swit@@ ched with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling is meant that images can be co@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in color form@@ ations . please read this article in Wikipedia about the near@@ er explanation .
with adjustment PNG @-@ comp@@ ression , you can reduce the size of PNG . this surgery does not reduce the image quality , since PNG uses a ver@@ itable algorith@@ m . if you have a quick machine , you can put this value on high comp@@ ression . it means 1 : a low and 9 a high comp@@ ression .
with the option TI@@ FF files comp@@ ress you can turn the Def@@ late -@@ Com@@ pres@@ sion@@ sal@@ g@@ ist m for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of TI@@ FF images . it has no influence on the image quality , since the Def@@ late -@@ algorith@@ m works dis@@ able .
with the setting of funny JPEG @-@ 2000 files you can be dis@@ si@@ c@@ ated . even if you choose the dis@@ able setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than when the normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , met@@ adata still was not supported , but was in the planning .
in the previous versions of &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; the image processing only was a photo @-@ view for photos . currently , it develops very quickly to a tool for mani@@ pulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the editing .
the default notation is that all green pixels are identical . if you use this option as the Pixel pattern in the output . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option identi@@ fies the picture a little soft , elimin@@ ates but the 2x@@ 2 m@@ ash pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD @-@ quality method .
when this option is set , the whit@@ ish is used immediately by the camera . otherwise , if it is set , the automatic balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white equ@@ als is not set . standard is it a fixed dy@@ balance , which was photograph@@ ed on a white map which was photograph@@ ed in sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super C@@ CD S@@ LR cameras . the using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed pictures in four steps in four steps . for other cameras , this option will be ignored .
the standard is it the sp@@ el@@ ter , so the parts of your images are burned down , due to the in@@ ability of your camera to capture the cutting edge , as it shows the sp@@ elling in various ros@@ at@@ oms . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of missing information from the l@@ edge .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast s@@ ati@@ ous as green and red . &amp; cra@@ b therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixel . of course , this is a matter how much colour or white you want .
when you select the option , you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adapted for each picture individually .
put the L@@ umin@@ ous value according to your taste . you probably have to put it a bit higher than the standard 1 . but this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ing ; image processing . to keep the time for de@@ os@@ a@@ ic@@ ing small , you should do more conservative .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ ic@@ ing algorith@@ m is an digital image process to expect a complete picture of the sub @-@ file sensor which have many cameras and which is known to a matrix of colored pixels . this algorith@@ m is also known as C@@ FA @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ bre@@ kon@@ struction .
&amp; D@@ cra@@ b introduces you three alternatives : Bil@@ in@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for adap@@ tive homogen@@ e@@ ity ) , however , was the first algorith@@ m that was used by D@@ Vik@@ f . however , it generates col@@ art@@ ef@@ acts at edges . Bil@@ in@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick fix with an acceptable result .
if you know the color@@ im@@ ation of your l@@ enti@@ ls you can put the red and blue @-@ proof values here . this is certainly the best method for a different colour correction , since you are performed during the pipe @-@ test .
a profile translated the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; information such as the colour form@@ ations of one color tree in the other are to be interpreted as accurately as possible .
conduct questions , if a picture is open in image processing / colour hand@@ held module with raw files .
color @-@ profile folder , use the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you save all your profiles . &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; investig@@ ates this folder then during the start .
description of ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; default sources ; for your profiles to be depos@@ ited . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color ender view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here are just your pictures and does not manage the whole screen .
the input profiles should fit in the same way . not all profiles are included on the same type . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain shade mapping or gam@@ ble @-@ correction . currently correct d@@ cra@@ w Gamma does not exist for con@@ versions at 16 bit depths . this means you need to perform the color mapping itself .
there are other options like the Soft Proof profile , with which you can em@@ ulate as your printer can be released from one device . this is very useful before you can print , since your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors therefore have very saturated with it . you could manually correct it instead of rely on the blin@@ ding algorith@@ m of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obviously which colour profile is provided for what is provided for . unfortunately , not in the models of Canon . therefore there is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is obviously in@@ official :
enlar@@ ging the style for the target : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Ne@@ utral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image concerned and image processing . by providing this interface it can support &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; many modules have been written to work with each program , which supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select from which you want to use , and these are then downloaded from &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; you will find these modules as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you can see some also in the context menu of the fores@@ ee .
short @-@ command for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short command .
for more information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I @-@ modules you can get over the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ tp : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ged on or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper Reg@@ ulators adjusted the time between the image processes , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other candidates turn off the met@@ adata or , which appears on the lower end of the pictures during the ad .
the camera properties show on the left hand a list of all supported cameras . on the right side there is a button automatic detection , that tries to utilize a camera that is connected to the computer . currently , here are Seri@@ elle , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire Â® mass storage .
at the bottom end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) -@@ mass storage cameras selected from the camera . you have to indicate here the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / re@@ location , specify on which you attach your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , connect them to the ad mode .
pro@@ bi@@ ere you out , whether &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; the camera automatically recognis@@ es . if not , you can set cam@@ er@@ od@@ ell and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera appears in the menu camera .
you can select any design@@ ation for your camera . this will be displayed in the menu of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert it here .
with the option of confirmation for the moving of &gt; pictures in the rub@@ b@@ bin , you can display the loc@@ alities of &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; to delete a photos in an album . in the sections ext@@ ingu@@ ishing of a photo and del@@ eting a album you will find more details .
the editorial changes due to the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly done by &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without any inquiries . otherwise , you need to use the changes to the kno@@ b changes .
you can also read the display of the welcome screen from &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; at the starting point , it acceler@@ ates the start process of &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ;
the attitude to search for new photos is forcing &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos . this extended the start time of &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; if something comes from the base folder , asks &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; you , whether it should delete it from the database .
different shades are in &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; used to custom@@ ize the main window to suit your tastes . these settings can be selected by settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs can be indicated below :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; you will find more information about this tutorial .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and correction and improvement . image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of preview and selection of the item ads .
the picture processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; therefore , they are not part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in paragraph of picture editing .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ ename , current data entry , enlar@@ ging factor and the actual image size .
a menu bar at the top and among them the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most commonly used functions .
the editing functions of picture processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photograph before you use the original image or the button save from the tool@@ bar . remember that you cannot recover the original photo once you have saved the original image .
so you should possibly be able to make a copy of your image before you change it . you can save yourself with file stor@@ ing .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by re@@ produce the original image by re@@ produce the button . you then lose any change that you have performed in the photo since the last time .
virtually any action of the editing process can be und@@ one or restored , the last action can be und@@ re@@ versible by re@@ cl@@ ing re@@ cl@@ ing or restored by selecting Edit from the menu .
if you often use this , you should remember the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to return and make C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift Z to restore .
when you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; over the back @-@ up or re @-@ made button in the tool@@ bar one moment longer press , get an account menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions in between also re@@ versible and restored .
once you have started the picture editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keywords , using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture r@@ unter or the entries in the menu file , you are asked if you want to save them .
you can play in the photo and out zo@@ oming in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the similar menu .
to adjust to a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : enlar@@ ging factor automatically .
view full screen mode shows the photo in full @-@ screen mode . you come in the normal view where you can use the Es@@ c button . normally , you can also change this in the setup dialog by &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; you can call this from the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; main window . see the section for setting the picture editing .
if you want to print the current picture , you can select the image file and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust here settings before you print your photo .
out of the main menu , you can print out individual images or whole sets . all images can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the images with the default methods and select from the menu album printing assist@@ ants . if you follow the assist@@ ants , you just need to make your choice .
this window has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected pictures . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation bar , even in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multi @-@ m@@ ould click on for the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear and again disappear into the edge .
in the description view , you can insert termin@@ ations with unlimited size or insert . notice the remark below . the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed to be used in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support AS@@ C@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments will be cut back to 2000 characters and special characters are re@@ formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC description field in other applications , you should notice these restrictions .
after which you have commented you will use either the kno@@ b or simply change to the next picture , the bill is then stored .
besides the use button , there is a button More . with this you can read further met@@ adata about the selected file or the database . however , you can also use the met@@ adata into the files . but this will always be done if you have selected a met@@ adata stream that is always written to the pictures .
the section assessment shows a review of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and variety . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar , or using the keyboard short@@ cut . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select them and use the context menu .
the rating is written into the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the co@@ ding follows the diagram in the following table :
the key@@ word shows a search box on the fil@@ tering of the keywords , the keywords , and a sel@@ box with the previously mentioned in this &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; a session referred to .
the keywords will be adjusted to the one @-@ given search password . you can easily restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a key@@ word rapidly . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom is another relief to enter keywords at a picture series . if you have given various keywords , these are stored for fast access .
keywords can also be stored by flag@@ ging of the corresponding fields of fields in the tree . all tags of an image are stored into the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a key@@ word in the folder tree , this only will be used to the prot@@ up@@ scale image and not to the whole selection , if you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the section key@@ word filter .
the side@@ bar key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of the images shown on the main window . normally the left side@@ bar is used with their record , - Dat@@ um@@ - , key@@ note and search views . if additionally , one or more key@@ word filter from the right is shown , only the sub@@ set of these two displays will be available only . all keywords are available .
you can also drag and place . suppose you &apos;ve already selected in the main view several pictures to put you with keywords , then you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and put on the selection . then , a dialog appears , you ask if you want to put the keywords .
in the top example , the main window shows the images at a cal@@ ender date . the keywords will be reduced to three pictures . they were selected with Str@@ g + a and then a key@@ word was drawn from the right key@@ word on the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this key@@ word shall be set .
this search for modifications will take place during each start of the program . you can also be swit@@ ched to settings Mis@@ cellaneous .
if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be a or be , you can easily change this with a double @-@ click on the text and in the control range .
( 1 ) : the entry , after which in the database is sought . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , picture , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument to the operator , which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
you can e.g. specify a Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you just need to use the cross field at the end of the rule and then use the button group . the options see as follows :
why have Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flick@@ r were not listed ? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I used it mainly on &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; s concrete implementation adapted .
the reason why you use a colored work@@ flow using the colors of your camera or scanner , you can achieve a pre@@ utable variations from the actually photograph@@ ed or sc@@ ann@@ ed color . with a color@@ fully automatic work@@ flow you can achieve that colors on your monitor you can download or the colors you print or on the web you publish from your digital dark@@ room .
if the theme comes on shade administration , everyone wants to press what buttons it must express for the results he wants . unfortunately , the purpose of this tut@@ orials can provide you adequate background information about colour management . additionally , you should provide links with deeper information that you obtain the required result .
if your image work@@ flow meets all the criteria listed above , you don &apos;t have to worry about colors .
you are working on a monitor which is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ R@@ GB @-@ Far@@ br@@ aum . ( more information can be found below )
your only other image expenditure are by email or the Web , where s@@ R@@ GB of de facto standard is .
so if s@@ R@@ GB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy , why should one use another color tree and make your thoughts about h@@ amen ?
a visual example of Lim@@ itation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colours we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colours that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ hoe region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum , the tri@@ ang@@ ular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimension@@ als representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger farms , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om excell@@ ente page and then click on Info and then information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to imagine my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum ?
yes ! whether you are working at s@@ R@@ GB @-@ Far@@ br@@ aum , or not , you will need to shed your monitor . if you are working as in the color tree of s@@ R@@ GB , you have to select either your monitor to the s@@ R@@ GB standard , a suitable monitor profile , or both .

this tool provides five automatic re@@ visions available to improve the image in most cases . therefore , use it before you try a further manual work .
the functions norm@@ alize , compar@@ isons , automatic down@@ stream and contrast expand out of the menu of the rigi@@ d automatic correction try automatically out of your colors to make the best . they will be experimenting with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scale the lumin@@ ous values above the entire picture , so the dark@@ est point black and the ligh@@ test point to change as bright as possible without its color grad@@ ation . this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or washed .
altern@@ ating : this method is adjustable the illumin@@ ated colour of the colours of the selected image , so that the hist@@ o@@ grams of intro@@ duc@@ tible is as flat as possible . this makes it very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces a very powerful operation , which causes either wonder at an image or destroyed it .
automatic in the same : this method maxim@@ izes the color area in the red , green and blue @-@ channel . you will find the dark and light limits and adjust the red , green and blue channels on the complete hist@@ o@@ gramm@@ age range .
contrast extend : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ ous values of the R@@ GB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values on the wid@@ est possible field and a new ji@@ u@@ st@@ ling of all values in between . this is only visible in balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white @-@ gate of &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white straight out of a photo .
the white @-@ right correction is somewhat limited because over a color tree with 8 @-@ bit per colour can occur . in case you can proceed too far from the original image . if you are able to perform the white @-@ off in the raw mode , which is working in the 16 @-@ bit mode , then your possibilities for correction is better off .
this tool is based on a white margin of copyright from Paw@@ el T. Joch@@ ym . they start using the menu @-@ entry colors White @-@ equal to image processing .
the pres@@ um@@ showcase can be adapted to the size . on the left side are the original image as well as preview the target image . the Pre@@ view is always adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white off , it is enough to click the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target hotel has red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ancy of the Pix@@ els below this mark@@ er is displayed as a vertical line in hist@@ o@@ gramm@@ es .
to the right top is a hist@@ o@@ gramm@@ ar is displayed as soon as you change one parameter . this hist@@ o@@ gramm@@ ar is very helpful , even in well lit pictures , most pixels are very small L@@ umin@@ ous values . with one button you can decide if one of the three colours or your total is indicated . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ancy .
the contrast of your outcome depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow bl@@ ur@@ ry lets you improve the s@@ att@@ end@@ ings of your photos or also download it .
An@@ stat play with the above controls , you should use the colour temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere to the picture preview for the calculation of the color temperature of the white de@@ al@@ location . this type will also set the temperature and green values automatically .
in addition , you can set the white straight away with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available :
the over@@ sight of indi@@ k@@ ator increases the colors when more than one color @-@ channel of the Pix@@ els is over@@ exposed .. you will display the combined result in the white background . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture .
the buttons , as well as charging make this exactly this . each setting of the white de@@ cks you have set before you can save it into a text file and then load back .
the button pres@@ et sets all filter values back to their standard values and the corresponding neutral white lock . note that also neutr@@ ale settings will be displayed as your original . if you save it , your original image will change .
you can set here the co@@ di@@ ver of the be@@ et@@ ched image . 8 @-@ bit co@@ ding is the widespread JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit co@@ ding is better suited for high quality pictures . however , this co@@ ding is also needed more graph@@ ing , calcul@@ ating time and is on@@ ent for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialogue as for the processing of raw materials . it uses the change and transfer of color prof@@ iling . color mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the bri@@ ghtness . a detailed guide to the use of color prof@@ iling , you can extract the chapter administration .
another important tool can be found in the menu under colors audio @-@ correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple shades at the same time . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always make the same mistake and therefore you will always find the same correction . you will find further information .
to correct a very powerful possibility of correct ble@@ ms , the tool for Grad@@ ation is that you can find under colors Grad@@ ation in the menu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; tool Far@@ be@@ ff@@ ective gives you four colour effects , a solar panel , a ne@@ on @-@ effect and a cant@@ en@@ filter at its disposal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of chemical processing , solar power , also Sab@@ ati@@ er referred to , an effect of the origin@@ ator was created by the additional light . this was the effect that the light @-@ light areas dar@@ ker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . the result was a part of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar power . at about 50 % intensity , the picture shows what chem@@ ically possible . a further increase is finally generated an neg@@ ativity that cannot be generated on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of solar energy efficiency . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the process ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vivi@@ d @-@ Filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ oth ; -@@ effect . it diff@@ ers from a s@@ ati@@ ation to make it a stronger contrac@@ ted effect that makes the colors brilliant and glow . try it simple , he emb@@ ell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the trademark name for a day@@ light added color film created by the Japanese company F@@ UJ@@ IF@@ IL@@ M . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ oth ; and with it a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color , but as well as a reference for nature photographers . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly complex colors are but also some photo graph@@ s , especially those who barely cover landscapes , too much .
the Ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates Ne@@ on@@ light on the contra@@ sts . the parameter levels controls the bri@@ ghtness of the result and the sli@@ der repe@@ ats the strength of the ne@@ on . with large images , the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common to correct the color @-@ tr@@ ash and the lumin@@ ance of the photo . you can view the experiment with the different color blocks of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you can get a photo in bad light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : one too big satur@@ ation . even in this case , the tool for bri@@ ghtness is a good choice to increase s@@ ati@@ ation instead of increasing . all changes you can perform in the preview . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool Grad@@ ation and the simple lamp @-@ strength / contr@@ ast / g@@ amma is the tool sound correction to improve the exposure . also , if the dialog based on this tool is very complicated , you need to explain the area of the sli@@ der . concrete the three Sch@@ ie@@ ber below the Histor@@ ic Program .
the window provides a graph@@ s of the int@@ ens@@ ability , a hist@@ o@@ grams , of active se@@ wer or selected en@@ closures . under the graph@@ s are three sc@@ ents to be cli@@ cked and which can be moved to change the voic@@ ing values of the picture . the left side represents the dark ones and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to post@@ p@@ one the Reg@@ ulators and take care of how the image changes .
on the right , the original and preview of the picture can be seen . the preview is dynamic , updated with the settings of the picture , updated . on the left side are the following options available .
sc@@ aling : with this sel@@ box can be adjusted , whether the hist@@ o@@ gram is depic@@ ted with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for pictures the large areas of a constant color includes the linear hist@@ o@@ grams is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic version is useful .
three Reg@@ ulators : the top for the dark T@@ ones , the middle for the bright sounds and the lowest for the middle @-@ notes , often called gam@@ ma@@ marks .
the three colours can be used in Pre@@ viewing the original image , to automatically read@@ ed the input values of shadows , middle and light tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic alignment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two Reg@@ ulators used to change the output values Inter@@ active as with the input values , e.g. to create a hidden picture as a background to see while something else is seen in the background .
automatically : with this kno@@ b the image values will be automatically set depending on the intensity of the image .
save as and store : with these buttons , the values stored in the fil@@ esystem and later re@@ loaded , the Gimp level is used .
if you use this mode and the three colours will use the input values automatically for all the shade , means and Sundays . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image for the press , green , blue , and the L@@ umin@@ ous channels .
the over@@ exposed indi@@ k@@ ator controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixel and you can display the combined result of all channels . this is a indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect in the final result .
below you see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left side the half of the original and the target can be displayed . the preview will be dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available :
modifications : this sel@@ box allows it to enter the channel which is modified by the module :
besides this cas@@ ket , two symbols will change between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures that are captured using a digital camera , linear mode creates a broad beam . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode will help with the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode .
if you move for example a short @-@ board to the right , for example the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds can be corresponding with dar@@ ker output and that the image image becomes dar@@ ker .
at the preview of the original photos is a red mark@@ er to see . if you want to change this mark@@ ings on the corner you want to adjust is a suitable line on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it and down until the value is aligned according to your taste .
save as and store : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . each bend that you created can now be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded . the file format is The Gimp Short format .
if you create this method and the three colours of the curve automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , middle and Sundays . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the check@@ points for the red , green , blue , and L@@ umin@@ ous cur@@ ve .
the over@@ exposed indi@@ k@@ ator controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixel . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixel , you get the combined result displayed . here it is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect in the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ white photo , which was corrected in L@@ umin@@ anz@@ kan@@ al . Sch@@ atten@@ - and Sundays was set with the color menu and applied to the cur@@ ves . the original image is ( 1 ) and corrected ( 2 ) .
the canal @-@ bl@@ ender of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; picture processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the color grad@@ ations of the photos .
the channel mix@@ er is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of images . you can edit it from the menu color channel bl@@ ender of the editing editing .
with the channel box you can select the color for the hist@@ o@@ grams : this gives you a first reference as you can correct the channels by clicking the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be seen as a comparison with your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the picture a vertical line in hist@@ o@@ grams will display the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are right below : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to blend these channels . this is particularly useful when you can also change the corresponding paint components , as the channel mix@@ er then DAS tool for generating great black con@@ versions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , the reduction of a color comes to a visible sound , which does not occur at the same point in the shade of color and whose spatial patterns look different from each channel . if that &apos;s the case , you can improve your Mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me and improve it in which you reduce the color .
the stor@@ ks as well as loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting can save you for later and then load . used file format is the Gimp channel Mix@@ er format .
the over@@ exposed indi@@ k@@ ator controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixel and you can display the combined result of all channels . this is a indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect in the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been read@@ just@@ ed . the L@@ umin@@ ancy option is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the image was shown below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your level of abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a shift , since color pictures can be easily converted to the computer . even with a set of film profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white fil@@ tration with a green Lin@@ sen@@ filter . this looks good at all scenarios and fits especially well with portraits against the sky . thus similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) GrÃ¼n@@ filter .
Oran@@ ges : simul@@ ated a black / white fil@@ tering filter with a orange Lin@@ sen@@ filter . this increases landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . thus similar to 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ ge@@ il@@ ter .

with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; tool texture uses you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
by adding a texture to your image , whether it is a color picture or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the Sti@@ ch of an old master , a pop Art portrait out of enlarged points or as a wall picture on a wall . the menu entry image texture uses the image processing can be used for this .
relief : move this parameter to the right raises the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture in the picture .
a paper Tex@@ ture@@ f@@ ekt has been applied to the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the parameters relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of a be@@ holder in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative element . this is a psychological barrier to the stre@@ aking eye . under the picture frame the module can be started from the image processing .
type : with this parameter you set the desired cream type for your image . therefore , the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce embr@@ aces it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal for a bone @-@ effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : specify width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
that with the frame decorative picture will be bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing images , especially if you have used the tool after si@@ p ratio .
with this practical tool you can insert simple a form@@ att@@ ed text into an image at any place . this also goes to several places when you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with your mouse . use text device , orientation , color from the color tree and the character set with its characteristics as you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ sigh@@ ted background . already , the image is ready .
any adjustment that you have chosen for your text may be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; after the picture once was saved , the text is part of the picture . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; tool for sale you can put an option over a picture .
the menu image to apply in picture editing can be used to create more than one picture .
for the Stencil there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . however , if you want to add the PNG file format and should add with maximum comp@@ ression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the Stencil , just send an e @-@ mail in English at the &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; mail@@ ing@@ liste di@@ gi@@ came @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for first time , you need to put your sten@@ cil buttons with the button base folder . select the folder in which you have copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings are marked for the next start .
once the root folder has been set for the sten@@ cils , appears to be a building management that reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder . the selection of a folder updated the pre@@ text of the sten@@ cils automatically .
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fier factor and position of your image .
enlarge : this button is enlarged , the opposite picture . it is cent@@ red around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
crus@@ hing the underlying image . it is arranged around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to enlarge the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move this button to post@@ p@@ one the image below the Stencil below . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then automatically be adapted to the viewing size .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; three different tool at your disposal . each one of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but especially in dark areas , gran@@ ting images .
un@@ shar@@ p@@ able mas@@ ke works on the contrast of the edges by an image shar@@ per . in fact , it works rather psych@@ ov@@ is@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmosph@@ eric man@@ sions and it &apos;s doing here a really good job . the algorith@@ m was taken out of Gimp and it is protected by copyright from W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
re@@ loc@@ ating is possibly the best of the three because it really enh@@ ances the shar@@ p@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adjust .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images need a correction of shar@@ p@@ ness . these elements are smaller than the resolution are becoming a common color . the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras usually need more det@@ ri@@ mental scar@@ ing as normal cameras for the private user .
in JPEG @-@ images it is often applied to a camera internal sli@@ ding . pictures in the raw @-@ format , on the other hand , must always be stored during the processing .
some sc@@ ann@@ ers apply a shar@@ pen@@ er already during the reading of the picture . if you dis@@ able this , you get in control of your image .
in some situations you can obtain read@@ able results by bl@@ ur a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing pro@@ voc@@ als . you can call with the software application Cor@@ rigi@@ d shar@@ pen@@ ing .
you should therefore deal with caution because the results are not very natural : the shar@@ pen@@ ing increases the shar@@ p@@ ness of edges , but also intensi@@ fies the noise . in general , the needed technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing a picture is the tool re@@ loc@@ ating . you can find it on the menu entry Cor@@ re@@ viewer . taking a refund , you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it is tough@@ er . use the tool for soft@@ ens with the menu item Cor@@ rigi@@ d Cor@@ so@@ fter and experiment with you something with settings . the pres@@ um@@ er@@ sion on the right of the dialogue will show you the effect on your photo .
the filter bl@@ ur mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove s@@ eils of your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview can help edit the image . the showcase shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , radius and amount . the standard values often produce good results and should first try the effect . an increase in radius or the amount will reinforce the effect . if you create the un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness mask , ru@@ ff@@ les and the impression of fr@@ y are getting close by sharp edges .
the radius represents how many pixels are affected by the filter on each side of a can@@ te . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ os . therefore , images are best shar@@ pen@@ ed in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage being added between the original and the simpli@@ fied image of the original one . thus , the strength of shar@@ p@@ ness is set .
the sw@@ elling is a fraction of the maximum R@@ GB value and the applicable difference . one can thus define a minimum difference in order for a channel of filters . in this way areas with a soft switch between the killing , and therefore SchÃ¶n@@ heits@@ bug in faces , cel@@ and@@ les and water surfaces .
this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the working picture ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ cot was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and one thres@@ hold = 0.0 .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; tool re@@ loc@@ ating re@@ loc@@ ates a picture by enhancing the shar@@ p@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted un@@ protected un@@ folding filter @-@ algorith@@ m of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to create an image &amp; quot ; ref@@ ok@@ ussi@@ an quot ; in which it makes a better approach than just trying to raise the photo . re@@ focus usually reaches better results as un@@ sharp mas@@ king . you can start it from the menu by re@@ voke colors Ref@@ ok@@ ussi@@ onist in picture editing .
in practice the circular circuit works much better than the Gau@@ Ã &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung . the Gau@@ Ã &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung has a very long tail , which depends far from the original pixel . the FI@@ R Wiener In@@ verse of the Gau@@ Ã &apos;s F@@ altung is even affected very strongly from the remote pixels . the causes of unwanted results .
circular shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the radius of circular cutting . it is the main parameter to use this module . for most images it should be the default value 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image should be very bl@@ ur@@ red , but should be careful on virgin .
cor@@ relation : a raise of the cor@@ relation can help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the cor@@ relation can be chosen by 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values nearby 1 , &amp; eg ; maintain and cut@@ . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the shar@@ p@@ tive effect of the module .
smoking filter : an increase in the smoke filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 but rarely helpful . if the smoke filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a usable value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value is even further poll@@ uted .
gau@@ dy &apos;s shar@@ pen@@ ing : this is the radius for the Gau@@ Ã &apos;@@ sche Sch@@ Ã¤r@@ fe . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value in@@ equal to zero , you may also need to increase the cor@@ relation and / or the smoke filter .
die @-@ Size : this value determines the size of the trans@@ ation@@ sm@@ atri@@ x . an increase of the die @-@ size can produce good results , especially if you choose great values for the circular shell or the Gau@@ Ã &apos;@@ schen Sch@@ Ã¤r@@ fe . however , however , that the module will be very slow if you choose great value for these parameters . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the stor@@ ks as well as loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ loc@@ ating parameter which you have set will be stored for later and can then be loaded .
try all the cuts , color and int@@ ens@@ ability to perform in the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but left out un@@ pleasant art@@ ef@@ acts .
if you read images and comp@@ ress , eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ comp@@ ressed picture .
generally producing bl@@ ur@@ red masks for better results as shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by being the bl@@ ur mas@@ king into a larger neighborhood as shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theoretically , I have to bl@@ ur bl@@ ur@@ red masks always produce art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it is never possible to remove the effect of the shar@@ p@@ ness . virtually is the result of FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ters at least as good as the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed mask . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is often better in treating small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small un@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed image :
the original un@@ sharp color picture has to be corrected ; this picture was done with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to an insufficient light for the Auto @-@ focus liner .
for more information on the installation correction of digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the Reg@@ ler Gl@@ Ã¤t@@ te sets the un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of the sp@@ ears of the dark , in order to generate a natural p@@ up@@ glasses .
the color @-@ tin@@ te allows a adapted color for the P@@ up@@ glasses . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set it here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tool to remove the desired type of art@@ ef@@ acts with an unprecedented speed .
the In@@ dus algorith@@ m was developed by the I@@ MAGE Team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as star@@ points to simplify the restoration . the options available are listed below :
if you want to adjust the fil@@ tering orders , you can use the rider Gl@@ et@@ ing and advanced settings .
detail@@ ing p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of details . a small value leads to a moderate bal@@ u@@ ity . a value of 0,9 should be sharp . a value of 0,9 should give details so that no shar@@ pen@@ ing is necessary . please note that the detailed position should always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated to the ad@@ diction of depen@@ dency .
stra@@ e@@ ad@@ diction Alpha &#91; 0.@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es even@@ ly in all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you create a movie gran@@ ularity or C@@ CD rou@@ ches will generate a high value wave @-@ similar pattern . JPEG arti@@ facts are best done at a value close to 1 .
smooth@@ ing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all@@ es. p defines the relative smooth@@ ness . therefore , put this value appropriate to the level of smoking in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is difficult , since it &apos;s difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s tur@@ mo@@ il effect it has to be higher than 3 .
repet@@ itions : indicates as often the algorith@@ m is running . normally , here 1 or 2 .
Winkel@@ ho@@ es da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : mental lic integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if Alpha has chosen to be small , so that little angle should generate a long term . therefore , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs .
integral sound@@ ing range &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral sound@@ ing in pixels . you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid Sub @-@ Pixel @-@ smooth@@ ing and never bigger than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the Higher quality that you receive by choice of this option is only low . it dou@@ bles but the run@@ time . we recommend it to permit it .
the buttons as well as charging make this exactly this . any adjustment of image errors can now be saved into a text file and later re@@ loaded .
the error correct is compar@@ atively very quick at work . however , it can still be very long and a high CPU load can be drawn . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b off .
below you can see like a mistake with small art@@ ef@@ acts may be corrected ; the module is applied to a photo that is being done in Guatemala City with an an@@ alogue camera . as you see there is a peculi@@ ar black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreground , that caused by a poor film@@ making during the journey is caused by ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; smoking @-@ reduction is a very powerful tool to l@@ essen images . it uses an copy@@ righ@@ ted algorith@@ m by Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
this tool presents sel@@ ectable image filter to remove st@@ ains and other arti@@ facts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sens@@ ations from the camera or mo@@ i@@ y@@ man ; the effects of sc@@ ann@@ ed images from books or magazines .
if you need further information on sensor bol@@ ts from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screens@@ hot picture above shows a typical scene that has been done with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ting noise which can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings may remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the amount of filters per pixel and can termin@@ ate the image . through the radius opposite the image and color in it is cle@@ ared and thus small bugs .
shar@@ p@@ ness : controls the pix@@ el@@ f@@ ep@@ e@@ gel . this value puts the pix@@ el@@ event@@ ual changes . if it is raised , smoking filter will rest@@ ores . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filters picture details can no longer be preserved and cat@@ ching or lubric@@ ate .
edges : controls the appropriate imp@@ rec@@ ision for the shar@@ p@@ ness . this value increases the frequency response of the filter . if it &apos;s too strong can not occur the whole rough or smoking points can occur . put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a f@@ rail or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the illumin@@ ance of the picture . we recommend you to either change color or lumin@@ ance to change an image . these settings do not influence the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details -@@ settings .
color : controls the color @-@ toler@@ ance of the picture . we recommend you to either change color or lumin@@ ance to change an image . these settings do not influence the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details -@@ settings .
g@@ amma : controls the Gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ intoler@@ ance of the picture . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of the dar@@ ker areas , which typically cum@@ ber@@ ed more strongly . however , it is also contamin@@ ated the shadow areas .
shock absorption : controls the alignment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ it@@ ter@@ ste@@ ad@@ ation . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius will occur . if it &apos;s going to be high , can be a sound and phon@@ em@@ itter at the edges . he can remove debr@@ is and is the recommended method for it .
stor@@ ing and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for smoking @-@ reduction , which you have set can be saved into the fil@@ esystem and later loaded .
this is an example of how smoking reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and which corrected with ( 2 ) marked . the smok@@ reduction has been applied with the standard settings .
sometimes a picture is cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than an image . use this tool for soft@@ ens with the menu entry Cor@@ rigi@@ d . click the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; photo Rest@@ oration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to decrease electr@@ art@@ ef@@ acts .
these filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undes@@ irable art@@ ef@@ acts of your images . it is very well adapted to remove the gau@@ dy , sound@@ proof , scr@@ at@@ ching , comp@@ art@@ ef@@ art@@ ef@@ acts , and local errors which occurs in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ ised images emerge . the smooth@@ ing takes place along the images and thus receives the content as it also makes the human eye .
the same algorith@@ m can be used for color and tex@@ tur@@ bine . the algorith@@ m for restoration was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS lab@@ s in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : the comp@@ ression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas it is not perfect , in some areas , it generates some comp@@ ression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are in un@@ comp@@ ressed picture . this setting is intended to correct those problems .
the buttons as well as charging make this exactly this . any adjustment of photo restoration can now be saved into a text file and later re@@ loaded .
photo Rest@@ oration is compar@@ atively very quick at work . however , it can still be very long and a high CPU load tigh@@ tening . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b break down .
below you can reduce like a photo with like @-@ shaped ru@@ gs . the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie was recorded with a Sens@@ iti@@ vity by 3200 ISO . you can see the ring@@ ent movies on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and that corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo Rest@@ oration . this time , tex@@ tures has been reduced to an old color photo , which has been introduced with a scanner . you can see the scan speci@@ ation and the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; tool hot@@ text permits the text of photos taken with a C@@ CD camera , eight were to remove . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PEG@@ Pix@@ i project , protected by copyright from Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are particularly high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos a problem because many cameras with JPEG comp@@ ression including an built @-@ in op@@ ression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; the Pixel@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel ; on a photo with a dark tube method . there are currently no manual approach to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the assistant with the button dark . the tool becomes automatic to detect the hot and bright pixel . these are highlighted in the preview &apos;s preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important to capture the dark picture directly next to the new hot or bright pixel by C@@ CD Def@@ ective .
first , as described in the previous section , you should find the matching dark@@ image to the correc@@ ting picture . take note that the assistant will notice the last dark picture and this automatically re@@ charge this automatically within the next session .
the picture area and the preview can help you to correct the result within the picture . the pre @-@ showcase shows the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixels are taken up in all the preference areas .
select an area around the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter to see . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ish these pixel blocks . these are the available filters available :
Dur@@ ing : there is an average of the neighborhoods below . the color is assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels have drawn a distance of 1 of the pixel block , are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ lin@@ ear@@ en surface ( 2 @-@ DIM ) or a group of linear cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ DIM ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ish the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
square : this is the default method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block will be with@@ drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ DIM ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ DIM ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ish the pixels in the block .
cu@@ bic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are pulled to calculate a bi @-@ kub@@ ic surface ( 2 @-@ DIM ) or a group of cu@@ bic cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ DIM ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ish the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
below you can see the hot@@ text correction on a color photo , made of a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original picture was increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; Vign@@ et@@ ting @-@ Surgery is a tool to correct the Vign@@ et@@ ting , that is , to correct , sub@@ set corners , of an image .
fo@@ rest@@ ers objective , in particular the middle and large photo@@ graphic format , can frequently illumin@@ ate the entire sensor field . instead &amp; quot ; v@@ ign@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) them reduce the corners and r@@ ust of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there . telep@@ ath@@ ically manifest in circumstances also this behavior .
but he also has down@@ sides . many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 with the aper@@ ture filter , which is impossible to keep the camera with hand . wide @-@ angle objective should be used , also with Center filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller as otherwise un@@ tough@@ er effects caused by movement .
with the major si@@ pping areas of today &apos;s film and color scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a c@@ enter@@ piece by digital cameras and film scanner , the tool is applied with a c@@ enter@@ filter on a picture . the algorith@@ m is copy@@ righ@@ ted with a c@@ enter@@ filter on a picture . the algorith@@ m is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three controllers you can control the Vign@@ et@@ from @-@ filter and with three other expos@@ ing the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity setting at the point of the greatest density of the filter . the standard density is 2,@@ 0 , which is an optical filter with a bl@@ ending default from 1 , or acci@@ dentally of a light intensity of 2 , de@@ sp@@ ed you reduce the density to compens@@ ate for a greater degree of v@@ ign@@ ation .
Leu@@ ch@@ strength , contrast and g@@ amma @-@ settings : the fix@@ ing of an image with the Vign@@ et@@ ting of the pixels . you have to re @-@ adjust the exposure to the target image with these options . the Reg@@ ulators provide you only positive values , since you just need to increase the settings .
if you want a host@@ ile re@@ ign@@ ing of the target image , so let the values for illumin@@ ate / contrast / g@@ amma with zero and use the Grad@@ ation from the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; image processing from the menu color Grad@@ ation menu .
this is an example of the Vign@@ et@@ ting @-@ re@@ ktion on a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the Vign@@ et@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a lumin@@ ous and contrast @-@ correction was also carried out in the image with this tool .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; Lin@@ sen@@ dist@@ or@@ tion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses an copy@@ righ@@ ted algorith@@ m by David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric for@@ c@@ ings . color@@ less dist@@ or@@ tions can not be corrected using this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second Gr@@ ades treated the general geomet@@ rical dist@@ or@@ tion of the lens , and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ fine form of the image .
the co@@ efficient of the third Gr@@ ades has a similar tour effect , flat , but at edges . this correction is not applied to the tool .
the co@@ efficient fourth Gr@@ ades corrected the remote corners opposite to the second c@@ ades . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical dist@@ or@@ tion can be virtually eliminated .
generally speaking , this value determines the strength of the dist@@ or@@ tion second c@@ ades . with negative values , tons @-@ shaped dist@@ or@@ tions can be corrected and positive values are con@@ scientious obj@@ ections .
corner : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ or@@ tion fourth Gr@@ ades . this value acts more powerful in the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Cor@@ ners &apos; parameter has the revers@@ ed prot@@ ector of the parameter .
Zoom : this value escal@@ ating the image size and thus leads to correction first Gr@@ ades through . negative values increase while maintaining the image smaller .
bright : this value sti@@ pul@@ ates the bri@@ ghtness in the corners of the picture . negative values reduce the bri@@ ghtness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase .
to help you find the best fil@@ tering orders , the dialogue with a preview is the dist@@ or@@ tion connection . the values you use for your image will be stored and used in the next start@@ up as standard values .
the tonn@@ age or dis@@ rup@@ tly correction should be performed prior to all the fe@@ ver or size changes . in the best result , you perform this correction as all the first . if you perform an image or perform a tons of tons , the effect would be obvious .
to help you find the best correction to assist you to display this tool a vertical and horizontal separ@@ ating line . move it to an important place , such as the sea front or building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the tonn@@ ell@@ - / cooling @-@ shaped dist@@ or@@ tion with the help of the lines .
if you want to correct a con@@ scientious obj@@ ections , the resulting image black corner will have . you can transform it with the fe@@ ather @-@ tool in the menu trans@@ crop from the image processing or via the z@@ oom Reg@@ ler to remove this dialogue .
for most images the tons @-@ shaped correction consists of . the next logical step for some motives , such as shots of the front , frames and paintings , it is the perspective so correct that all angles in the picture 90 degrees . take note of it when you keep the camera with your hand you will always have a slight dist@@ or@@ tion of perspective .
this is an example of the tons @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorith@@ m is based on a method of simul@@ ating infr@@ ared camera of the G@@ imp@@ anz@@ u@@ .org web page which is accessible using this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ ar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a Sens@@ iti@@ v@@ ability of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you can post@@ p@@ one the red right click with the mouse you can see the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can adjust two parameters set fil@@ tration and film@@ sensitivity ( ISO ) . the ISO Reg@@ ler changes the amount of fil@@ tration and domin@@ ance of colour green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter colour channels used for re@@ produce infr@@ ared film , especially the green @-@ channel does not make sense the effect on black / white photos , because the colour form@@ ations are missing .
this is an example of infr@@ a @-@ fil@@ tered photo on a land photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the working picture under ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of au@@ ra in the l@@ edge .
der &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; Filter Film@@ gr@@ itt is a simple to use tool to re@@ produce movies on your images , such as the B / W K@@ od@@ ak Tri @-@ X , known to increase the sensitivity of movies , the manufacturers large silver bas@@ ins of the photo em@@ ul@@ sion .
the film turn@@ out effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . if you want this specific , gallery @-@ like , road @-@ like , gran@@ ular memory especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ men photos , so you have to use this filter .
with the Reg@@ ler the ISO @-@ sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ularity of the KÃ¶r@@ ner . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , adjusted to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more bas@@ ins , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of the film element print on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the one worked ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity is equal to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; Filter oil paintings produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorith@@ m from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; Filter oil paintings gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting . natural images and style live are good for this effect .
there are two Reg@@ ulators found in order to influence this effect . the above , the brush size between one and five out . thick@@ er brush are better suited for large images . smooth@@ es controls the smooth@@ ing or , from the other side the hin@@ it@@ fulness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 2 ) and this is marked with the ( 2 ) . Pin@@ sel@@ size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and Gl@@ Ã¤t@@ te 17 .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; filter coal drawing is used color and voic@@ ing gra@@ dient to generate a char@@ ge@@ tic in the drawing . therefore , pictures whose gra@@ dient are slowly changing and therefore are not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful if you choose to sket@@ ching the scene you would have chosen to sk@@ iz@@ ze yourself . these would be good pictures to begin with it .
there are two lines with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper Reg@@ ler select the pin size and the lower read@@ just@@ ed the contrast ( smooth@@ ing ) .
this is an example of the label filters . the original image ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be improved by adapting the intensity &apos;s value .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; Filter En@@ engra@@ ving your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was st@@ amp@@ ed in Wax , it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorith@@ m from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; Filter En@@ gra@@ ving is a fast tool to re@@ produce your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . he works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ th@@ dar@@ ily landscape .
the depth allows the contrast to the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , equivalent to 10 % , is the default .
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the depth used is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of dist@@ or@@ ative effects . it is used to copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and lets it look , as if it is seen through glass blocks .
wave 2 : an@@ alogue to the wav@@ es@@ ome 1 , the picture is dist@@ orted here in a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can break these effects anytime with the kno@@ b break down .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of un@@ shar@@ p@@ able effects . it uses the copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
Zoom Infin@@ ity : bl@@ ur@@ red the image along fine @-@ shaped lines that origin@@ ate from a center . this simul@@ ates the dis@@ shar@@ p@@ ness a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often in the sport photography .
radi@@ ale un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image by rotating the pixels at a center . this simul@@ ates the dis@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of a revol@@ ving camera .
removal : bl@@ ur@@ red the picture to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to come back into the background .
movement @-@ motion : bl@@ ur@@ red the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the dis@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of a linear movements , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing camera , camera .
soft@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image soft into the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and sh@@ iny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our photos , or add a warm and subtle glow .
Sag@@ ar@@ un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ny : bl@@ ur@@ red the image by random shift of the pixels and simul@@ ates through this the dis@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of a random move camera .
intelligent un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : finds the color @-@ bas@@ ins in the picture and wi@@ den it without the rest to change .
Mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it through the col@@ t with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the kno@@ b break .
the rain drops are a nice little tool to make rain drops in your image . thus , it gives natural your images a nice appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n re@@ inde@@ ted algorith@@ m .
dro@@ ple@@ t size allows to change the size of the tro@@ p . as the tro@@ user size does not occur automatically with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce size for small images . number changes the number and the density of drops . fish pressure changes the op@@ tic effect of the drop in the image .
you can use with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; picture editing a range from Reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ pfen . use the selection tool to set the area , for example a face , which should remain free . if you start the filter off , the area will remain free of rain drops .
this is an example of the book@@ case filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a peaceful sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
when the photo has the wrong orientation , you can get it by mirror or turning into the right orientation . the tools can be trans@@ figured in the menu and transform them into the menu .
photo inflatable is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a picture in a minimum loss of image quality .
a picture to enlarge is simple . the big question is how can you find an image bub@@ ble and the details are sharp ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you see the missing information here ? try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can change it on the desired size with the tool size . choose to change size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below .
the tool to change size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation@@ method to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool for inflatable .
many educational programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . and used a further developed approach . the underlying algorith@@ m photo inflatable photo was developed by the I@@ MAGE Team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g Project .
you must tell the tool like you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below :
one aspect ratio is kept : if this setting is activated , the entry of the new size is maintained to the original ratio of its original image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects bigger structures . the higher the value is set , the more it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s tur@@ mo@@ il effect it has to be higher than 3 .
the buttons , as well as charging can be used exactly in the same way . any plug @-@ in for photo can be saved as a text file , and later re@@ loaded .
photo inflatable is very quick in what it makes , but it can still last very long and draw a high CPU load safely . you can break the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b break down .
you can see below an example of photo inflatable by adding a small color picture to double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the Pre@@ view ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard Aug@@ mentation on the comparison .
the cutting of a photo is not only a commonly performed surgery , but also a commonly under@@ estimated tool to compile an image . in order to create a picture with mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag the rectang@@ le , create . you will then see this right after you move the mouse .
when you run the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut down . this will give you a good overview of your photo after the cutting area . you can drag the size of the cutting area by drag on the corners of the rectang@@ le . a new rectang@@ le create you by simply drag it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting @-@ section , use the button &quot; Acc@@ ru@@ de button of picture processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is custom@@ iz@@ able ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file stor@@ ing or file stor@@ ing under the menu file to save the newly built photo .
in the fore@@ field , you can change the size of the rectang@@ le by move the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio which you have defined in dialogue will be retained .
in the tool After side@@ ways , you can specify the orientation as a high format or cross @-@ format . in the high format is always the greater value of height and in the cross @-@ format of the width .
the tool After side@@ ways is using a relative page ratio . this means that it &apos;s always the same , regardless of whether you are using inches , inch or any other physical size . you can see e.g. below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their side @-@ ratio .
at the right end of the dialogue , there are two buttons for the selection automatically horizontal or ver@@ tically .
below in dialogue you can set up with the Max . relation to the area to the cutting on the greatest possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation .
the tool After sides ratio stores its settings depending on the orientation ( Horiz@@ ontal or Vertical ) . if you are using the cutting tool , these settings will be stored as default values depending on the orientation . the modified images are reflected in the EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data are reflected to the cro@@ pped image and not the original image .
the settings of the composition aid allow assistance to be involved , so that you can better compos@@ e your pictures .
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ thirds , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a possibility of sharing a rectang@@ le in similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles on the di@@ agon@@ als .
golden middle : the golden middle is a division that is on different natural growth pattern , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us pussy , or the bl@@ acks of a sun@@ flower . it emerg@@ es in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the ir@@ ration@@ ale number of 1,6@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was already used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks , so that their tem@@ ples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your images , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i as a result of 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . at the present divi@@ der is 1 : 1,6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that is usually follows as vis@@ ually harmon@@ ious .
the golden centre represents liquid aid @-@ lines available when you put an image . these aids are recorded below :
the Golden Spir@@ ale will bring you closer to your goal for your photos . compared to the third party , the Golden Spir@@ ale produces a liquid line of the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the eye of the spect@@ ator along the line of the spiral and creates a balanced visual flow .
another rule is the rectang@@ le of golden spiral , also called golden frame . it should give something that the eye at the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . this something can simply be there without the eye , it will fulfil its task .
the golden tri@@ angles also lead from the above mentioned golden bow@@ ls . take note of this , which in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equ@@ ali@@ zz@@ ling tri@@ angles . di@@ agonal to these lines can be placed a static object dynam@@ ically appeared .
if you use golden tri@@ angles in order to break your frame , create an effect of using professional photo graph@@ s dynamic Sym@@ met@@ ry . try your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information into the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach any other way .
the options Horiz@@ ontal and Vertical can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic particles .
with the kno@@ b , you can set the colour of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the help lines can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines of your current image .
the Free Rot@@ ation is a tool to turn a picture to any angle .
if you make a photo , it happens easily that you are not exactly ver@@ tically or horizontal . this produces a picture where things came around a angle . you can repair this with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; picture processing and the tool free rotation . choose to transform it free and adjust the target angle .
turn your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are stated in degrees . with the kno@@ bs you can put the sli@@ der on the right side of the window . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right top .
for your help the module Free Rot@@ ation provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor to position the two lines . after you move it over an important point of the picture , you can set it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now you adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you shot an image , you will find unwanted holes in the corners . a way to fix it is the function transform@@ ate to use from picture editing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the automatic cutting . select one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing the image a bit after the rotation . however , take note of the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tive transform@@ ations are performed to a fix@@ ture on the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your picture . the preview is then automatically calculated . on the right of the dialogue , you will find some information which help you to change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas that are created through the transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas that are created through the transformation , in pixels .
angle on the top left : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed territory .
angle on the top : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed territory .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed territory .
angle right below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed territory .
after adapting the perspective the picture becomes a bit dirty . for a single adaptation this effect is small , but two adjustments create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you adapted the perspective you get unwanted tri@@ ang@@ ular holes in the corners . a way of ber@@ some it is the picture to transform it from the image editing .
the tool @-@ tool is used to post@@ p@@ one part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite . this is not a rotation , the image is dist@@ orted . with other words , a rectang@@ le is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogra@@ m . you can transform this module via transforming she@@ ar .
configure your image by using the horizon and vertical angle . you can press horizontal and ver@@ tically at the same time . if you press on preference , the angle will be displayed at zero . a preview of the effect is displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the show@@ room .
at your help is a vertical and a horizontal line appears . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the pattern hair to adjust your image .
after you carried out the she@@ ar , the picture gets a bit bl@@ ur@@ red . for a single switching , this effect is generally neg@@ li@@ gible , but two lock@@ ers might become twice as much s@@ wis@@ s and therefore you should avoid this .
after che@@ ating , the image has an un@@ beautiful tri@@ ang@@ ular holes in the corners . a way to remove it is the picture to transform it from the image editing .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; you need a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries comp@@ lies . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ;
due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on its system . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF below .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; shows only files in formats that knows . if the extension is listed in the list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can edit this list of file editing . you can modify this list of file editing . in the section configuration you will find more information .
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format . a detailed description of this file formats you can find in Wikipedia . &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; supports both formats .
picture comp@@ ression is the application of data comp@@ ression to digital pictures . you will be red@@ und@@ ant information to save in this way the image data on an efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other results as JPEG in the same composition . the 2000 version can also be dis@@ able , if it is stated in the settings .
if you want to find out more about the raw format , you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Col@@ our very helpful coun@@ sel@@ ector in English . you can easily convert raw format images in JPEG or TI@@ FF . in the section configuration you will find further information about using modules with &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ;
&amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; supports the store of raw materials only supported with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which in &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; it is hereby to support cameras at the web page of Dave coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw materials that came from &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; supported :
many digital cameras support the intake of short films . these clips are often saved in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG @-@ format ; however , if you want to click on a movie file , it is not a film editor and therefore does not have a movie file ; you can use movies to play movies to play the program to play .

if you change the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four stick@@ ers with the module white .
many tools that you require the photo@@ editing you need in &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; contain your description below .
all image processing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , soft@@ ness , smoke @-@ supp@@ ression , pun@@ ctu@@ ally mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type which is applied to the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current picture . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture user @-@ quot ; in this dialogue :
( 1 ) : this progress shows the status of the filter on the current picture . left of him allow five buttons to change the compar@@ ative mode of the curtain @-@ area . these modes are :
ver@@ tically sharing without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area right of the selected lecture area .
horizont@@ ally share without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the range below the selected point of view .
ver@@ tically share . the left area shows the original and the right for the effect of the filter .
horizont@@ ally share . the upper area shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .

&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a KDE program for the considering of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science . until now , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; programs to visu@@ alize graph@@ s . the programs , die &amp; Graphics ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; project has set itself to replace these programmes by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphic interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program to replace the program .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a KDE program for the considering of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graph@@ s . the &amp; graphic viewer ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; displays graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; to . it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; Kate ; and &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; the graph@@ s is calculated and in &amp; c@@ graph@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; open the graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; in a &amp; Kate ; -@@ component to open
load big graph@@ s ( currently there are problems of about 1000 knot@@ s and one h@@ ack to show more than this no@@ des )
additional required software : &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program , which requires the &amp; Graphics ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graph@@ s are required in detail :
the main window shows the mag@@ net graph@@ s , every one in its own window . at the beginning , when you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer , the main window stops just like in the bottom screens@@ hot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file and the ( blank ) list opened files . click on the first symbol to open the dialog file .
once you have selected one or more &amp; dot , the main window looks like in the bottom screens@@ hot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is bigger than the character surface . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu , or allow this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and r@@ unter without special ta@@ vern@@ s , left and right at pressing &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ;
zo@@ oming is restricted in both directions by the factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph@@ s .
when the file is viewed in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer , loaded file from another program , the following window is displayed :
you can choose whether the graphic is to be re@@ loaded or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ ick@@ viewer will make your decision also notice , so that later also . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item settings k@@ graphical viewer ; direct , see also .
if you open a graph@@ end@@ at@@ ei outside a running &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; for instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; the instance will want to open or the graph@@ s graph@@ s in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option you can store your choice permanently , but it will also change with the setup dialog .
when you start the program you can open all the graph@@ s of your final meeting again . again , you can save your choice both and later .
you can also define how the graphic is to be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sites can be freely chosen .
if you use multiple sites , you can choose whether the parts of the graph@@ s are to come to this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out from the respective parts of the graph@@ s .
page preview with one on several pages graph@@ s without head@@ line and with another font
the site again provides the possibility to set the behavior if a file has been changed on the hard disk , eg . by another program . you can set a standard behaviour ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) or the program each time .
the site opens the possibility to set the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; you can specify a default behavior for this case ( the graph@@ s in a new window ) or determine that each time is asked .
the site administration administration gives the possibility to set the start @-@ behavior of &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; you can set a standard behaviour ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine whether to be asked for each start .
the context menu , which usually appears when you click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; you will open further options :
here you can select at different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ lay@@ out@@ algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; Graphics , are :
&amp; dot ; -@@ algorith@@ m , the standard for stra@@ igh@@ tened graph@@ s . it manufac@@ tures hierarch@@ ical or historical represent@@ ations . the algorith@@ m lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tried to produce as short edges and as few cant@@ ata .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; -@@ algorith@@ m is the default for un@@ specified graph@@ s . it is produced according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . it is used for Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i @-@ algorith@@ m , which is syn@@ onymous with stati@@ stically multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .

the K@@ IP@@ I module images submit provides tools to read new images and to save them .
this module can be used to record new images from external sources and canc@@ ers . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to reading images from a scanner which supported by the SAN@@ E project or a different source like video streams . that &apos;s how this works you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and SAN@@ E .
if you scan the menu item scan , a dialog , which allows you to select between all available sources on your computer . choose the source of which you want to fetch the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears that you can replace the pre@@ defined standard version sil@@ cr@@ he lets you select your image accordingly . check the image below and adjust the area to your needs . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , bottom corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
be sure that the window will be displayed completely , since some settings may not be displayed at any time .
once you have pushed the button scanning , you have to wait until the scan concluded and the window indicates the fix@@ ing of the options of the target image . here you can choose the comp@@ ression and type of image file . you also need to select the comp@@ ression and type of image file . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or set the image stored .
screen photos can you generate after you have selected in the menu Im@@ porting - &gt; screens@@ hot ... a window appears in which you can adjust the various screens@@ hot of the screens@@ hot :
select the complete work space to read a single window under the mouse .
if all of your own program window will be chosen will disappear , so that you can see other scre@@ ens and windows . otherwise , you will read following a short delay , the currently visible work place . if you have selected the complete desktop reading only the window under the mouse is read .
the delay decided how long screen photo will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work@@ space , you should select this delay high enough to navigate the time there .
once the screens@@ hot is made , the dialog options of the target image with the already described options above .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows the GPS coordinates in the met@@ adata of an image to add and edit . the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF Con@@ duc@@ ted of the image and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alisation provides tools at the disposal of images geograph@@ ically at spher@@ ical coordinate system , which is used by GPS and Galil@@ eo , to locate . height , long@@ itu@@ dinal and long@@ itu@@ dinal are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data to cor@@ relate a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ px @-@ format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert the data to you from your GPS device .
picture Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can bring a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the top to visual dialogue then appears . to load a trace ratio with G@@ P@@ X file , you need to load a trace file with G@@ P@@ X file . this file also contains data at the same time at the same places as the images of your camera .
if the file is loaded a automatic cor@@ relation that displays the coordinates in red . GPS Track data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore needs to be calculated with the GMT . this can be done with time zone . click here your camera @-@ zone .
the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives a upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera . lies the devi@@ ation below , the data are gathered together . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from one place , you can manually edit the g@@ px file and add to the pictures . the difference between 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all pictures in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ling and difference in min can be used if you do not have appropriate data . if you know that in reality , a locality in a large time difference between camera and GPS is , you can put these boundaries here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ling .
the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same place . as the dialogue will use the coordinates of a call to the next you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the loc@@ ating can also be found and set with the displayed card and enlarge . select it again and again through until you have achieved a far @-@ reaching accuracy . the amount must always be selected manually . the card can be swit@@ ched between card mode , satellite TV and a mixed mode .
completely outside the IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the ex@@ if@@ tool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .

the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow .
the MPEG @-@ panel module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , convert . this module uses packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also insert a base form . you can also add an audio file at MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slides .
all pictures are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can create a background color for the slideshow . with this module , it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you first need to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . after that , you can start using extras MPEG @-@ ash@@ au .
the images selected by you are then listed under Bild@@ files in Portfolio . there , you can also change the images or the content of the list .
once you are satisfied with your list , you should custom@@ ize the other settings . video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to select the corresponding TV standard PAL , Sec@@ tor or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and probably the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds which is displayed a picture . the speed of the screen will be defined as a low value creates a very sudden image change .
the background color can be set next . in doubt you should let them black . the name and the path of the created file can set you under name of MPEG @-@ output file . keep in mind as possible .
if you specify a audio file under the name of the audio source file , this will be integrated into the film . after you can adjust all settings to your preferences , you can get a coffee with the button . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now drink a cup of coffee and enjoy the slides when you &apos;re back .
if an indication appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages to the right settings right below .
the printing coach allows several images to print on a piece of paper together into standard Photo@@ sizes . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve you or using the Gimp module to direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import your in raw format stored pictures in one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command lines by Dave Coff@@ in . a original quot@@ ation from Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it creates the same results as the software from your camera body . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the raw file that is to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w @-@ Bild@@ converted window appears in the mode for a single image . with the button preview you can preview the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option will decide whether the camera settings can be used for the white pin . the essential parameters such as g@@ amma , bri@@ ghtness and red / Blue ampli@@ fier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG Con@@ version can be selected to allow you to use contrac@@ ted information . if your camera is working in R@@ GB mode the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion results . the fil@@ ename remains the same and just the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG used a ver@@ bal algorith@@ m and produces for the smallest file sizes .
the Tagged Image Format , TI@@ FF , maintains all the information of your image and uses the los@@ sy LZ@@ W comp@@ ression .
in case you prefer to edit your images frequently or you later prefer to use later on , you should not choose the JPEG format as there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteri@@ or@@ ated . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to retain the original data .
if you select JPEG as storage format , the met@@ adata present in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the file @-@ if information .
if you have adapted your settings you can start with the execute button , start the conversion . if you want to break this process then you can use it .
the for@@ kli@@ ft work@@ load allows you to convert multiple images to one time . use this mode therefore if you &apos;re safe , e.g. by testing to a single image , which are the best settings .
the options available are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , you have the option to automatically re@@ sign the existing file . however , this is not available . however , a preview is not available . the progress shows how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following picture formats are supported :
this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and tim@@ est@@ amps which should be used .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a image collection . it used to enlarge the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can enlarge the image size :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to custom@@ ize your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not propor@@ tion@@ ate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed by this option .
printing preparation : prepare the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge @-@ size and background colour , is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the required pictures beforehand . further pictures can be taken on the list of the images below .
after which you have started the module will pop up the image window with the images you select . over the button images can add you with a file @-@ selection dialog to add additional pictures . for the last one chosen picture the preview is displayed on the right side .
you can also drag images to the picture list and drop it down to add the list of images below .
with the kno@@ b pictures you will remove the selected images from the list of the images below .
once you have selected all the images you can click with the button OK the new message window of your e @-@ mail client . you only have to add the addresses and the subject area . the pictures selected are attached to you as an app@@ endi@@ x .
don &apos;t pay attention to many images at once . most email accounts have limitations for the size of the e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window will be used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and once again used until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field .
if you use the Google Mail service , you need to install the G@@ mailbox on your computer before . you can download this here .
after the selection of comments in a attached file you will add comments to the pictures into a text file and the mail attached .
the PNG format under the menu file file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo@@ graphic files such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality will not be changed . otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG under photos file format and the original files in the JPEG format are , then the original Ex@@ if@@ s are added to the detailed pictures .
if the process is finished , the window will not automatically closed down the status of status , in search of errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will be automatically started at the end . with the button closing , you can read this window ? en .
after launching the module Fort@@ gesch@@ ritt@@ ene Di@@ asch@@ au appears a window with questions like you want to have your slideshow . you can choose between the album selected and all the photographs of the album .
the API OpenGL trans@@ itions in the presentation are activated very elegant image trans@@ itions via OpenGL . you do not have to possess an appropriate graphics card since otherwise the slideshow is very slow .
the fil@@ en@@ ames option ensures that the fil@@ ename of the pictures are displayed in the left lower corner during the presentation .
the loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an end loop . you can then switch it manually with Es@@ c .
the option images by chance select is that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used in order of the pictures in the album .
under delay between the images the temporary distance between the individual images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should test it before you presentation your friends !
there is more than a dozen transition effects that you can choose . acci@@ dentally , choosing a different effect in any transition between the images .
during the Di@@ asch@@ au you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left side of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to switch it off .
with this tool@@ bar you can keep the presentation and start again , jump to the previous one and the next picture and stop the di@@ asch@@ au .
at the left of the screen , you can see the current date stream , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date read@@ just@@ ly currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imag@@ ing @ k@@ de@@ .org. Res@@ ellers : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module wall@@ paper is a tool to set an image as a background image for the working space .
this module requires the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as a background for your KDE @-@ working space .
once you have equipped your images and videos with editorial notes , you can see with &amp; k@@ photographer , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , are now available in any group , so in persons , places and in group keywords entries .
in the browser window you see the categories that you have provided information as you have provided your pictures and videos featuring comments . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current pre@@ viewer . in the following each one is described for himself .
when you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser is changing . see picture .
if you select another person only the images are displayed on which both people are visible . through this selection method , you can restrict the number of images seen from a few thousand images to some single images .
if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view the photo images to look at the images of your business .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can store with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can store your own image , This also applies to places , keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself . see the image .
to view images beside the names , select the button which view right outside on the tool@@ bar . please note that you can view the view for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can display e.g. symbols with pictures of people and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have any suitable pictures for your keywords ) .
however , you must choose which image should be displayed for each individual person . in order to display this , you need to display the image slideshow window ( in near@@ er described ) and select the image for the appropriate person . in the pop @-@ window you can adjust the magni@@ fier factor according to your needs and thus choose which part of the picture is displayed or be cut off .
if you open the entry to the entry in the main window , you will see a dialog , which is very similar to the dialog for fix@@ ing the image properties . this dialog allows you to look at the picture once again .
if you enter a strings in the field log or description , the sign@@ ments and descriptions of images are sear@@ ched for this text ; i.e. the date can be either part of the total date , i.e. for example , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as in 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images by certain names , as you can see in the picture . here , according to pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are shown .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you do not like to read hand@@ books , instead you prefer to try the functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and have a look at the quick entry to the screen photos and the latest videos .
launch &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select in the first dialog the demo , if you started &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu item using the menu tool . then some example will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ nu@@ album ; try .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a co@@ hesive HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ nu@@ album ; take a look at the tim@@ eline . a picture of this glue you can see here : . as the name suggests , this glue shows you data statistics about the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can show you several different tim@@ eline . each glue then displays a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . in the picture you see a portion of a database by showing the cor@@ b@@ ust only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline you can use in the following ways : you can preview the displayed entries file from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date displayed in the preview feature ) and also displays the tim@@ eline always the current date from the moment shown , if you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select an area of tim@@ eline by pressing the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ eline . if you select a range , you &apos;ll be able to ab@@ ort the choice only images of this period . you can ab@@ ort the selection by clicking on a beam of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; introduces you two options to create HTML websites with your images . the one is integrated into &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other as module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user &apos;s manual , the integrated version is described above , you can create HTML on the menu file ...
before HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and destination . in the following , each section is described more exactly .
first enter the title &apos;s title and a description which should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ example pages you &apos;ll see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file will be created to see the overview page . approxim@@ ate information about the export files can be found in .
finally , you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages . therefore , you can avoid that information is displayed in the viewer . for example , that all pictures are from a party . remember that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; at the moment all pictures exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain considerations .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages will look like . most settings are clear , which is why not specifically received .
below you can adjust different solutions to the pictures . by this , those who have to look at your website and have a monitor which support maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images download , for example , you have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer on your page can change the resolution at any time you have fixed . so , it can search your images with lower resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time , then if he wants to get a picture larger then he moves to a higher resolution .
in this setup area , set the different folder and URL where your website is stored .
best to select for all your HTML files a base folder and for each subsequent sentence a new sub@@ folder .
first , you need to select the root folder in which all your images are stored . this folder is stored and automatically transfer@@ ed to the next time . here you can choose either a folder or a KDE Support protocol , for example :
once you have created your images , you can check if this really is all visible for viewers . if you have created a web browser , after the pages have been created , this folder should be . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the files created by you do not have to copy them in the final destination folder , you must manually copy it . so that the import function , see , right works you will need to specify the final target of the files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are in .
the options described below have set out all three to basic folders or UR@@ Ls . this is created a sub@@ folder , whose name will define you in the issu@@ ing folder .
in case you are on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to have a HTML page for viewing the images . if you have already eaten a lot of time for viewing the images , reception , etc. to write , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ nu@@ album ; this work will not even be done .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import other files into your database . the image features will be imported and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images are stored in the file or whether the file is stored in the file . the advantage is that you have all images together and that you can share it independently . the obvious disadvantage is however the file size .
you can export a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file ... or together with HTML pages , see if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file looks for the pictures in a fold way . first , the pictures are not found in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . the corresponding pictures are not found , so the pictures of the URL , which you created when creating the HTML files . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML @-@ Export .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the following , dialogue for export of images is described , which you can export over the menu file ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most important option of this dialogue is whether it is to be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . it will provide you with the following three choices :
when selecting manu@@ ell in the vicinity of the .@@ k@@ im file , you must copy the images into the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option automatic to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; k@@ nu@@ album ; the pictures automatically copy for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most images have been comp@@ ressed with JPEG comp@@ ressed and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth the files to comp@@ ress . if you wish to , just choose the option export file comp@@ ressed .
the last option of this page is limit maximum image size . if you want to send your friends images , the .@@ k@@ im file might not be very big . here you can limit the size by saying that each picture is at most 800 pixels high and wide .
when you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file , you will select &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in .
the assistant to im@@ pose consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the import images are to be copied .
it may be that you are the category individuals who are named in import@@ ing the file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is called for your database . therefore , you will be imported into the third dialog windows , which categories which are imported to imported file and which categories that suit your database .
in the fourth step you can import the categories of import into the categories of your current database . an example for this can be seen on the picture .
it must be easy to browse images and look at : if you see pictures , one often wants to look at pictures of your Italy holiday &amp; m@@ ash ; if you want to discover pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures of which this friend is depic@@ ted .
in this manual you will find the various steps from ( 1 ) capture the information about your images , about ( 2 ) the flow and view , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and adapt@@ ations .
K@@ Photo@@ album was taken as a program for re@@ viewing your images . but it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but frequently it also closes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ nu@@ album , stores all of its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ pp@@ y disk or re@@ visions of the CV@@ S , where they would like to .
&amp; k@@ nu@@ album , remember the folder in which your images are stored and used this at future starter . if you want to start a different folder tree with images , you can start &amp; k@@ photographer album ; with the option -@@ c . as an example : k@@ nu@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / Images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
over the menu entry settings , set up ; assem@@ ble to a window where you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ ari@@ album ; in the following section of the user &apos;s manual , you will explain the different settings options .
to the left you see six different symbols , with which you can access settings and options for the viewers . for each setting there is a detailed help available , you can call on the F1 button and a click on the desired option .
in this case , you describe how you can specify different properties , such as people , places and tags . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
you can see the dialog , which is used to already edit existing groups . for each existing group you can select a marking and selecting a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories already mentioned . in dialogue options , you can set complete members groups , i.e. , for example , all members of a group will count on once in a group rather than in a group of members as described in a group .
in view the settings that are available to you for fix@@ ing the member groups . with the above @-@ listed listing list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window lists , a list with the current category and on the right is a list of categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its module system with other graphic applications , such as di@@ gi@@ Kam and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin interface . nails information can be found on the home page of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called on the menu modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; are , but are distributed separately . however , most modules have a help page that you can call on the modules themselves .
since the modules can be used together by several applications each other , it can be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; therefore , you should try new modules first with the demo database . therefore , you should either call up the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu help . say not , I would not have warned you !
the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not function . this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications can &apos;t use their pictures into albums : this type of order is not supported , simul@@ ates it for some modules the order after albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photographer album .
simul@@ ated &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view , so all the pictures that show you the picture shows at the moment .
next to the latest album must be recorded &amp; k@@ nu@@ album ; the modules also still pass a list of albums . here , &amp; k@@ issed album ; how follows :
when &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module .
or it will set the category which you have set in the setup dialog as a category for virtual albums . for example , if you are using the category people , it will be chosen as if you would have chosen people to view and pass this module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible can you remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog and select in the area modules , which modules will be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example of a screen screen , once you set &amp; k@@ nu@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are familiar with it from any other KDE application , you can see the window with which you can browse your image database . at the moment , it does not contain a lot of information about your images . in the section we will come back to this window , but then click the listing which shows you an overview with all available images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see each picture with editorial notes . this includes information about the persons listed on the picture , where the image has been recorded either individually or for a larger number of images provided specific remarks at the same time . if for example on all pictures Is@@ su@@ pers@@ eded and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen .
all these comments can be used for seeking and brow@@ sing as you can read in section . if you like , you can see these notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view three lists with a text field by choosing people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you will always use it again if you enter information about your images .
the following idea is to re@@ loc@@ ating the images within the list : if you have for example a family party and are shown at all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , so you can find that the names used to be moved up , the people can find faster and arrange .
if you prefer to receive an alphab@@ e@@ tically modified list , click on the icon for Sor@@ teren by date below the list .
if you have selected any remarks on each picture individually , you may like to edit all the selected images and provide these pictures with editorial notes . simply click on the above and back @-@ buttons , which are under the preview of the picture right above .
if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more comfortable to mark all these images and to use the menu item multiple entries on once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . besides , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context @-@ menu of the qu@@ il@@ dial@@ ogs it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also drag an entry to a category and drop it to a sub@@ category of this item . respect , this requires that you are just using your categories alphab@@ e@@ tically . see this .
you can post@@ p@@ one the individual elements of the ca@@ der@@ dial@@ ogs which form the top @-@ edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make a private window by selecting it outside the window .
if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... that offers you the option to store the current layout and appearance of the window .
you can also let a frame completely bl@@ ends . if you want to see this window later , use the button options ... and then window will be a / off . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the entry images in the browser you &apos;ll get an overview with preliminary images of the currently selected images , or any pictures if you do not have a filter . you can configure the size of the curtains , by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it simple .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set as a back@@ picture for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , it is displayed in the image center . if you don &apos;t have a window opened with a picture display , a new ad view is created .
you can also delete pictures in the preview feature . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press the Edit button . now , you will see the window displayed in the picture you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photographer album ; you can also use a solution for this problem . you can also use the images on your hard disk . of course you have to record the images anywhere , so that you can record the images anywhere ; in the picture you see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all necessary images can be loaded from your hard disk .
images where the right ob@@ sc@@ ary corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the images 5 @-@ 9 , however , the predic@@ tions exist , so that &apos;s images can show you . however , you can &apos;t view these pictures with the image center .
as you don &apos;t need this function to copy files from the folders and then copy them again . &amp; k@@ nu@@ album ; therefore , it does not support you to avoid the recording of the concerned CD . if you want to avoid any hass@@ le , how to avoid moving one @-@ edge of your images , please buy a larger disk in order to save all images on it .
in the menu images you will find a sub@@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to stay a little bit more privacy , you would like to im@@ pose any more privacy in the menu . alternatively , you can also click all the pictures that may see your little sister , cont@@ eu@@ ve and choose the menu entry all besides current view .
there@@ with you have fixed what pictures in the fall of the case will be hidden . if you want to block the laptop with your little sister , allowing all the images you have locked in . if you want to see the pictures again , click on lock .
it is also possible to set a password that needs to be inserted to the un@@ lock of the pictures . to set this password , simply select password in the menu privacy .
please bear in mind that this picture guard is by no means very safe . for example , you can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml , the password as un@@ encryp@@ ted text or delete . this type of password protection applies only to those who are with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to the view of private pictures .
the reason why you want to spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; of course you manage them at some time . for this reason you want to see them sometime . for this reason , it has a picture _ and video med@@ al . you can preview this from the preview , as described in .
the viewer can see you in . he naturally shows the image , but additional all the information you enter into the picture , e.g. who is on the image , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see it , you can also drag them with your mouse and get somewhere else . you can also configure what information is displayed and whether all these options are available according to a right click on the viewers .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here , see the matching entries on this page . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you were selected from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene would have chosen .
if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them back and back by using the keys picture high and image . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also accessible from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as di@@ asch@@ au . &amp; k@@ nu@@ album ; then it invites a new image after a few seconds . how often it can load a new image by pressing the Str@@ g button and Plus or minus . started and stopped running the di@@ asch@@ au by the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability of be@@ holder of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is to be changed in full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer use the complete place on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to the full screen mode and back .
when you use the spect@@ ator you can use the image and draw out zo@@ oming . with the mouse button you can simply drag a rectang@@ le . with the minus button you can come back r@@ aus@@ zo@@ oming The Plus Taste zo@@ om@@ t in the middle of the picture shows how a z@@ oom @-@ rectang@@ le is highlighted and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button you can reset your z@@ oom so that the picture is not shown zo@@ omed . with the equation , the zo@@ oms uses the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel corresponds to the screen of a pixel of the image .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations are working with videos that are in and out and zo@@ oming with the plus and minus key .
with the rotation functions from the context menu , you can turn the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current picture with the menu item remarks from the context menu .
if you can look at pictures it may happen to put an image with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can preview the image and configur@@ ations dialog by the picture to insert this name . however , you will perhaps prefer to mark the image and consider additional pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want to start the viewer with the images and watch them as good or bad , while watching one by one .
for the two examples above there is the spect@@ ator the possibility to provide pictures with characteristics while you are viewing . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can press a characteristic that you press the corresponding letter . in look at a picture where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set on your images , these are available to you in the browser . so you can see them in the browser . therefore , you can use all the images you want . this is described in . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the viewing view . if you can browse categories in D@@ re Vor@@ view@@ view , then you can press features to the pictures once the image was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on an image . for this case allows you &amp; k@@ ari@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
the painted is not saved with the image , but in the database . in the way you can do your painted later .
in the picture you can see a picture in the painted picture . to switch the Mal@@ mo@@ dus of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; to turn off the painting paint from the context menu . to end the M@@ alen , simply put the cross at the tool@@ bar top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you have to rule the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; not completely domin@@ ate , but the documentation to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; should you necessarily have read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and displays the object in the wi@@ re@@ model views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects simultaneously . but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ object are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position in which you want to insert the object and click on the icon at the tool@@ bar or select a menu item in the menu .
there are several possible positions , the following pop@@ ups will be built , so that you can choose the correct position :
by del@@ eting either from the menu bar under be@@ g or from the context menu of right mouse button , you can then remove selected objects from the scene before .
if you have altered attributes , click to apply to these changes . do you have inv@@ ali@@ d values displayed . then you can correct the input data correct and then click on or put the changes with eff@@ lu@@ ence .
when you enter the path to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentary in the Easy dialog , you can call the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains already the user &apos;s documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview a preview in the original view .
press preview in the original view and a small example of the scene will be posted with the chosen texture . as preference , the entire texture will be selected ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross it locally .
the screens@@ hot shows the check@@ points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse and thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the check@@ points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire view . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shi@@ fts . you can change the shift through pul@@ ling with the mouse inside the entire window .
each object has an imag@@ ining level of visibility . you can indicate this value relative to the visibility of an or@@ derly object or as absolute value . objects will only appear when they are selected or their visibility is smaller , or equal to the tool@@ bar of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window display as preference . the object tree and display of the object features are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window @-@ order , or if you need a different type of arrangement , you can store them as desired . you can also store multiple window buttons and easily switch between different arrangements .
to an@@ chor a window or under a present view , drag the beg@@ inner to the top or bottom of a view . a rectang@@ le shows then the new position on .
to create a new column , drag the beg@@ inner to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then ancho@@ red on the right or left side of this view and extends to the overall height .
if you want to re@@ arrange several views over each other , drag the beg@@ inner in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views through clicking on the cardboard box top of the views .
the last possible window @-@ order are sw@@ apping views : beliefs that are not ens@@ hr@@ ined in the main window . to resolve a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the beg@@ inner onto the desktop or click on the small to the left above For@@ giving arrow in the trial .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the early bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu view you will find entries for any type of views . new views are sli@@ mming , you can an@@ chor it in any more popular place .
the current window display can save you with window @-@ order ... save it . it will display a dialog in which you can save the window of window under an existing or new name .
if you created a scene , you can ren@@ dering them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; this program has to be correctly installed . as this manual has been written , was &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 . this version is supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 .
to ren@@ dering the current scene , click on the icon ren@@ ders from the tool@@ bar or select the menu item scene ren@@ dering .
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . it controls the image size and the quality of the ren@@ dering . if you want to insert a scene in various sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many R@@ ender Mod@@ i , from a quick preview of up to full @-@ quality graphics .
if you click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar list or select R@@ ender Mod@@ i menu , the following dialogue will be opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can input any name , us@@ efully , but a name that lets the properties of the mode can be seen .
in the map map size you can set the width and height of the frame image . if you want only to ren@@ dering a small area of the image , select the cross section sc@@ ab@@ rupt section and enter the image section for ren@@ dering into the input field .
in the Com@@ ing field quality you can select the properties that uses &amp; Pov@@ ray ; to the ren@@ dering time . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex non @-@ diff@@ user Refle@@ ction . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user manual and Pov@@ ray ; .
if an image is issued with just a beam per pixel , there can be different mistakes . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ Ã¨ pattern or sp@@ ill effects in cur@@ ves and lines , besides sometimes details are not displayed , if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , pictures with this feature look better .
if you switch to anti @-@ ali@@ asing , switches and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than a beam of pixels . this technique means super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as a standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling the adjacent Pix@@ els with one . the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively , because every pixel is constantly further split and adap@@ tive as the record @-@ based color values depend .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray adds a beam up to the neighboring pixels with super @-@ sampling kits , then both pixels are charged with the pursuit of a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you calculate the deep @-@ value at 4 , a grid of 4x4 will be charged with a low @-@ value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams each pixels .
the difference between two pixels will be calculated : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exce@@ eds the pre @-@ given thres@@ hold , the pixels will be divided into 4 sub@@ pixel that will be tr@@ acked individually and tested for further sub@@ missions . the maximum depth of the record can be set with the lowest value .
another opportunity to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of smok@@ ers for the ray process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn right , &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use ref@@ lex@@ ion . this is an experimental property of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; it is an experimental property of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; it takes very long to calculate one scene with this property .
on this map map you can set whether the Alpha channels will be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel will then be transparent if the associated rays have no object .
opens a new window to display the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ Con@@ sol@@ en@@ core . when &amp; Pov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason for this here .
to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ scene to import , select the menu entry to Im@@ ports ... and select a file in dialogue window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; not the complete command hau@@ l of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; . if when be@@ ating error messages or war@@ nings appear , a dialog window shows a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; write this source code between the two special comments / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; this adds the source text of the object to import text file in the editor . to import objects in the scene , simply mark the source text in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with cop@@ ying and past@@ ing in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; also in .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; one scene ren@@ ders . usually this is Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
if you click on help in the original view , it opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the indicated object . place the path to your document ten@@ tion and version . if you have supported the version 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example on track record ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you include files not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the colour for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the colour for check@@ points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the colour of the rectang@@ le for the Vis@@ field in the camera view and in the window @-@ type characteristic .
you can set the object catch up of the points on the grid menu in the context menu of the wi@@ light model . you can adjust here the grid for shifting , sc@@ ann@@ ations and rotation .
larger values result in a precision wi@@ pe model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects like the ball you can adjust the detailed stage for two directions .
if you cross the High Detailed view for extended proj@@ ections , all the wire views are further divi@@ ding if the camera is using an advanced projection . advanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical proj@@ ections . this property gives better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering .
when you cross the wall you cross a wall behind the objects , a wall is displayed behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a chess column , consisting of two adjustable colors .
if you show ground to the bottom , a soil is hidden below the objects . the soil is displayed in a chess column , consisting of two adjustable colors .
if you can activate Kant@@ engl@@ Ã¤t@@ tung , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method used for the ren@@ dering of scenes . the values for depth and sw@@ elling can be set . more precise information about the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mod@@ i section .
on this page you can modify existing window regulations or create new window regulations . in the section window regulations is explained , how you can create window @-@ regulations and save .
das Kombin@@ ations@@ feld Standard @-@ Vent @-@ ordnung : displays all existing window buttons . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program .
the list of the current dat@@ an@@ das illustr@@ ates all existing windows . a new order can create you with the button below and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
each window of window is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all the views for the selected window order . new views can create you with the button Add and delete selected views with the button .
the position of the new window . with new column you create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with un@@ c@@ apping the window under the existing window , with map view , you will see a cardboard box together with the previous view and sw@@ aying view not in the main window but creates a separate window .
so you have just arrived &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and now you want to start with no more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow any steps in this tutorial , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , amongst others very popular : a bul@@ let on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings , before you complain that you as a result will only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for fir@@ ing , you should notice these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules may be applied to ren@@ dering as a result you get a black image .
if you don &apos;t fit a light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you only get a black image .
if you have everything error @-@ free , take a look at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : the following con@@ vol@@ ts window :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the tool@@ bar . read the documentation , so that you can get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modular ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . highlight the scene and then select the menu item editing . that &apos;s why you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene which you generate . in particular , you notice the in the fourth wire view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you can see the content of the view object properties , where the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user &apos;s guide to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; you will find more details .
do not change anything to the basic settings of the camera , this is later reserved to instructions , but note that the camera in the view check@@ points will change . just click with the left mouse button on a con@@ load point and drag it to the desired location .
if you use the kno@@ b or press the input paste , the wire model views and the object tree immediately change these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could insert a quot@@ ation ( inser@@ ting body j@@ ader ) and size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but that &apos;s an understanding method for solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; actually provides a simpler option . you can use an infinite level as a floor :
a good advice : select the plain in the object tree , change the name and then press the button . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire @-@ model view also shows the plane , even if at the moment it ren@@ dering only a limited plane . if you ren@@ dering the scene , the plane stretched up to the horizon .
if you can examine the object tree exactly , you will notice that you can choose the entry for the floor . in this case , you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will find the different parameters for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation , and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene , you should move the ground to exercise a unit under the horizon , only to get you acquainted with some of these parameters . select shifting and set the values as follows :
just choose the ground up to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something in the moment .
in both cases , a dialog , where you can select how the object is to be inserted . please select the object tree . the pig@@ ment will then change in the object tree ( name = floor pig@@ ment ) , with one click on the button preview , see how the pig@@ ment looks like now .
of course , the preview of the pig@@ ment only shows a Matte box material because you can still enter settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , you &apos;ll always remember the colors for pig@@ ment at any time with a click on preview . also , there are many possibilities , but you are now taking the sim@@ pl@@ est .
if you do not preview any color on qu@@ asi@@ cub@@ es and ball , click on the button and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now right now . if you hit your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following results :
of course this is not the Far@@ ben@@ . you are expected to enter two new attributes . in the Far@@ ben@@ list you need to enter two new attributes . then select this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the chess board list can only be used with two colors ) :
select the object tree every time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
this step you should simply be able to execute simply because you should have understood the fundamental working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the bul@@ let can be just as simple as the floor :
in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . Set the value for radius : on 1 ( do not forget the cover paste or the kno@@ b to squee@@ ze ) so the ball has float above the ground , since you have postpon@@ ed the ground for a unit down .
of course , the ren@@ dering yiel@@ ds now a strange result : as previously seen before , the ball appears like a Matt@@ el black material . Set in the following step with suitable material .
if you chose the ball , you can as@@ sign your material now . as is the ground , let the ball give a pig@@ ment as color :
select the object and change the name for example in the sphere of pig@@ ment . click on the ball pig@@ ment , then select one color and set the values as follows :
but you can get more interesting effects if you take the time to set some fin@@ ish features :
then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on or press the input paste .
the attitudes shine @-@ effect and reflection already result in partial visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal : still not selected at all :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you have &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
when you switch to a scene ray@@ trac@@ er , the ren@@ derer goes hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the be@@ holder ( d. h. from the camera that identi@@ fies the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene and how atmosph@@ eric effects of light sources in the scene and like atmosph@@ eric effects such as fo@@ g . thus , the scene will be processed for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you see the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the image is simple . obviously any scene , which is to be rolled , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be added to this sub@@ menu and replace the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and disk space .
imagine the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage will be dis@@ car@@ ded .
you can only select this menu if you do not have stored changes in the scene .
repeatedly , the last re@@ ver@@ ted command . this menu entry can only select if you have used def@@ ences .
saves the current window of window and opens up a dialog , where you enter a name for a new order or write an existing order .
in this menu you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; here you can change the look , the keyboard , and the basic behaviour .
opens a dialog for change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can edit or add new commands with this option . you may change or add new commands with this option .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove the tool@@ bar for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : commands .
a plat@@ former map is a way to pull @-@ up surfaces without having to model any b@@ ump on the surface individually mod@@ elling and without changing the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file both for a b@@ ump @-@ map as well as for a texture map .
land@@ lords are simple geomet@@ rical forms that can use as a building blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from do@@ zens of thousands or even hundreds of this basic body . these models will then be processed in order to give them a realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object to pixel base , by using a image file as a colour card .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show , is a comfortable screen view and navig@@ ator . the application has a file browser in which you can choose pictures to display .
images can either be displayed in an own window in the size of the picture or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show , is very simple . the file browser lists files you can go with Click &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the button return .
you can set whether every image should appear in a separate window , or if all pictures should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first characters of the fil@@ enam@@ efeld in the browser window . then appears a small entrance field in the right lower corner . if an appropriate fil@@ ename is found , the file is highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing by return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialogue section - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show , there are five card cards . in three of them , gener@@ als and processing and slideshow , you can define the working method of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; set in the two other , short @-@ rest warran@@ t for the browser , the key@@ boards for the respective windows can be specified .
if this is selected , then the pictures are opened in full @-@ screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the ad surface is filled with the background color that you can set further down . pres@@ et is not a full screen mode .
is this point activated , loads &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you can still watch the current picture . this reduces the delay whenever you choose the next image and is particularly suitable for a slide show .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show , when entering the name of the last opening orders . the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click the colored bars to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mo@@ dus the window is bigger than the image is also filled here the background with the selected color .
you can establish &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; to display only some of the file types , which can represent the program also .
with this option the ad @-@ view to the full screen is increased . this option is enabled as default .
defines whether the slideshow starts with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
the time @-@ span between the change of image in a slideshow . to change the value , you can input a new value in the input field or use the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repet@@ itions . this value is set to 0 , the slideshow is broken until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to enter the value , you can use a new value in the input field or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 1 .
change the key@@ boards for the different operating types of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the cards @-@ cards short @-@ rest warran@@ t for the ad @-@ file and shor@@ th@@ ar@@ rest warran@@ t for the browser .
with this option you turn off between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the first @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in a window around .
displays large symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is possible only in short version .
displays small symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is possible only in short version .
shows form@@ ations for the files in the folder . this display is possible only in short version .
the picture reduced by 10 % . the factor refers to the actual size of the image .
the picture increases 10 % . the factor refers to the actual size of the image .
includes the ad @-@ view for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show , it is also closed , if no brow@@ sing window is open more .
display the image in original size . this is only useful when the automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
opens the input field for understanding . enter the first characters of the fil@@ enam@@ el you &apos;re looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .

&amp; # foto 1.jpg makes it as easy as possible errors or possible improvements to login . where you will find a dialog with a link . if you use this , your browser opens a page for reports of problems and wishes . all required information is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to post your message .
&amp; # foto : is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; po@@ foto 1.jpg
the best start to participate &amp; # foto : to join it , it is the developer mailing list . guide to join the developer &apos;s mailing list from &amp; Plus foto .
&amp; Ellen foto : try to give you much control over your work@@ flow as possible . change . to access these settings , you must select in the menu settings - foto 1.jpg ; the setup dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these settings by pressing on the symbols of the left side .
in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ ride of India should be chosen . dex@@ ter@@ ings should display the colors with what you are to display in contrast . under@@ lining should display a bright color and over@@ exposed colour .
the main window of &amp; scre@@ ens ; has a side bar at the right edge that provides you important information and actions to the selected pictures . you can also see this page in picture editing . you can display this in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; is an application for the scan of images that do not make more than scan images and p@@ add@@ ling .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; is a simple application for the scan of images that do not make more than pictures and sc@@ ei@@ vers . &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; it can save for each image to save a dialog with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images before saving .
you can check the status of your Sc@@ ann@@ ers on the SAN@@ E project page using the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ lite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in terminal can be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog to choose the sc@@ ann@@ ers is opened .
the user can select the sc@@ rolling scanner and push OK to open the scanner . ab@@ ort &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; stop .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options particularly .
to take a picture , the user can only start a preview can and then search for scanning area for the final scan . the preview can be launched by the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can zo@@ oming into the image and out of the current selection out zo@@ oming . he can also adjust the z@@ oom so that the complete preview fits into the window .
if the image was selected then the final picture can be read with the scan button .
if before saving a preview is selected in the settings , then the image is displayed in a window showcase , as shown below is displayed . if stor@@ ks is pressed , then the image is stored and sle@@ y ? en leads to a desc@@ endant and you get back into the main window .
through the kno@@ b@@ able settings , the hom@@ onymous dialogue will be opened before the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired , in front of the stor@@ ing . in this case the option for stor@@ ing a preview must be selected . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option needs to be selected .
this setting allows them to select the way as &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; images can open . dialog to the stor@@ ing for each image open the dialog in front of the sc@@ ann@@ ed image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; this automatically generated with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select stor@@ ing without having to ask for a fil@@ ename .
this setting defines where images can be stored in the option saved without a fil@@ ename . if the images are stored after each scan , this folder is used as default for the dialog to Save . the default value is your native directory and you can change it with the button .
this parameter defines a pre@@ fix for the automatic to save pictures and is in addition the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically stored image receives a numer@@ ical Su@@ ff@@ ix of every time a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adapt to the stor@@ ing image quality . this value also changes the comp@@ ression mode to save . if select the image quality is not selected , the default value is used by Q@@ t .
the button help starts the KDE @-@ Help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; -@@ manual . the button About starts the KDE About -@@ Di@@ alogue for &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; the button of the button displays the dialog for the settings and shots may be used to stop &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; to finish .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used as all other programs key@@ boards . below you can set a list of these short@@ cut and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts you can set up by right mouse button in the player window and selecting the button @-@ button you click with the right mouse button in the player window and select short @-@ command .
you may set up existing multimedia buttons , that they as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ short command will work . thus make your keyboard around &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Control Center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions which are mostly also found in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browsers , player , play@@ list , play@@ lists and scripts . an example call for the D@@ CO@@ P function or example ; look like :
Amar@@ ok supports the command@@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command@@ line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script is not executed due to a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all the required modules are present and take advantage of the dialog , so that the user interface is not running .
begin Salon &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ und@@ um ( KDE bind@@ ings for Ruby ) from k@@ de@@ bind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
in the folder scripts / load you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts , or simply expand it to expand the required functions . you will quickly determine that writing scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P you can replace your scripts with Amar@@ o@@ ok and Amar@@ o@@ ok . the easiest way is using the command &apos;s command d@@ co@@ p ; which every KDE installation should include .
most scripts allow the execution of external programs and commands . in this way the function ex@@ ec ( ) is used . this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively simply . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; sends a not@@ i@@ fications to all running scripts . this is why scripts , will continuously monitor their standard input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script should ignore the events even if there is no use for it .
configure indicates the script to display the Easy dialog . to store the stor@@ ing and loading of the setup data , each script needs to be run . if a script is started , Amar@@ o@@ ok sets the work@@ folders on the folder , where all data should be saved .
tr@@ ack@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script could now be &amp; eg ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions further information on the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or tri@@ ckl@@ es ) .
vol@@ um@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume sign@@ aled a change in volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ izing Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le , contains the path to select the selected files from play@@ list , if a user @-@ defined menu item can use the D@@ CO@@ P @-@ function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ script ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) . to remove an entry again you d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script re@@ mov@@ e@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ o@@ e stops , or when the user stops a script , send &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , such as the stor@@ ing of data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ ine script management can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ Archive ( .t@@ ar ) , which can also be comp@@ ressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend a archive name such as e.@@ gi@@ .@@ amar@@ ok@@ scrip@@ t.@@ bz@@ 2 , so that the user can clearly recognise the archive as Amar@@ o@@ ok script .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the Advanced frame script . for this reason , you should name your script packages as well .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the rest of the lad@@ der modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file &apos;s rights :
if your script is finished , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wiki script page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; script .

the screen screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to define what screen to appear on a multi @-@ speed monitor environment .
the map card audio @-@ output lets you select an audio driver from the selection field . some drivers enable you to activate even more settings in this card menu .
the Kart@@ ei@@ Card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for collection .
here you can select the folder , which search &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to search for music files . to include a folder in the collection named after his name . this section also contains calls @-@ fields to set , as it should be used with the selected folders .
sub@@ folder reaction : this causes that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; both the trans@@ figured as well as their sub@@ folder after music will search .

similar interpre@@ ters are retri@@ eved : according to activ@@ ating this setting is made &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters to the each playing pieces will be retri@@ eved . you can see the list in context @-@ browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; eg ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen photos .
Amar@@ ok only requires the package K@@ deli@@ ver@@ b and otherwise no further KDE packages . you need to have K@@ deli@@ bs to be installed ( including the programs contained therein , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to be compiled for example modules or scripts ) . we have a small guide written how to compile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal booked .
some features such as O@@ SD considers that your window managers will set the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . G@@ NO@@ ME is thus going to work , but flu@@ x@@ box will aid for example . we try to support Amar@@ o@@ ok on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they represent an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the t@@ agli@@ b library . please report this bug to the t@@ agli@@ der software under bu@@ g@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org and you also hang the kap@@ ut@@ te file that has created the crash . afterwards , you can delete the file and restore the collection again .
mostly this is that t@@ agli@@ b in reading the met@@ a information from this file cr@@ ashes . please report this bug to the t@@ agli@@ b developers under bu@@ g@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure that all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries with the same compiler version were compiled . if , B. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , t@@ agli@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x compiled this leads to crash when using the met@@ a information .
if you use KDE with art@@ s@@ d then de@@ activate automatic . switch off , if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least not a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically at a crash ) . if it is a common kick @-@ down , and send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is because many programs input data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ info , but this is not identified as Un@@ ic@@ ode . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PAN -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repet@@ ition / dynamic play@@ list ) see KDE 3.@@ 4.0 always active . this is a known error in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . in times , you can click on the control centre by image and half @-@ transparent . keep in mind that in some cases , you have to click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p Q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will first find the correct version first .
there are some ways . most installation problems clear the ligh@@ test by means of an expert on your Uni@@ xes or Linux distribution . you can also use assistance with other users or for the developers . use the Forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the canal # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter there only one bug when you find something about the bug of a bug on Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; only a blank play@@ list will appear there . how are music tracks there now ?
this is easy . use the file &apos;s browser to the left and open the folder . then drag files to the right part of the play@@ list .
to keep the surface intu@@ iti@@ vely , the start @-@ window has been converted into the statistics window . you find it under Ex@@ tras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ o@@ 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : STARS are standing for the evaluation by the user , while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces must be displayed in the play@@ list the rating list must be displayed . click on the top list of the play@@ list and select column . click somewhere in the new application column , to set the rating for a piece . you can also use the short @-@ command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is located in the background .
select the files you want to remove , then press off on your keyboard . or click on your selection and then select the play@@ list from the pop@@ s button .
drag a play@@ back file with your mouse into the play@@ list and let them fall there , just like you would do it with other files . so simple is that : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list , directly next to the add @-@ button , is the button to save the button . click on it .
probably no missing the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; new . look at lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ alis@@ ations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you can find him via the men@@ ub@@ ber under extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no . yes , that &apos;s true really ! not ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one by the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the real issue of the Wh@@ ich media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support so rather than memorable audio format . G@@ Stream@@ er can even add text and PNG !
it may ! maybe you use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which means no MP3 @-@ de@@ coder ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ hat mp3 k@@ de , Rhin@@ oplast@@ ics
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s ab : - )
if you use the G@@ Stream@@ er driver with AL@@ SA S@@ ink , the device must be able to use a mix@@ er . a bl@@ ender allows several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously can be accessed through the d@@ mix module for AL@@ SA ( software bl@@ ender ) . take a look at the Help D@@ mix for AL@@ SA .
the output of this command should help you search for the problems once a matter and a solution . for G@@ Stream@@ er you may need to specify a different rope ( e.g. os@@ s@@ m ) .
this is done &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first be de@@ co@@ ded . G@@ Stream@@ er is for most people the best choice if you &apos;re looking for a decade or with little over@@ head . G@@ Stream@@ er reads the file , de@@ co@@ ded it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ co@@ ded the data first . G@@ Stream@@ er can spend directly to AL@@ SA as well as x@@ in .
use either the G@@ Stream@@ er driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open check@@ up sound &amp; multimedia sound system . enable Sound@@ server with highest possible priority ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ ap@@ per is set is :
at KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause un@@ disturbed reproduction . read this error report . the magnific@@ ence of the sound bu@@ ff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA @-@ setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c also can help .
either you do not use the arts driver but instead G@@ Stream@@ er or x@@ ine , or install KDE multimedia completely to get the quicker Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc . ) .
pres@@ um@@ ably use the arts driver . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts bu@@ ffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , the less applications react to visu@@ alis@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stream@@ er is installed , but when I want to change to the G@@ Stream@@ er driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; starting . why ?
after installing G@@ Stream@@ er you need to register all components . run G@@ ST register to register all G@@ Stream@@ er components .
read the G@@ Stream@@ er FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ pe@@ g , compile and install it . then install G@@ ST file and once as your normal user . then delete in the module folder of G@@ Stream@@ er all ff@@ m@@ pe@@ g files ( you find the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
please report that under bu@@ g@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org. if you have a whole list of suggestions / wishes , send them best to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name gives the magic ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and release the alarm to this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running before you go to bed , then you will have awak@@ ened by the gentle tones of the music that you stopped in front of bed .
how to find the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; going on the current title , if you are on another computer ?
if a functioning SS@@ H environment is available , you can proceed as follows . diesel command gives you inter@@ pre@@ t and title of the current piece : ssh -@@ I ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user un@@ user
replace IP @-@ address with your IP and I@@ hr@@ us@@ ername with your us@@ ername . this requires that your identification is present in the file ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA .
the visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; press button on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens up in an independent , in the size of changing windows .
the combination of Str@@ g + Rights button is a piece in the sequence in the queue . by pressing the input paste after a search in the play@@ list , the first search results will be played and the search is reset .
OK , the player window and play@@ list have tri@@ ck@@ rich functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the control box ?
click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers are to be displayed .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on a NFS drive . after starting from Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and on the console appear many error messages .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; doesn &apos;t work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / p / Amar@@ ok on a local drive or use am@@ aro@@ K@@ s MySQL support .
put the CD a , then click on the button on audio CD . it opens up a file browser with multiple folders . to normal output , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired target folder in a con@@ quer@@ or window . instead , you can convert files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g .

basically this is the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has every single assessment on the overall result .
you can enter the rating for a piece by clicking on a column trans@@ cription in the play@@ lists window . then select the rating of a piece of piece just as you click with the right mouse button on the piece and edit : review , select or set F2 . you can edit the rating in the dialog met@@ adata .
the developers do not want you to tell you when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means that KDE packages have set up a fixed publishing plan that is not together with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new function in Amar@@ o@@ ok that some users can also be able to find annoying . de@@ activate the option icon when playing animated in the general settings .

Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service to the information that is played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free us@@ ername and password . Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok .
if you would like to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of distr@@ action and therefore also causes a lot of error reports .
pres@@ um@@ ably , &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok was compiled before you have x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine these output modules will not compile . you have to configure &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new to configure and install .
well , I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules appear still not . and now ?
pres@@ um@@ ably you use a distribution which is installed separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stream@@ er is installed , the necessary development files are also installed for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . afterwards you have to compile and Amar@@ o@@ ok ; again , you need to compile and install again .
I cl@@ ing the error G@@ Stream@@ er @-@ Crit@@ ical * * : factory for &apos; ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stream@@ er was compiled with Pre@@ dus which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stream@@ er . you need to compile G@@ Stream@@ er without Pre@@ sto . a tip from Mer@@ lin @-@ TC : Ver@@ wen@@ ge do not compile L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .

I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ o@@ ok the second sound card ?
using settings Amar@@ o@@ ok ... audio output , you enter the device . typically , e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an on@@ board AC@@ 97 @-@ co@@ dec and an USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l@@ .@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter the setup dialog by x@@ ine now us@@ b audio , and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the sampling rates , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , dis@@ able the tick on sound@@ card supports m@@ map .
we are sorry but the audio issue with Arts will not be cared for . you should of course be happy to take this problem yourself in your hand ! if you would like , you can get the new so much needed car@@ et@@ akers for Arts : )
listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason there is the registered assistant who would like to update your collection , or if you simply don &apos;t like your collection , then this quick launch guide will be a help . with her help you will have set yourself &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes .
creating a play@@ list is very simple . drag the mouse entries from the collection box to the play@@ list . if you are happy with the play@@ list , you can save it with the play@@ list right now . if you can save it with the play@@ list , you can save it using the button bar list . you can find this button in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ lists window .
if you have own play@@ lists , you can add these play@@ lists to add to the play@@ list . if the play@@ list is already activated in the folder of your collection , then these play@@ lists are already loaded onto a play@@ list . with a right click on a play@@ list you will find various options , such as the play@@ list is to be loaded .
to play an audio CD , please select in the menu bar please select actions audio CD . it opens up a file browser with several folders and the CD @-@ pieces in WAV format . drag the WAV files into the play@@ list and then press the button back .
the audio CD @-@ function uses the protocol audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the ro@@ wer function is also available in the play@@ list . simply click with the right mouse button on an entry and follow the burning menu . you have here various options for burning a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sets the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . also some additional packages are listed below , which make work with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok .
if you install these packages on a package management system ( e.g. RPM or ap@@ t ) , you will need to install the development versions of this packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . as well as every normal multimedia player also has a play@@ list , which is superior to all the other features . however , a play@@ list contains several browsers that you can capture and browse all the others .
in this chapter we explain how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok will be used , including creating a collection and a play@@ list .
the player window is your One @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control centre . on the top of the window is a running text display , which indicates the current track or current stream . directly below is the area , the game time , bit@@ rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ates of the current piece again . a click on this area changes the display of the time already stopped game time of the piece .
in addition , the player window provides a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the running text display . you can switch through the available analy@@ zer by clicking on the section button .
the &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; -@@ Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlarged window .
under the run text , the buttons are also PL and E@@ Q . the button PL is enabled or dis@@ ables the play@@ lists window , while the button E@@ Q is used for setting E@@ quali@@ zer .
the rest of the player &apos;s window is made up of the play@@ list , the volume control and the piece @-@ positions sli@@ ders . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the piece position or volume . with the play@@ back buttons , you can stop the play@@ back and switch to the next or previous piece .
the use of the built @-@ in E@@ quali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from Classical to Tech@@ no , and you can easily create own pres@@ ets .
to display the E@@ quali@@ zer you use extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the button E@@ Q in the Player window . once you mark the cross @-@ lane E@@ quali@@ zer , the E@@ quali@@ zer is in operation .
the play@@ list of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the play@@ list developed play@@ list of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . she has many features that are there in no other player . however , you can not sc@@ are of the abundance of functions , they are all easy to use .
the play@@ lists window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation field . in the navigation area , you can find some of the excellent functions of the play@@ list , such as the context browser . on the right , the play@@ list is easy to use and yet even advanced users is powerful enough .
the context @-@ browser displays various information about each of the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context @-@ browser design . the context @-@ browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and performer . these three sub@@ windows will be explained later in detail . they provide information on the ongoing basis in each of the different aspects .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; perhaps you might find that the sub@@ window starts off . the information presented is now in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; moreover , the information can be collected in the statistics window ( Ex@@ tras Statistics ) .
the sub@@ window music shows information about the current piece , as well as the interpre@@ ter and the album .
the first section in this sub @-@ window shows information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , interpre@@ ters and the album . below you can see the album image of the album and next to a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this symbol to em@@ plate the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .

closes all open projects and ends &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . for each not stored project will be consul@@ ted , what should happen to happen , as if you had called the file .
if you open this entry , you can select the desired dialog files to add to the project . this has the same effect as if you enter the files directly from the top view into the project in view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files appear in the base folder of the CD .
opens the dialog &quot; burning &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; to burning the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make a lot of project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is that ? -@@ Help described ( reachable via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful when you consider files in a previous session to the current project . this is useful when this feature is not used , even if this function is not used for you , so that you can already see the existing files and folder on the medium .
this entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function returns &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . this function moves no files from the medium , it only ends the previously imported files again .
opens the cd @-@ cop@@ ying dialogue . this also allows without project file the cop@@ ying of a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also burn a picture of a CD instead of normal cop@@ ying . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs .
opening the DVD cop@@ ying dialogue . this also allows the cop@@ ying of a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also get the option of the cl@@ oning of a DVD with the help of cop@@ ying dialogue . besides , the target medium has to be big enough to absor@@ b the entire ( video ) data from the source medi@@ ums in the original form .

this will open a dialogue window to changing the key@@ boards for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after having selected one of the statements in the upper part you can adjust the ke@@ yp@@ ical order for it further down .
this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; input assistant . that allows you to adjust the correct author@@ ations to burning CDs and DVDs . for this , System@@ administrator &apos;s right is required , therefore you will have to enter the password for the system manager ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . here you can custom@@ ize general programming settings . nearly all features of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is intended for person@@ alisation and en@@ vision@@ ing the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also , with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ interface equipped with the help of this interface can be controlled by parts of the functionality for example through a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ functions to use , you can either use the command line d@@ co@@ p , or to use the slightly more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical to the function of the function , therefore , rather your taste and the type of your task is decisive , which the included programs you can give .
in this chapter we assume that you use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; you need to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; start . then enter something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ features that have all &amp; k@@ de ; program in common , supported &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts that are described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface between &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; features functions like copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other features available for generating new projects .
echo ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref Cre@@ ate@@ Ro@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref Cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref Cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) void h@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( Cur@@ l ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ vd@@ Image ( Cur@@ l ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XXX@@ Project @-@ method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ COP@@ Ref . # K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project obtained via # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project D@@ urch Compar@@ ing this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b provides the above mentioned K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the high @-@ performance K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which is only applicable on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string flags ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( cur@@ l : : List UR@@ Ls , Q@@ string flags ) void re@@ mov@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string new@@ name ) void set@@ Vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
so it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folder and then insert files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der foo d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der foo d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ t@@ xt / foo / bar

first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; be read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( simplify and comp@@ ressed ) ; and then
in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per title ) comp@@ ressed into the MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG format , or in other formats such as the los@@ sy FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ ences ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost any distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must now be done .
for the second step it must be installed ( for MP3 ) , og@@ ging pre @-@ up ( for O@@ GG ) or other Ko@@ di@@ erer . all these programs are usually not necessary for comp@@ iling the Linux distri@@ butions . however , only the co@@ aches are not used to compile it . if for example FLA@@ C is not used , the installation is not required .
which Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er- / File @-@ Format should be used ? the chapter Wh@@ ich Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about Ko@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and comp@@ ression factors .
a word for cop@@ ying from protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ ences ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; and this program is not intended to handle any cop@@ ying protection , it is not possible to handle any protected audio CD ; not avoid the mechanisms of cop@@ ying protection . simply avoid the purchase of cop@@ ying audio CD ; s !
while the setup has to be done only once ( the setup dialog can be accessed as often as a suitable configuration ) , following the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD ; on the hard drive , this leads ( hopefully ) to understanding the sl@@ ender approach of the interface , which you will often stum@@ ble in the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which body programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &apos;t collect &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB from the Internet or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is captured manually .
this is just a short list of commands of the main window . on the side step by step example there are more information on how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the program &apos;s configuration for the configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB enquiry according to the setup of inquiry in the CD@@ DB file . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case first the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
starts reading and - if a Encoder has been con@@ figured in the Settings menu &apos; tab - the co@@ ding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available en@@ coder , so that selecting with another coder can be read as the standard . it &apos;s considered to be noted that previously the Encoder has been con@@ figured in the Settings menu .
opens the file manager , so that an already selected file is selected for co@@ ding instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and add .
opens the intersection to configure the type of not@@ i@@ fications ( such as proto@@ cols , Pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programming events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; ends ) .
opens the main intro@@ duc@@ tory dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ ences ( such as Encoder , to set up the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes key quality , co@@ di@@ ers and comp@@ ression , and helps you to choose the right code .
if no audio information is to be lost is a ver@@ itable audio format required . besides FLA@@ C there are also others like &apos; hormones &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the down@@ sides are the small comp@@ ression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can be re@@ inst@@ ated these files .
among the audio formats , data received by data comp@@ ressing according to their p@@ sycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower Bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but over this bit@@ rate , the differences are less important , as both Ko@@ di@@ erer produce very good audio quality .
o &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still provided with most distri@@ butions for free but there are open license questions
+ High to very high audio quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG easy to deep@@ est quality for deep bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from one machine or a computer based musical system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG def@@ enses is present .
MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) , or special auto @-@ stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices are usually only the MP3 format .
a brief list of parameters for the audio quality and the resulting comp@@ ression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good visibility to most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces and has already quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , comp@@ ression mode up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , comp@@ ression rate about 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi @-@ stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R joint stereo , comp@@ ression install@@ ment approximately 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music of juven@@ iles , portable devices and auto@@ stere@@ o@@ grams . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps CB@@ R . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information provided manually or through the program automatically obtained from the free@@ DB via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can be transferred / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ ences ; and the co@@ ding program to create the folder and file names as well as the characteristics of the music files .
in connection with co @-@ programmes , there is often a combination of program settings for the co@@ ders and these parameters . the manual or the help to the co@@ di@@ ers declare the switches for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; title to the key@@ word ( English : day ) , if MP@@ 3@@ s will be co@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switches must be added to l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ ences ; the result looks as follows : &apos; ... -@@ tt { * } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ ences ; parameters used ( = Kno@@ ck @-@ drawing in the assistant ) :
this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database in which people can download the audio CD , so that all the other information can be downloaded , instead within the calcul@@ ator . it &apos;s considered to be noted that here only the text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes it should be legal , but I ( An@@ m . ) is not attorney . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; there is also information without the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so do not be added to the artist nor the music enterprise . all information can be dealt with at a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physically or virtu@@ oso .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ ences ; is active to select a cross field ( sending an address ) . for the use of free@@ DB may be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address as the specified in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the e @-@ mail address used for retri@@ ev@@ ing the data from the server ( this can only be the programmer who reviewed the code . )
there are many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ oph@@ ator is set up ; for the use of free@@ DB is needed , the geographical server is to be used on the next row of mirror . this saves band@@ width on the network and balances the load between the computers .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org delivers a current list of reflec@@ tor for the online call of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly created ) just the updates of the database .
which excer@@ pts is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that this c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used , who wants to know more accurately , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s. to note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package has to be installed from the matching distribution first if this has not yet been done .
for stor@@ ing the selected WAV files , the co@@ aster and therefore the desired file format are chosen for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( OG@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a ver@@ itable comp@@ ression for audio data ) on the tab . other Ko@@ di@@ erer can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer @-@ package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined ko@@ di@@ erer . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer can be found in the chapter Wh@@ ich Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a codi@@ fication , you can obtain more information about his switch by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a con@@ soles window ( eg ; Con@@ sole ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed co@@ di@@ ers .
this can have many causes . check out the decor of the device @-@ drawing of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the writing and les@@ bian of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for OG@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give an indication of what is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the envel@@ ope of the &amp; CD ; This is not going to succeed !
there is one chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , these tips can give you how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , everything is understood , but are somehow still uns@@ ure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by step example , and you will get enough information to set the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time to set up everything and our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos;@@ using MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key@@ word ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . an appropriate package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine , since it is not necessary to compile the source files , whatever you can do .
please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you own it ( eg ; by trying to copy something to the con@@ quer@@ or something ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ ences ; something which probably is done only once and
the second section describes how to proceed to read a &amp; CD ; what has to be repeated for each other &amp; CD ;
here we determine the forced lab@@ eler to comp@@ ression including the music ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . it is determined where the files are stored and which structure is used to use , we share the program with , the free@@ DB to use the &amp; CD ; data from the internet to download .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not change it with each output of a &amp; CD ; if once the matching settings are found .
the device @-@ labelling is handed over to the reading programme so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ Data / pieces can read .
frequently , / dev / CD@@ ROM should be a symbolic link to the actual device design@@ ation of your drive . if this does not work or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD disk can be indicated , it also helps a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the available entries of the device files for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the map map General settings . there is not much to do here . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything will be shown as shown in the screens@@ hot .
only with complete information can be selected , so that you will be informed when data for generating keywords ( tags ) are missing .
the map CD ; -@@ settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically downloaded over the Internet from a free@@ DB computer .
note : the machine must be connected while reading the &amp; CD ; connected to the Internet to access the free@@ DB server .
the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry found , will immediately start reading the &amp; CD ; . this is associated with the database entry and the fil@@ ename or day entries , they can easily change . the fil@@ ename or fil@@ ename is changed with con@@ quer@@ ors - &gt; ren@@ ame it and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , dem &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example it is further to note : if you want to manually enter everything you want to download the selection field and free@@ DB will not be used . however , this about 620 MB length , you have to be selected with free@@ DB in the Off@@ line mode , the two choices must be selected at least the first . mode is set up on the following map card .
CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eves the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB @-@ server via the Internet . how do the system , which data is to get the CD ? read the section about free@@ DB . put everything like it is pic@@ tured in the screens@@ hot .
mode : we do not have downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and see it after a mirror . on this path the load is distributed between the b@@ ills . however , this setting will work as a first attempt .
both function equ@@ ating what the server concerns , but there are many fire@@ walls to boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , maybe more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually is open to surf the internet .
in this example we do not want to provide any &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server ; the first cross@@ road will de@@ activate .
simply take the settings from the screens@@ hot . ( make sure that the folder / t@@ mp exists on your computer )
please read simultaneously : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive ? parall@@ eled reading and code ? the author does not know , therefore simply try itself .
CD ; after reading the last piece , we cross it to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you are covered this touch , then / must be stored on the path / folder in which the WAV files are stored . if the field is not covered , the files are created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to make a something with the WAV files .
everything to be used as it is in the screens@@ hot . the command is a bit long , under circumstances something to go to the right is to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is approximately 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved comp@@ ression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of the generation of tags at version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted as required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; day for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
Set the rest like in the screens@@ hot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of members at the same time ad@@ di@@ ating WAV files : with a dual core or Quad@@ core , or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to add more than a WAV file at the same time .
that is , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oph@@ ator ; this configuration is used as default for each output of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music enough , you never need to change it again .
in this section it is described as the process of output of the &amp; CD ; the folder structure , the type like the music on the hard drive is structured , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB will need to pick up . the process of the free@@ DB is described in this section , must be repeated for each other &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD ; that is not yet contained in free@@ DB , see the screen photos a bit different from the data for a &amp; CD ; with successfully used by free@@ DB data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually input , instead of pick them out of the internet . comments are to be noted on the differences .
don &apos;t try to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet done so now the &amp; CD ; into the drive , it has been defined in the main window to be pushed back .
after a short moment the pieces should be listed in the window and their length in the window , just like in the screens@@ hot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen , then seek in section questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding basic settings .
note : if the &amp; CD ; successfully managed by the free@@ DB , all the titles of the pieces are already filled out , and in addition , the artist &apos;s name and the album are also indicated .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; the key for your &amp; CD ; there is a window appears , and you can select the database entry that &apos;s best to your &amp; CD ;
if you do not have the cross@@ fire for automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialogue for settings ) , you can also manually input this by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database but the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - entering the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
specify the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; Cur@@ rent title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist must not be given any more in the input field &apos; Cur@@ rent title &apos; unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece .
the bottom comment can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ em per piece , the comment field of the album will be used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful recall of the data from the free@@ DB is not empty , it contains already the data like in the following screens@@ hot . however , it is always a good idea to start the content of the CD @-@ editor , so that you can not only start with the artist and album names ( e.g. if all words with big letters start or not ... ) but also to examine if there are any unwanted comment .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ tags . this option is limited to the length of fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters in the commentary box . if you are ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags ; maximum this option will be set on the tab code and have a look at the section &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the day @-@ information of the created files at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all co@@ di@@ ans or file formats . see in the help for the Ko@@ di@@ erer to get more information .
simply select one entry which is obviously agre@@ eing with the style of the registr@@ ated CD ; in this example this is not important because we don &apos;t transmit the &amp; CD ; for further information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example can be found under rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD Ed@@ itors will be back and you see that the panels are already filled with the entered data that we &apos;ve captured for the first piece . just enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . enter the title of the piece to any case and other information you want .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way to you all the titles of the &amp; CD ; have entered .
note : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third kno@@ b of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed about the piece list .
note that there is a check @-@ sign in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are marked so are read out . a simple click on the line split@@ s off the selection of the piece , or choose the button , select all the pieces at the bottom of the screen to choose all the pieces on a once .
was launched by clicking on the button below , so this window appears to be confirmed . OK , and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow whatever proceeds .
click the tab orders to turn on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message you see if you are trying to work with a stove , which you have not yet installed . pieces that were not successfully co@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the t@@ mp file and the target calendar are not what we have included here in the example . have you checked whether you have access to the folder for the temporary files and the target @-@ folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : job 4 is the enco@@ ding of piece 1 in the format MP3 . thus take place read and code simultaneously . notice the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration settings to lower this behavior . the only thing is configur@@ able , the number of con@@ current processes to read and code . with powerful machines , the result is un@@ clear . the machine used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 appears to have no problem with the simultaneous read and code ( however two different pieces ) to have .
now the last song is read , while another piece is co@@ ded and a third order in the queue of the co@@ di@@ er@@ ers stands . after the last piece is co@@ ded , a small window will be built with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ ences ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate comp@@ ressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the code of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ ences ; will chat today within the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S as part of the k@@ acy media package . however , you can already include a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ ences ; one part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . install the package k@@ dem@@ ul@@ tiv@@ media from your distribution . if you read this , you probably have done it already ...
this section is aimed at persons using HTML files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs when it once runs , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs , has many variations in settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen photos of the different boxes of settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked after the first time of the program , without any cl@@ ue as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially when at the time of the program vers no audio CD ; in drive ) , or from the unusual short menu ?
what this is about ? who read this , probably has already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it &apos;s as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ ences ; thought it may be . at least only after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore agreed with this proposal .
strange , if you managed to fetch the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these informations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others he did not have real @-@ time @-@ time and kar@@ ao@@ ke @-@ real @-@ time testing of texts also some features that will not have other &amp; Unix ; -@@ MIDI players won &apos;t have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und project distributor , which is needed for G@@ us . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supported a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with altern@@ ating color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI @-@ channel due to high@@ lighting of the pressing buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so you can go to &amp; k@@ de ; each MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window onto the Mid .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( rec@@ ess events or tex@@ ter@@ events ) . K@@ Mid automatically determines the procedure used .
seat support . if you end &amp; k@@ de ; finish a song starts , the Mid starts again with the same song again next time .
supports external MIDI @-@ synth@@ esizer , A@@ we , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P drivers and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you can choose the desired song .
you can also drop a file by a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window drop . this also works with several songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and bet@@ s the button absor@@ b in the tool@@ bar , select the item playing out of the menu piece or enter the empty paste .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts , once you draw it on the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window drag . ( if multiple pieces are added to a collection and then re@@ played in one another . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece plays , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and cycle with the shelf .
if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows to the left and to the right of the template . to get back the original speed , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the leaf c@@ aste has two tasks : when a piece is performed , a pressure on the button break , like a pressure on the button break or the selection of the menu entry into the menu , then inter@@ rup@@ ts the play . bet@@ tering the leaf c@@ aste while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the play@@ back .
lyrics can be stored on two species in a piece of music . some pieces are using Tex@@ ter@@ eig@@ nis , others use lyrics , and another both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set which events are to be presented and even better : the event sty@@ ling will automatically determine which a song will be used . if so , in the menu settings , settings will be selected automatically by the kar@@ ao@@ ke text , but you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other type .
if you want to set up an event type , select from the menu settings the entries of text events or songs events . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you summar@@ ize . these are played the series according to play . in this section you are able to use collections effectively .
to create a collection , open first the collectors group . you will find them in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... click there on New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on cop@@ ying and specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one .
if you have more than a collection , you can adjust the g@@ aps in collectors .
in the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when using the application , this collection does not be stored . raise the if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collectors &apos; camp . there , you can add a song using the button below . it appears in turn , the file dialog , with which help you can choose the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the setup automatic add to the collection .
if automatic addition to the collection is activated , a piece of opening ( under the use of file openings or drag &amp; drop ) automatically added to the active collection .
when automatic add to the collection is not activated , the opening of a piece is the temporary collection activated and pun@@ ches . this collection will then continue to be added to the included pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the StÃ¤@@ del@@ schule collection , select the collection and the desired song and then click away .
you can select the order in which the songs are shown . if you select the series following the sub @-@ menu pop@@ ups of the menus , the songs are shown in the order , as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or remove or random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collectors &quot; collection , or use the listing list above the kar@@ ao@@ ke text .
to jump on a song , select the button of next song , the next song from the menu or press the arrow to the right .
to jump off a song , select the button pre@@ dest@@ ined piece , the entry previous piece of the menu pieces , or press the button on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collectors &quot; collection , select there the ext@@ ingu@@ ishing collection and click on the button Clear .
the temporary collection can not be deleted . however , this doesn &apos;t matter because they are under the leaving of &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored .
this is absolutely necessary for synth@@ esizer which are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI @-@ events in events that synth@@ esizer the synth@@ esizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ map , which conver@@ ts all events of the Type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in Events of the Change Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et , and thus getting a trumpet , if originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound@@ card , you do not need any MIDI map , because all sound@@ cards are GM -@@ compatible ( including A@@ we - and CIS cards , FM radio devices and so on ) .
unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . so you have to edit the corresponding file from hand ( using your favourite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file , which stores all required parameters for the play of a piece of piece .
each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section that may appear as often as desired . a prerequisite for this is that every appearance has a different text ID ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... END Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; name of the key@@ map ... &quot; END Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further key@@ map ... &quot; END Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... END options ... END
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for options ) and END that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I can provide in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support may provide for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI compliant .
in this section the pat@@ ches of General MIDI are shown on your specific keyboard . general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the equation is ignored . it is thought that the GM seeds are available in the right sequence ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all the notes that this instrument need to put on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard , for example does not support gun barrels ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which are similar to a gun powder . add the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( Win ) , it takes patch 100 ( the Drum on your keyboard ) and plays tone 60 , regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the concept of Drum patch the patch is meant that every sound is a different perception tool ( drum , basin , Mar@@ acas &amp; etc ; ) and is not the one to which the tone means the tone of the always same drum . ( like him some key@@ boards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to indicate how sounds are shown on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you need to create 128 entries .
you can use multiple key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key@@ boards are used primarily to convert tones to the Per@@ k@@ ens@@ lip channel . watch yourself as an example the included key@@ maps .
this section can be used to im@@ pose some channels to others . if you want to exchange the first and second channel , simply get in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the per@@ c on a specific channel ( General MIDI to channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
Midi @-@ GerÃ¤te need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section therefore has 16 lines , number@@ ed from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
n ist der Canal , which is shown on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map will need to be defined in the file name . if you &apos;re using the For@@ ce@@ Patch Option , all events will be ignored and are trying to change the patch on this canal . in this case , then patch is always used .
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful for example to always use the per@@ c @-@ resistant patch on the per@@ c channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ Rati@@ o indicates that the relationship Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender events will be multip@@ lied with the value n , this with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) is calculated and then only convey@@ ed . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file no dec@@ im@@ al@@ ones are standing ) .
this setting is needed because GM indicates that a keyboard , which should play a pit@@ cher event with the value 40@@ 96 , a tone higher . unfortunately , however , try some key@@ boards around two notes up to an oc@@ t@@ ave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; try it down .
to use a MIDI @-@ map , just open the dialog MIDI @-@ settings . you can find this in the menu under Settings , point MIDI @-@ settings
the Kan@@ al@@ view is a window with a whole series of piano ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ anos you can see which sounds are just played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list , where you can choose an instrument , the kno@@ b is no longer green but red , to indicate that no more the original instrument is used .
the Kan@@ al@@ view has ( until now ) two different views to view the played notes . the view can be displayed in the Settings menu under the point channel view : settings
the speed @-@ LCD shows the speed with which a song is performed . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . therefore , if you find , a song is too fast , to follow the text , you can slow down . to change the pace , use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that has to be played on how a piece of music must be played . it contains the notes , the speed , speed , &amp; etc . . this allows the same MIDI file to perform two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians play the same notes in a very different way .
well , I can force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs around 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a comp@@ ression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synth@@ esizer you get a similar sound quality . if a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything .
this may happen if you have a bin@@ ary distribution ( r@@ pm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; don &apos;t have that happen because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ we support was compiled to remove the issue you need to download a source of distribution and install ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos; s start@@ page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all the files individually .
dis@@ agree , therefore support &amp; k@@ mid ; Dra@@ g &amp; Drop . open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files and drag them onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
previously you activate the settings automatic to add to the collection . otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can taste the arrows icon at the left from Tem@@ po@@ - LCD , to slow the play@@ back . to restore the standard tempo , you can double click on the LCD screen .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; working space a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; if I want to play a MIDI file or I want to play a file , simply move into the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window change and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; draw .
if you want to listen to a file a file without adding them equal to a collection , you turn to adjust to an automatic add to the collection and the new ; a file is added to the temporary collection .
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first , you only want to play the first file . so make your settings automatic add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then un@@ lock yourself , including B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid to play and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . all the heart@@ felt thanks ! if I hear these songs or the postcard watch , anim@@ ates me to set on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez . in the moment I &apos;m written in the third year , so that I don &apos;t have much time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to collect myself a bit of time . as Hob@@ bies I have programming , MIDI files , make music and propos@@ itions .
if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ ao@@ ke files , or even if you want to make me happy , send me an email : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really do a huge pleasure if you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ ao@@ ke file from a local group . if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will contact me by friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but if you want to send me a MIDI file , you should contact me since I already have the file .
I have en@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and by anyone who k@@ issed money for this . I would therefore want to empha@@ size that I only continue with this program@@ er because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. BÃ¼h@@ ler - Beh@@ ind the bug that was high at A@@ we @-@ cards .

and of course , my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians on the net , who give us this wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ ao@@ ke files .
in addition , you can find under ht@@ tp : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .ht@@ ml . on the homepage you can track the development and look at pictures . you will also find links to sites with further kar@@ ao@@ ke songs , etc . ;
a sound@@ card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synth@@ esizer , as the sound quality depends on your sound@@ card . it &apos;s not the same if you use a FM @-@ device or an A@@ we card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you would have a sound card , unless you can hear any music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player is a simple interface for M@@ player , ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ pe@@ g . the program is used to play video files of those of M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as for playing DVD &apos;s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for the c@@ app@@ name ; it was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
for additional help please check the page The KDE Website for new versions or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user Mail@@ ing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . either there is the window with the play@@ list . and finally there is an information window that only then appears when information is displayed .
it is possible to pick up the preferred connections under the book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played to each other , so you should use the category S@@ igh@@ ty play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarch@@ ies , his group and all its sub @-@ groups is copied and the play@@ back starts with the indicated entry .
the categories &apos; aktu@@ elles &apos; , television and thum@@ b play@@ list can also be changed by direct edit the XML configuration files . naturally , you can only do that if &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; not running through an editor , but also by application itself . simply click on a name of a category cli@@ cked on the menu view and the next editing mechanism . by the cli@@ pping of a sub @-@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , must be selected from the menu with play@@ list and select either the editing module , or be selected to another category .
all changes are lost if the processing mo@@ dus leave or another group will be chosen without the play@@ list .
owing to the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be swit@@ ched by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during star@@ ten and finishing can be disabled by the edit of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and Change by &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be simply inserted .
it is also possible to activate a different animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / p / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ / / share / p / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during star@@ ters need not be short , it will automatically termin@@ ate by opening another source . this would be annoying at the end @-@ animation , however , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favorite pictures ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; In the source Package by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are in the directory tests / some examples of sm@@ il die of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a rider to the configuration of M@@ Player in the configur@@ ations dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here the path can be adjusted from the M@@ Player and the intermediate size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troub@@ les@@ ho@@ oting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player visi@@ bly .
there is no rider for this play@@ unit in the configur@@ ations dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be con@@ figured out by manual work of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ bl@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is installed :
&apos; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted in the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the play@@ list XML .
thus the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages can be re@@ displayed , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player must be displayed as a service provider for the MI@@ ME type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the import@@ ation of KDE listed .
the con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is in a con@@ soles application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library . if there is no mistakes , the back@@ end output is inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) .
so that always a blu@@ ep@@ rint for a particular MI@@ ME type is taken ( of course only when this was also identified ) , this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ bl@@ c . for example , ph@@ one@@ on all og@@ g files again :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play from TV cards , either using mo@@ player or X@@ Video ( this takes k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be con@@ figured , this is used to be used to use device and the TV channels . this can be used manually the scanner from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be manually edited manually .
for Con@@ figuration of V@@ DR ( Video data Rec@@ order ) settings in k@@ m@@ player is the dialog in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ elle@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port to use . there should be detected ports to be selected ( e.g. , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DVB in this .
since the V@@ DR can take advantage of k@@ m@@ player only X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( most likely , this type of play video will be working on Linux . this is why the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension to work for the X server should therefore be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
intern is used by K@@ M@@ Player for sources different names . at the time of the creation of this documentation , this d@@ vd@@ nav@@ source , int@@ ros@@ ource , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , ur@@ l@@ source , vc@@ d.@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they begin with the play@@ list of play@@ list .
are there hints as I can make my CD@@ ROM drive down when I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ E 8 / dev / CD@@ ROM must run as user root after inser@@ ting the device . it is absolutely sure that / dev / CD@@ ROM shows on the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine only starts slowly , why does my CPU need to be tested on their performance each time ?
note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ l k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

with automatic transm@@ issions the environments is created by entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically a space line ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be activated in the menu . ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; grant the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the box and sub@@ set the lowest element ) :
in the view of the document in the structural view , the single elements can be changed and seen by a mouse click on the respective models .
in creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful , jumps &amp; c@@ ile . once a DVI ; -@@ file &#91; framed B ) jump &amp; c@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer for the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code .
a DVI ; -@@ file contained a description of the format document and other information such as font . or &amp; lat@@ ex ; and there are many tools to view , conversion and print out of DVI ; -@@ files for various systems and co@@ ats .
when using the return device , the elements of DVI ; -@@ file is loaded with the editor and once on a item in the DVI ; -@@ source code has been coated , the exact opposite of it . once upon a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; the code has been cli@@ cked , the corresponding location in the DVI ; -@@ viewer will s@@ lick .
Master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other integrated .@@ tex files will be simpli@@ fied . when using a project , a project @-@ wide Master document can be adjusted to project project settings .
quick : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result automatically appears ( if no error in the source code are presented ) .
fil@@ esi@@ ze : in this mode , the DVI ; -@@ file on Ã &quot; n@@ der@@ un@@ Ã¢ s , Ã Â¼ ber@@ wach@@ t@@ Ã¢ , and there is no call for &amp; oc@@ ular : after screening .
in viewing the be@@ ware of the tool@@ bar , the three gro@@ Ã Â¢ bles en sel@@ ections should be stri@@ cken . the initial selection field has been developed for rapidly import of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The trans@@ itory &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the division are :
the selection field Other is for the addition of articles such as tags , Fu@@ zhou notes or notes . the following possibilities are :
name : with this command a name for a section , a picture or other element is created .
reference : will be used for reference to a festive design@@ ation ( selection to a selection field ) .
when using c@@ itation there is a selection list with liter@@ ary entry . for the work of &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files are corresponding editors , and the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand .
the last drop @-@ box with the name Gr@@ Ã Â¶ Ã© e is used for determining the ty@@ pe@@ writer , for the main text , the FU@@ LL notes etc . there are the following fon@@ ts :
when calling &amp; c@@ ile ; two choices are available : 1 . the assistant for the preparation of a new document by selecting the document types and cut@@ ters . 2 . the document may be written down by hand .
the br@@ ack@@ ets for the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ ate contain the settings for the command . the attitude &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; lays the writer &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; , the writing is not set at the beginning , this can also happen spont@@ ane@@ ously in the text .
once the above source code has been given , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code must be compiled . the sim@@ pl@@ est way of this is the use of the MEN@@ U &apos;s building or bone quick structure .
the code must be saved in front of the comp@@ iling . &amp; c@@ ile ; for the storage is automatically saved .
schl@@ Ã Â¤ fies the comp@@ iling of the document f@@ law@@ l , should be sear@@ ched in recording according to the errors . if using quick@@ structure , &amp; oc@@ ular should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the recording should also be applied .
a environment ( en@@ see environment ) is a text that will be treated differently from the rest@@ ful document . for example , a report with the writing process is supposed to have a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ end { environment } expi@@ res so@@ far the Ã Â¼ n@@ oses of the writing @-@ grass roots within the area ( en@@ see HU@@ GE ) .
the cuts are only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no circum@@ cis@@ ions ( number ) for the cuts within an environment .
there are many possibilities to brigh@@ ten the read@@ ability and usability of the document . there are e.g. certain fon@@ ts , li@@ abilities , cur@@ s@@ ant , sub@@ missions , etc. are added . these commands either end with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ sive and is long as long as it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be presented with \ \ emp@@ h { word } ital@@ ic .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { rate } and ends with \ \ end { rate } .
after the background to writing the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ recording session was shown , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for the creation of a document in &amp; c@@ ile ;
once in assist@@ ants a bit of text was given , a few adjustments for the better legi@@ bility of the document should be accomplished . in this case , a quot@@ ation , a few places in the fat and cur@@ sive and a poem comes to the application to see the differences of these commands .
once the document was seen , using editor &apos;s view or Str@@ g E can be used again to the editor ( with internal viewers ) . in an external viewer , its windows must be closed .
once the DVI ; the file was created , the document can be printed or used in a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file will be converted . simply try and Spa@@ ak .
DVI ; is a structured file format ( Engl . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for reading the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ Um@@ wand@@ ler or Computer@@ bild .
for the printing a &amp; DVI ; -@@ file are the same steps as for the preparation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can be printed ( if the printer is right ) .
the tool@@ bar form the conversion of DVI ; -@@ file in other formats . once the DVI ; -@@ file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code was created , the conversion into certain other formats can begin using the tool@@ bar .
the precau@@ tion p@@ light the direct jump from editor to per@@ ish position inside the DVI ; -@@ file .
&amp; c@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; bin@@ aries . this is only necessary to integrate modern under settings medication ... tools B@@ auen balanced .
to re@@ locate the precau@@ tion , the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor in a row of the source text , and as@@ le@@ ep on Vor@@ w@@ Ã Â¤ r@@ ts@@ search . the jump to the corresponding location in the DVI ; the viewer will take place .
with this function in &amp; oc@@ ular , with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document of &amp; c@@ ile ; attached and to the appropriate line . you have to set up &amp; c@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; as the text editor will be specified ( Settings Ok@@ ular ... Editor )
if in case of sc@@ aff@@ ing the &amp; DVI ; the viewer should not be Ã Â¶ ff@@ ed , there may be a mistake . should be a mistake , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window .
the proto@@ cols file cl@@ an@@ ed the error source in source . in the Editor , there are always the line where the error appears . in order to view the faul@@ ty line , the error must be cli@@ cked on the faul@@ ty line , and must be cli@@ cked on the faul@@ ty line ; jump to the faul@@ ty line .
once on the corresponding kno@@ b in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to choose the template for the template for the document .
when selecting single document , a document can be written from scratch or the assistant for a quick creation of a new document . more information can be included in the section .
ugly users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for nearly all documents . templates can be created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , you must create an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; -@@ file must be created or create a new file . &amp; c@@ ile ; can create a new template using an existing document and selection of document templates .
when creating a new document , a template used by file new will be replaced by other data ( such as name or character enco@@ ding ) . these variables can be set up in settings bugs . settings are set up .
when creating your own template , it is imperative to know which fon@@ ts are replaced by which variable :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLASS@@ OPTI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering in document class . typically they are used as follows : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLASS@@ OPTI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of assist@@ ants and the instructions of the commands in the editor . once the document was created in this way , the following steps have been completed :
when creating a new document , its own template can be balanced instead of default value .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; process files will be created a simple way to create a template , should be sear@@ ched for one on the Internet and the steps described below .
&amp; c@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( including also &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for that you can directly out of &amp; c@@ ile ;

many wi@@ z@@ ants can be included in the window . these are a separate type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu features , or the corresponding key@@ boards , so that it is empha@@ sized at the first input of a string automatically .
finding a program is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; c@@ ile ; and though &amp; Kate is added ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code was added . &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection . among editing them , the following commands are included in the text selection :
w@@ Ã Â¤ h@@ lt a complete paragraph ( group of lines contained on both sides ( like in other text files ) . this advanced importance as@@ le@@ ep with it with tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of source code . the only explo@@ iting cause is in &amp; k@@ ile ; therefore , that the s@@ cour@@ sing is separated by two blank lines .
wake up the word under the current Cur@@ sor@@ ption position . this selection also has an advanced meaning as this command also &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a return surface ( \ \ ) and a given star ( * ) at the end fails .
for the spo@@ on of a part of the document , this first appeared off and by pressing the button de@@ f . &amp; Kate ; offers the whole row removed . &amp; c@@ ile ; offers with its own commands , the following commands may contain the following commands :

it was already clar@@ ified that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore offers &amp; c@@ ile ; add more commands to working environment for a powerful work with &amp; lat@@ ex ;
with this command at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor will be placed directly in front of the command to prepare the area .
with this command will be swit@@ ched to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor will be placed directly behind the command to the chim@@ ney in the area .
if the cur@@ sor in front or within the command \ \ begin { surroundings } is found at the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
in the entry of many mer@@ ging environmental commands can be quickly lost sight . this command as@@ le@@ ep the last seen surrounding area , so that the event@@ ual environment structure is not re@@ ign@@ ited .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups , which are determined by br@@ ack@@ ets { ... } . under Be@@ es Te@@ X @-@ Group are a few important commands , to which comply with the environment .
with this command at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor will be placed directly in front of the cur@@ ves cl@@ amp .
with this command at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor will be placed directly behind the cur@@ ved br@@ ack@@ ets .
if the cur@@ sor before or behind the cur@@ ly cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is , becomes the other end of the group ( or vice @-@ versa ) .
in the entry of many wel@@ ded groups @-@ br@@ ack@@ ets can be lost quickly the Ã Â¼ ber@@ ish view dar@@ ing . this command as@@ le@@ ep the last seen group , so the screw@@ ed structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups does not cr@@ ush .

this automatic entry of the double beg@@ in@@ sig@@ nia can set up in settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X - and sign@@ posted .
it can also use isolated settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) , and thus German or fran@@ z@@ Ã Â¶ s@@ ical beginnings . there are also many other languages available .
at the Dr@@ Ã Â¼ cken by Shift ; Rhin@@ oplast@@ ics , a smart row break . if the current position is located within a lists -@@ environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , for example , not only a row break , but also the command \ \ item .

even better - &amp; c@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to accommodate bi@@ ased &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom @-@ defined environments . this can be introduced among settings .
some users prefer the columns in tables -@@ environments and all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; k@@ ile ; try this to@@ ile . if this tab@@ ulator , lacking in the next door , for the next door , for the columns of the current tab@@ ulator .
although Ther@@ m ; already has a good source of code , it was installed in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands ( usually for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) again . these are three according to the need and the other two are for automatic transm@@ issions . all these modes can be adjusted for different work@@ ings in settings .
when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { surroundings } , &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { surroundings } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
at the bottom of the return @-@ taste , the last letter is removed from entering and allow it to fold the comprehen@@ sion list . on the other hand , the list can also be resi@@ zed by entering another letter .
all commands will be written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed from a command . alternatively , jumping stamp will be noted , so that a simply jump to these positions by means can be possible jumping stamp N@@ Ã Â¤ ch@@ ste spr@@ ing@@ mar@@ ke can be used .
among settings k@@ ile ; inv@@ ent ... c@@ ile ; sub@@ st@@ ating settings to these lists are made . there are different winding lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as anger of common language .
the command mode is to be inserted a few letters with \ \ begin and the call of transl@@ ating mo@@ dus will have a gross list of ambient no@@ des . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the comprehen@@ sion of the environments .
when it comes to complete suspic@@ ious typ@@ ist , the fe@@ ed@@ ent con@@ gest@@ ion of Alt + Shift key , the command becomes in@@ consistent and it appears \ \ begin . after that , the ambient lighting can be carried out in the sim@@ pl@@ est manner and by pressing the input button .
after this is accomplished , the environment will be automatically closed again . once &amp; c@@ ile ; realize that it is a lists setting , is even a first \ \ item command with penet@@ rated .
among settings k@@ ile ; setup ... c@@ ile ; sub@@ st@@ ating settings to these lists are made . this mode used the win@@ der war@@ ri@@ ment of the comp@@ lies Sec@@ tor &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; c@@ ile ; designed user @-@ defined lists of in@@ can be replaced immediately using char@@ geable character chains . as an example of an in@@ fir@@ ing list , the file is ex@@ amp@@ le@@ .c@@ w@@ l , in which for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the letter L has been assigned to the letter L and the word comprehen@@ sively introduced and the fe@@ eds of Str@@ g + Alt Le@@ ert@@ aste , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
Gro@@ Ã Â¶ r@@ ter@@ b@@ Ã Â¼ vers are not useful for automatic comp@@ ressing measures . however , it was noted that many wo@@ unds in a document are more than once written . this offers &amp; c@@ ile ; it offers all already written water @-@ written .
this mode can set up in the MEN@@ SI@@ ONS K@@ ile ... K@@ ile ampli@@ fied st@@ agn@@ ation . here can also be defined by the sw@@ elling for the display of the comprehen@@ sion .
the comp@@ ressed files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / p / k@@ ile / complete / mode / of the Persian home folder . mode stands for ab@@ brevi@@ ation ( Ab@@ brevi@@ ation book ) or tex .
the dialog graphics are designed to cover the layout of graphics as simple as possible . in determining the fundament@@ als of the graphics and graphics should be observed and observed .
PS -@@ files are not as known as PDF -@@ files , but provide an excellent basis for the registration and re@@ fac@@ tions of pages . will be applied the pages with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools newly arranged and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
in order to be able to watch the result of the work , the source must be compiled , according to the source code . all components are group@@ ed into the scope of creating comp@@ iling , creating and creating summary .

the name and email entries are self @-@ explaining . nickname is the user name of the user and serves as clear identification .
one member may have several roles in the project , such as both team@@ leader and sub@@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and put the button replace than pus@@ h@@ are . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears to be named after you are : text .
the nickname and setting of their own identity are important in terms of news and notes . see for more information on comments .
besides the overview of their team there is another advantage by the capture of the members of the team : it can be an event to get information to the team@@ leader when something happens . see in for further information .
event actions are actions that will be executed when something specific in the project occurs . an example would be able to record the opening of opening and closing of the project , so how much someone worked to it , or sending a message that a file is backed up to CV@@ S once it is added to the project , etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings , these events can be created , edited and deleted .
an E@@ Mail will be sent to the address in the recipient list selected ad@@ ress . the address can be a team@@ - or Sub@@ project leader . see in where such leaders will be set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
enter comments is simple . it can be either selected the note record from the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary box followed by the text ext@@ text .
notes can be made a sti@@ ble member of the team . in this case , the syn@@ tax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( Rolle ) , the role played a role in the project consisting of the following possibilities : team leader in Sub@@ project leaders should be introduced to the corresponding area or sub@@ project names , as stated in the following examples below .
nickname and roles @-@ names are independent of large or small @-@ chec@@ ker , but spaces around the br@@ aces and the : make the note sp@@ read@@ ed .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and form@@ att@@ ing languages , the D@@ TD @-@ agno@@ stic is and web@@ based formats and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here you will be treated only via &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings , a short description for the others can be found .
the settings can be set up by settings Qu@@ anta . Dies@@ er@@ Dialog extends over some pages that will be treated succ@@ essi@@ vely .
the behaviour of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; concerning tags including rent @-@ understanding can be changed thus . the entries are :
large / small @-@ preci@@ ation of tags : large / small @-@ prescription from automatic inserted tags . normal large / small @-@ preci@@ ation means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / min@@ ut@@ ment of attributes : large / small @-@ preci@@ ation of attributes . normal wholes@@ ale / small @-@ preci@@ ation means the attributes are so inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if raised , is optional for tags , for which the final day is optional , this immediately follows the bed .
do not include optional tags : like above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
start and ending day automatically update : if swit@@ ched , the corresponding set will be changed and vice @-@ versa .
automatic sub@@ set of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding co@@ ding during the typ@@ ing .
MI@@ ME types : Mim@@ et@@ yp@@ s to detect different types of files . using the button standard , the default privileg@@ es can be restored .
standard report enco@@ ding : the co@@ ding of newly created or used in a different way than with file opening open files ( where the co@@ ding of the file can be passed ) , but this setting here is out of the same in the project features , if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD will be used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD was not recognized , but this setting here is out of the same in the project features , if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regular backup copies , so that with a black@@ out or crash when the next start of the program can be recovered from this backup , it &apos;s not the same as the stor@@ ing of the file . even for not stored documents a backup is regularly created , according to the time created .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Ed@@ it@@ or@@ field or in their own view ( or the documentation in a box ) , which makes it possible to see the documentation , the preview and the source text at the same time .
replace the window settings at the standard starting next start is useful when the user interface with changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views through each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command parameters .
the warning @-@ off area serves the control of the possibility to in@@ qu@@ ire the ad of war@@ nings by ho@@ oks of non @-@ in@@ qu@@ ire .
the place for the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change . it can be defined by symbols instead of scripts , just as the synchron@@ ization of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source text in the tag@@ ged mode . in terms of the different modes , see .
here the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the illustration of the Par@@ ser @-@ knot@@ s in the document to be adjusted in details .
in the case of mouse @-@ click on the structural baum , the following action is possible to change the action by clicking the structural tree with the mouse @-@ necessary action .
in the area of structural tree settings the visibility of k@@ not in the tree , the actu@@ aliz@@ ations of the building , and how deep in changing the structural tree will be automatically open . empty No@@ des are the empty areas in the text , whereas empty groups such are found in which the current document is not found an item .
the area for the soli@@ dation of ab@@ brevi@@ ations ( a kind of templates ) that can be tr@@ un@@ fol@@ ds on extensive use . ab@@ brevi@@ ations are valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s may be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can exist , it can be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ cl@@ ause ab@@ brevi@@ ation is something different than in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plug @-@ ins are managed . plugins are K@@ Part @-@ App@@ lications of third @-@ page , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ capable application , at the most known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . in inser@@ ting a plug @-@ ins the following must be stated :
address : the path to the plugin , if it is not located at a standard flat as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information is handed over to the plugin for the start , so it can open the current file ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
component in &quot; Just read &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in is denied the shop . only read @-@ the Parts usually refuse the shop , if this option is not selected .
re@@ ass@@ ed the plug @-@ in : is this enabled , then test@@ et &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; whether the given information is correct . pick the plug @-@ in also if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the troub@@ les@@ ho@@ oting was completely new . Die@@ Support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was adjusted , as well as support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead of it became a de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ plug @-@ in concept , which allows various implement@@ ations of plug @-@ ins .
currently only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ quant@@ ap@@ lus ; included .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a proper de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ ins in the project settings . with the button options next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger @-@ Plugin sel@@ ections can change the specific settings .
if for a project a de@@ bu@@ gger activ@@ ates , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ user interface :
a view where the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view where all holding points are listed , line numbers and conditions are usually listed . usually it appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if required , or she shares the plug @-@ in with , on de@@ bu@@ zz@@ lement . this action is being executed by default when a project is opened , that a de@@ bu@@ gger is not used , so that it is not necessary to notice a de@@ bu@@ gger .
the counter@@ part to debug meeting starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the lau@@ gh of requirements .
send a HTTP server request to the server to submit a debug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to watch the current document . the issue of this requirement is displayed in the view de@@ bu@@ gger issue .
points the de@@ bu@@ gger , begin with the execution of the script and information about the surveillance variables as well as the currently exec@@ uting line . if this happens while the script is attached , the execution continues , before a debut requirement was started , the script starts with the requirement .
points the de@@ bu@@ gger , to begin with the execution of the script , without information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens when a script has been hal@@ ted , the execution continues , the execution starts as soon as a requirement is placed .
the de@@ bu@@ gger guides the next directive to enter the script without limitation to the functions or applications .
the de@@ bu@@ gger guides the next directive on the script , whereby if possible in functions and includes fail .
shows the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the instruction and go to the next so if there is no current one .
opens a dialog , in which a variable or an expression may be given to super@@ vised . the super@@ vised value appears in the variation view .
this dialog may be given a variable or a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how you and quant@@ ap@@ lus ; adapt to your needs and how you and quant@@ ap@@ lus ; can help better become better .
Doc@@ umentation type Ed@@ iti@@ er@@ pak@@ ete ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) will be in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to give support for Mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; to provide your simplicity and flexibility . your simplicity and flexibility is made of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the flag@@ ship languages and family 2 , the script languages and the tool@@ bar . day folder includes two file types , the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ on file ) , the text and instructions can insert faster into a document as a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see in for details on conversion .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bar . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attribute for tags as well as the layout and contents of the peculi@@ ar catalogue ; the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bar enable a quick inser@@ tion of tags into a document without danger of a writing fault .
tag folders are nothing but folder . you only contain the des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carry the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html _ 4.01 @-@ mode )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML on and declar@@ ing whether they are necessary or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible so other users have a better idea and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes every element in detail . everything about the possibilities and borders is presented in a simple way .
this is the root element of an Tag@@ XML document . it can occur only once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as a only element type over itself nothing else .
the type of tags is a script feature . when using it , att@@ r &gt; a argument of function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the t@@ ear@@ type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type method there is the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attributes , and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialogue . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ Day is determined . this is a only element type element .
describes an attribute of a tags . this item can occur only once for each attribute . in addition , there are other tags , descri@@ bing how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a single element -@@ type element .
prints the source texts used for the attributes in the day @-@ Ed@@ it@@ or@@ dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; becomes used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p @-@ Metho@@ den@@ name within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a stroke and a name name . the arguments that are transferred to the method . can be empty or % day @-@ name % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container day the elements of a list together group@@ ed together . it can occur for one attribute , only once . it is a only @-@ element type element .
defines the position of the attribute of a tags within a dialogue system . this day can occur for each attribute in a dialogue only once ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the item is empty .
specify the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be available for each field in the dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Day ) . this item is empty .
prints a list of elements that may occur within the specific tags . this item is a single element type .
specify a list of elements that end a day . this item is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; -@@ De@@ clear@@ ance begin : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 enco@@ ding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be frozen and closed .
space affect nothing , but pay attention to &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; how @-@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaced ; text &gt; will be eff@@ ected . this will cause no Bein@@ gs effect , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to review the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is to start in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ window to start and aud@@ ited Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to select another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this function is currently not available yet . currently , the review will only be published in charging the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
in the following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes it &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; -@@ item from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ Schema . the fil@@ ename for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ ename of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag .
lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; enco@@ ding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; lt ; day name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ file is just as simple and there is an editor to get accessible via D@@ TD Bear@@ be@@ ite D@@ TD settings . in order to work out a &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = utilize 1 for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; Version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD file . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.01 Trans@@ itional / / EN ) . if not specified , the name is used as nickname .
an action can be set up with settings actions ... created . click new action leads to the same dialogue :
this action ac@@ credited by clicking the button user can be assigned a key@@ boards ; with K@@ one is the current short@@ cuts .
the sim@@ pl@@ est promotions . it can be inserted a text in the detailed settings and in carrying out the action , this text is inserted in the document on the current C@@ ursor position . see the example below .
this is the migh@@ ti@@ est action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually script , but it is not limited ) to change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) ; even the Quick start -@@ dialog or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter must be stated . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified path@@ ade allows , it is advised to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variation in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / p / quant@@ a / share / p / quant@@ a / scripts in their path : $ P@@ ATH It gives other special variable which can be used in the command line :
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in the event of a local document file : / from the document name .
% pid : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ process running . when it runs from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is running , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the external script .
the parameters for this event , normally the fil@@ ename of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above mentioned methods , a script should be advised of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to the standard input . in the selection field you can be determined what is to send to the standard input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document will be sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only useful with this setting .
according to the input data , the output of the exec@@ uting application can be diver@@ ted . there are two types output : normal output , written on the default error messages . it can be specified to the default error written , by which the value is set to the drop @-@ down output :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags in logical groups . in the given case , it is not too many , therefore one can create a tool@@ bar using the name of the market .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you must add actions and configure . select settings actions .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explaining . pressing the new action button at the bottom of the window starts the editing mode .
fill in all the necessary fields and add them to the same tool@@ bar .
complete everything and , if the day attributes , and you are planning to plan their use , activate a dialog &quot; day &quot; when available , so that you can enter an entry when it is possible .
ignor@@ ant ! is this a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? replace it before we face difficulties .
to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; k@@ icon@@ edit . select from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , Grafik Fur@@ ther Programme ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ icon@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose Be@@ es Size andern .
please note that the created icon will not only help you to remember what action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P .
in mind that the day start , I decided to create a start kno@@ b as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually interpreted as being rigi@@ d , rigi@@ d , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user sign@@ aled that clicking on this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start@@ gt ; -@@ tag in the current document will insert .
after creating the symbol , it must still be connected to the promotion . this happens over the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . besides the text box there is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored icon is , select it and confirm with OK .
press the apply button and continue with other tags , so there is still which , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to complement some usual &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ functions to the tool@@ bar , or it should be shared with the better overview by some separ@@ ators in several groups . open the tool@@ bar set up dialogue about settings tool@@ bar . make sure that the tool@@ bar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( very left above ) for my tool@@ bar . after the selection of the element , that is to be added to the tool@@ bar , push the arrow down to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar .
please note , as the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar , could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start @-@ button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by proxy of all symbols to ensure that everything works .
secure you in the right folder . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , there are im@@ regul@@ arities ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please match her &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their tool@@ bar is loaded ( s ) , if a file is opened from the corresponding type .
perhaps the most notable addition of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the opportunity to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ att@@ ing language that you like most . therefore , describes this chapter as I create a &amp; PHP ; document tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory , whether someone has done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you must seek an existing documentation for the form@@ att@@ .net / script / etc . language . then you have to leave the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part we leave you , the second we treat here .
# KDE configur@@ ations file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = Path , relatively to this file , including the document library , e.g. php@@ 42 / # items in the main index top item = your description for this docum@@ ent@@ ations = presently 1 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ in@@ put@@ 1 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html _ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the document tree . for instance , you can see this example in PHP &amp; PHP ; documentation is something :
# KDE Con@@ fig File &#91; tree &#93; Doc dir = php@@ 42 / # top level element = PHP 4.2 , # 4.2 Manual = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting started , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x@@ .ht@@ ml ... Language Reference = Basic syn@@ tax , ... Basic syn@@ tax = langu@@ ag@@ e.@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .ht@@ ml ...
note the # Get@@ ting started and Language Reference . this shows that there is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for chess column ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the content is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and more consequ@@ ential at the top of the Bau@@ man@@ tle &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
space affect nothing , but watch out &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; Res@@ ourc@@ end@@ at@@ eries are replaced .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is to be displayed for the mysq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . by flag@@ ging of function and pres@@ sures of C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context @-@ help the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the cont@@ ext@@ list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file @-@ mandatory lines .
a simple list of comple@@ mented context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c / share / p / quant@@ a / share / p / quant@@ a / doc / p / quant@@ a / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( so as you specified this in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
if you &apos;re confident that this is good and it &apos;s worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation were used to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory for the use by the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . they will not be rich , but proud to be involved in the best web development platform .
with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; are you not alone . it is possible to divide the streams ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bar with campaigns , scripts , styles ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by means of an email to friends , partners or otherwise . at different places there is an email to send menus , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with an email send , in the context menu of files and folders in the Templ@@ ates and scripts in the scripts .
the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all the others &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ users can be downloaded and only available when our team needs them as accurate and beneficial for publication . to take advantage of the resources that it needs a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . there@@ with , the origin of the resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for later user .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for your passport for their private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys you can choose to . in the dialogue New resource , the input cells ( URL can remain empty ) and click OK to load the blast load .
the up@@ loading can upload from the menus D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) to upload , tool@@ bar , and in cont@@ ext@@ menu of files and folders in the Templ@@ ates and scripts .
after downloading a resource , still prior to installation , investig@@ ates &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by exam@@ ining the integrity and Sig@@ nat@@ ing . in the case of problems there is given and the resource is given correctly . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the statement of the resource of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages , which is currently not yet supported by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is necessary to work by creating a D@@ TE@@ P package . however , the creation may be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files in the tag@@ XML format could be necessary . there &apos;s the easiest way to convert an D@@ TD automatically to a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started by the D@@ TD shop and conver@@ gence of a D@@ TD . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description which should be used . then the following dialogue appears :
target @-@ drawn name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / p / quant@@ a / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Defin@@ ition@@ s@@ zeile : the string , which in ! Doc@@ type Day , like HTML PU@@ BLI@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.01 Trans@@ itional / / EN ht@@ tp : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ ml@@ 4 / lo@@ os@@ e.@@ dt@@ d
fine setting of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; after the transformation the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; there are some key concepts . to understand these to understand and get full benefit from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; therefore , one must first bring them to this fundamental concept , without their understanding &amp; quantitative ; little benefits .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the work@@ space divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available to anyone , the &amp; quantitative . utili@@ zation , available . from tool@@ bar about actions it is all that is marked as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; stored . this enables the group of administ@@ rators different tool@@ bar , actions and patterns in the global tree will be available to anyone in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements provide a personal collection of web@@ designs for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and materials . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that it can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to tool@@ bar with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project . simply said , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , making the common use of special tools and patterns of all staff within the project .
the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Ed@@ it@@ or@@ window , den Bau@@ man@@ if@@ s , den Kart@@ ei@@ ern with info and the tool@@ bar . please suggest in , and for further information on these fields .
you can click the boxes with the right mouse button , to obtain an account @-@ menu with the current document , like include the current , other or all boxes , re@@ charging , delete or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ marks or version of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right @-@ click menu in the Ed@@ it@@ or@@ area lead to a further context menu with regard to the editing document , such as basic processing steps ( cutting / copy / paste ) , processing the file under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor or opening the file , if the string is called under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor a file .
at the top of the editors are the tool@@ bar of the editor . currently , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.01 Trans@@ itional als Standard an , for which a set of tool@@ bar is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the tool@@ bar adapted to the new functions and the associated user needs .
the use of tool@@ bar is really easy . if they want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; then click on the symbol that tag the day . now , they can insert the data for this just added day . if they want to insert the data for this just added day . if they want to insert a day that has several attributes ( such as an@@ chor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the buildings ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate in the information &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate and to pass it . in the presentation with cart@@ els stand for files , project , patterns , script structure , scripts , and documentation Bau@@ man@@ views available .
project management is a powerful tool , which provides &amp; quantitative . this view shows all the files in the project and allows the compar@@ ing of files in the project using right mouse click . actions like adding , removal , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from storage media can then be performed with the current context menu .
another way of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole web page &amp; etc . there are options open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on which they are used . the category depends on &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Working range . global styles are always available , local styles only available for the corresponding users and templates in projects are available only in the project .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of fix@@ ing in Global , Local and Project also functions here . by clicking on the right mouse button , you can retri@@ eve the available information about a script . the right mouse button are available , such as the script to start , edit or send it with E@@ Mail .
with this view one shows the internal structure of the active document . by links @-@ clicking a element , the C@@ ursor in the document is set to the position of the element . through the right @-@ click of an element . it opens a list of commands with regards to navigation and refres@@ her the building .
this tree seems to be under the other construction views . with it , some some attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces change . the search tool allows to change all available attributes with a few clicks .
here is the complete documentation for the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; by the quant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; document site can be downloaded , and by adding a folder doc to a project may be added to project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; two boxes leading at the bottom of the window , can be achieved through the beneficial information : the message window and the problem window .
this map provides information about each in Qu@@ anta running script . so , for example , the D@@ TD of the current document used and all changes to the D@@ TD will be shown .
this cardboard box shows all errors in the market up of the current document . &amp; quantitative ; -@@ Scrip@@ ts that are executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bar are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the Chocolate side of the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to define .
another function of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar using E@@ Mail . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; send the tool@@ bar as the comp@@ ressed T@@ ar archive by &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a tool@@ bar in an E@@ Mail , they can safeguard them in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other secure and load !
it is reasonable when you want to adjust the place of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Files to adjust to your system . for this , auto@@ graph provided a number of options that can be transferred to the configure script . to understand a complete list of all options , give . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have trouble downloading &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; have you to verify whether your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 am folder . also , you should ensure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in P@@ ATH before their bin folder . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ;
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web @-@ develop@@ ped tool for the KDE surface . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for a rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a multitude of powerful functions .
while the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; -@@ Editor , the developers began to employ &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , ext@@ end@@ able Mark@@ up @-@ Sprachen Editor ? well , this would make it the absolutely bigger web @-@ develop@@ ped tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML , is &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive Web @-@ development tool . if you can define it in &amp; XML ; define , then should &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this , be the appropriate &amp; IDE .
now , to the above claim to be det@@ ained that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community , which is already developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Ger@@ ma is not only this possible but it allows users and developers , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to expand as they need it for their need .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables web@@ design to boost the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase the productivity dramatically . by means of the program comp@@ iling them &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; expand without getting ir@@ ting a scrip@@ ting language database . ( more about it you find in . )
&amp; quant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web developer environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a rapid web design and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; quant@@ a ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; quant@@ a ; associated with the original developers , the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in detail documentation is associated with help : / quantitative ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or help@@ center help : / quant@@ a execute ) .

a quick access from files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not placed in it , with the oldest entry .
this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use . look in the section templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only an error is reported .
convert into inser@@ ting the cli@@ p@@ board there included special characters to the &amp; HTML ; -@@ cription , so that it is displayed correctly and is not mis@@ understood by the browser as a form@@ att@@ as instruction .
convert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ cription , which is the correct way to inser@@ ting special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the an@@ chor .
split@@ s the block@@ ages off or off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; shift ; taste taste .
goes directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages !
looks for a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expres@@ sions in order to help you .
shows the news window or not . this is the window where you see the ad of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
- and turn on the problem swe@@ eps on the bottom of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem position is activated once you change to the structural tree .
shows the symbol@@ ise left of the main window . this column allows you to put book@@ marks with a single click .
when there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries or next , depending on the position of the C@@ urs@@ ors in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the fil@@ ename of the other documents .
opens an existing project from hard drive . &amp; quantitative ; projects are stored with the file &apos;s turn .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to include files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
searches the project directory according to new files that might be there . this will allow for example to copy graphic files into your project folders or a sub @-@ folder and then add them to the project .
load the files in your project on the server high . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have further inputs / output modules ( KI@@ O slaves ) .
settings , as &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project managed . in the chapter &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects you will find the details explained .
loads of a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project you / tool@@ bar and are only in this menu if you have applied to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must set up using settings actions ... to be added manually or you are asked when you ask the tool@@ bar .
remove a tool@@ bar from the field of view . the del@@ etes does not remove them from the hard disk . if you have not saved the tool@@ bar you are asked if you would like to do it .
so you can send your own material to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ team so that the tool@@ bar exists in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bar on the main server , where anyone can access it . see in .
download one &amp; D@@ TD ; that you have done or ir@@ oning someone else and convert into the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description .
loading / stri@@ pping of the entities of the &amp; D@@ TD ; it makes sense when the entities are from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a writing at the global KDE folder does not exist , fails the shop .
this menu includes a list of tags , which is available in the current tool@@ bar . if the standard is loaded , there are in the tags menu a sub @-@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day entry dialog , if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific under@@ lining .
activated or dis@@ ables the smart inser@@ tion of tags . currently this works only with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent paste means that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this inser@@ ts using the tool@@ bar , if this day contradi@@ cts the rules .

judge the behaviour of the editors . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you will find details .
a dialog appears , in which you can delete entries from the tool@@ bar or to add or change the sequ@@ ences .
this should create an aid in accordance with the context of the mouse cur@@ sor , but it is not yet implemented .
&amp; quantitative , is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project , developers can always need help . if they want to support the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form they find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled best from top to bottom , for example after filling out the project called the whole fil@@ ing structure for the rest of the project automatically comp@@ lements . all these paths and author @-@ information fields can later be adjusted with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project characteristics .
here is the name for the project to enter , for example foo . in entering the name , file is automatically filled out .
this is the name of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Project file . by default , it has the name of the project in small bus@@ hing and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you will find the server address of the machine that you want to access , one , except you can edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ nam@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
lets this field empty , the default settings of the selected proto@@ cols may be used . depending on the adjustment of the remote host , an adjustment may be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , these folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder in which the tool@@ bar can be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bar . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , these folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . it can be selected several files or entire folder .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . at ser@@ ver@@ bal script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc . ) you have to go differently .
cont@@ akt , if files , which are part of the project somewhere in the main folder of the project . if a project is started on new , not an@@ ho@@ oks .
with this option all files and folders are displayed within the root folder and you can make a precise selection of a land@@ fill .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files from the hook or by removing the head , cl@@ ing out of the project .
the final screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be up@@ loaded in the menu with project features in the menu item in the sub@@ window Profile , or change with the short@@ cut shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . additional items will be explained below .
a list of fil@@ ename ( plac@@ eholder is possible ) which will be re@@ read by project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
supple@@ mentary option on the top , also files which are listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when opening the project . in can read more about project views .
this allows the requested de@@ bu@@ gger selected . currently , only Gub@@ ed will be supported . more information about Gub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set with the options button . in the de@@ bu@@ g@@ ging is described .
in the sub @-@ window profiles can be adjusted high la@@ de@@ profile ( see in ) , as well as display a building view for the content of the server for each profile , by drawing up an own layout for each profile .
in the sub @-@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see in the details .
in the sub @-@ window event , you can switch event actions and add or delete these actions . event actions are executed when a previously mentioned event occurs , such as the sick@@ ness of a file . see into the details .
by default , it opens and quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project , which was open . this behavior cannot be influenced by now .
to open a different project , select Project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . same happens when you load a new project .
project management gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files in the current project can be managed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; folder : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are also lack of entries and opening with ... in with the right mouse button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; read@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu : &quot; &quot; &quot;
here you can choose different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the upload files . see .
allows the removal of the current profile . if only more a profile is present , the button ab@@ geb@@ l@@ ends to prevent the removal .
the password is kept in memory and forget about programming . this possibility is useful when common up@@ loading files is necessary and the more uns@@ afe password on the record -@@ option does not come into question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog until you change your opinion prior to the up@@ loading .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; many high profile profiles can be up@@ loaded , and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded on different servers . when working or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server that is to be copied to the files . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address function .
the trans@@ cript protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed KI@@ O slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not need to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port .
depending on your att@@ acking sound , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it according to your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it can not be easy to read , but everyone can see with programming .
a project view is just one set of files and tool@@ bar . it can be used in a project a lot of views , i.e. by simply changing the view can be loaded multiple files and tool@@ bar and replace the currently selected files and tool@@ bar .
views can be accessed in the menu project or the project @-@ tool@@ bar , accessible via settings tool@@ bar @-@ tool@@ bar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; with whom to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows modification of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to the own working method .
as mentioned above are the tool@@ bar in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; best embro@@ i@@ dered by the menu tool@@ bar . use and adding are different . adding the tool@@ bar is treated down in the section Protection of tool@@ bar .
the tool@@ bar and the symbols can be adjusted either by means of the context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , other actions such as the tool@@ bar , remove the tool@@ bar , or tool@@ bar , can be specified in the dialog , where the actions can be displayed on this or other tool@@ bar .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries are also removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bar and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tool@@ bar ... and settings actions can be set .. adjusted .
templates are in essential docum@@ ent@@ as , code cut@@ lets and files to short@@ p . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; used as a basic file system with an independent organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , or any existing folder in the pre @-@ layer tree . templates have in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the limitations one provides for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; mit@@ ig@@ ated templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions presented at the beginning of each template , prior to use .
Bin@@ Ã¤r is all that is not pure text . it can be every file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; bin@@ ary templates are usually included in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g src = / src / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the sub@@ store tree under global styles . further information on the Templ@@ ates tree is available .
documents can be created from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . you usually makes a simple framework for the purpose and organising the work in appropriate way to efficiently be found . some examples may be found in the store tree under global styles . see in for more information on the Templ@@ ates tree .
this kind of templates is useful when not a new document is based on a template but the same text area again and again inserted in the documents . you can find everything from a comment on an end@@ note up to a complete flow system on Javascript or Perl . some examples are available in the store tree under global styles . see in for more information on the Templ@@ ates tree .
as the name says , these templates stand for whole web sites as templates . they are a collection of different documents that can be organized in a folder structure , founded in a comp@@ ressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ;
create a document structure to Bel@@ i@@ eben ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and save the file as templates ...
once this has happened , you notice that ( even if it is stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the sub@@ tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click on file When you store your choice as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily drawn with pul@@ ling and se@@ aling to the building state templates .
the creation of bin@@ ary templates is simple : to copy the file only into one position folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as pul@@ ling and insert , or inser@@ ting over the file tree of con@@ quer@@ or .
in the file tree , or in the project files , you can click on a folder on the right and provide site template , backed up a name for the template and secure . by default , the project folder is guaranteed , but of course it can be used as a local or global template .
project templates will enable you to outline head@@ lines and foot@@ steps , or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or with them . additionally , you can keep some things in mind in projects very profound in projects .
the pre @-@ storage structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files embedded in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / p / quant@@ a / share / p / quant@@ a / load @-@ fed files . each of this folder is equivalent to one of four types of container , as explained above .
in order to set the behavior of a folder , right click on the folder and select in the context menu of the folder and in the context menu of the Account . the following Dialog appears :
a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is low as soon as El@@ ter@@ ous attributes have been hal@@ ted .
this is by default , and fits all except the stem cells in the deposits . if a regular folder would basically de@@ activate , unless they would be explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folders , the bla@@ h would appear with something such as text @-@ stone . if nothing appears , one is probably in a trunk folder .
allows previous or published text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project , enabling cop@@ ying of ingredients in a folder of special head@@ lines / foot@@ prints a full presentation already to match the matching head@@ lines .
in addition , you have the context menu ( pointing out , right mouse button ) about a complete command collection for adding folders or copy , and insert templates from one place to another .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Quell@@ text editor , replaced by the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the Second shares the editors in two parts : the source Editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor .
the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor works like this : he loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and switch in the source code editor , where the changes done in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor on a document , the &amp; PHP ; contains a small green symbol the V@@ oh@@ and@@ ance of &amp; PHP ; -@@ source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor . to edit , is still necessary to change the source editor . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode is just like the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source Editor and in V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor sync . with pres@@ sures of F@@ 9 , this mode is already active , the key pressure puts the active cur@@ sor from a window to another , while the position is maintained in the document .
the synchron@@ isation gap between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source code is adjustable using settings Qu@@ anta . in the selection automatically you can choose between synchron@@ ization by one click or automatically . basically , the recommendation is recommended : a small margin for fast computer and a large margin for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the web page , such is tools to choose document properties . this is the work of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor becomes possible , once a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; the editor will also be created . this is because of the reduction of the pend@@ ul@@ er Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ens . this allows you to change the following :
met@@ a @-@ tags allow the storage of information about the document themselves e.g. key@@ words for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click on the list allows modification of the content , such as key words on the column names and key@@ word key wor@@ t@@ 2 on the content column .
CSS @-@ rules are the new way of drawing up pages in the browser . you can delete or delete CSS @-@ rules using the buttons below the list . the editing of CSS @-@ rules is currently not currently supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style template by pressing to the file button and select the appropriate file .
the use of the C@@ urs@@ ors is like in a text processing , possible by carriage with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the C@@ ursor beha@@ ves as usual . the mark@@ ings works as usual . text can be inserted through obj@@ ection , and deleted by means of pus@@ h@@ button or removal .
inser@@ ting tags is made in the same way via the tool@@ bar , as in the source code . it &apos;s considered to be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags , for example , if an an@@ chor tag , is inserted with text , every other surrounding an@@ chor must be removed .
some workshops as the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled . you will later in &amp; V@@ PL ; work in this release , the tables or lists of materials are used .

there are many graphical tools for compar@@ isons . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me tell me briefly why I have written .
the con@@ duction was very complicated because one of the contributions made many changes , while at the same time corrected the re @-@ ref@@ unding . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was a lot of conflicts to collapse .
the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no evidence of the places where maybe only the re@@ moves had changed . that &apos;s why this change was a little night@@ mare .
so this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a row and changes to white signs . later , any number of other useful features have been added .
for example , if you want to compare your text quickly , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it in one of the compar@@ ative window .
a function which made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and perform of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a complete file browser .
also 3 @-@ way @-@ assembled is fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently of each other at a piece of co@@ de and make changes . the final text ( the base ) helps solve the correct evaluation . in this editor you can even edit the result . in this Editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screens@@ hot displays three Qu@@ ell files when they are introduced :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with the compar@@ isons and perform complete folder . this screens@@ hot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; at the folder @-@ assembled :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and re@@ jects the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often have to check co@@ de , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ s are displayed visible . if lines are only different in a certain number of white signs , one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble when someone is someone who happens . )
when a file is equal , and the other is different at a row , the colour displays which file is different . red colour means both files are different .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can easily make yourself the ti@@ p@@ ent work by using only the fil@@ ename of the first file . example :
Coll@@ ator 1 folder 2 , folder 2 , folder 2 , folder 2 , folder 2 , folder 2 , folder 2 , folder 2 , folder 2 , folder 2 , folder 2 , folder
the Open dialog allows the manual typ@@ ing of fil@@ ename , selecting the file &apos;s browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the set list . you do not specify the third file ; if you have to empty the entry for C , the analysis of the differences is performed with two files .
about the kno@@ b folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the comparison will be selected , for B and C , however a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ ename from A in the two other folders .
if compiled , the input field is active for destination and can edit . however , it is not necessarily required to immediately specify a output file . you can also get this step later on the stor@@ ing .
the set @-@ up button will open a dialogue with settings . here you can set the options before you start using the same / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board window . the comparison begins then immediately . in opening @-@ dialogue you have to select no files , you can close the dialog easily with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also drag and insert points : simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall over a compar@@ ative window .
which thought is behind it ? sometimes , a file contains like many similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively big effort . you would have to compare only two appropriate files , they are in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; download and then compare it . now , you can simply copy the relevant sections , and then compare .
note : right now you cannot draw anything out &amp; non@@ diff@@ usion : just draw the case of text into a compar@@ ative window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the pul@@ ling and insert text into another program than cutting and inser@@ ting ( instead of cop@@ ying and past@@ ing ) . in such cases , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text window , the info line contains the characters A , B or C , the file names and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that windows C is optional ) . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse a while on the line . then a small guide window will display the full name . )
the three clu@@ sters are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed over the Settings menu . )
when a difference is recognized , one sees at the colour which file is different . if both files differ , the default colour is different for it . ( colour for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merge ) well .
left beside the text is the summary column . if differences were found , the column shows the appropriate colour . in some programming languages , where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( with C / C + + , for example , white signs are relevant only in character chains and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare single cases . )
the vertical line that separates the summary column of the text is interrupted by places where the respective source file has no lines . when the row clo@@ ck@@ out is activated , the line is dot@@ ted in its ro@@ uted line .
the result window ( under the syn@@ onymous star ) also has an info line with the wording edition : , the fil@@ en@@ ames and &#91; changed &#93; when you edited the result . usually , it includes the automatic merge already text , but often it includes conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts arise , the stor@@ ks dis@@ ables ! ! ! ( use the buttons for the next stem / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ ative patterns are used , each difference is also to be solved at the same time a conflict of manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows that marks the line of belonging group in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . ( this will also be a jump of position within the windows that the beginning of the group would not be visible . ) This group is highlighted when the color color is highlighted above , and each on the left appears a black beam .
sometimes the automatic assem@@ bling or by manual work no further line exists in the group ; then there will be a space for the event that you change your opinion , and perhaps choose another source . this text appears either in the final file , nor in a mark@@ er that you might want to copy and elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; merge concepts ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this feature .
note : if selecting the sources the options apply or ignor@@ ant C / C + + comments are activated , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs .
navigate mainly with the image and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard on the left , right , high , r@@ unter , page from , beginning , end , stra@@ g @-@ start and shr@@ ubs , si@@ w like you can also use it from other programs . the Over@@ si@@ les column next to the vertical image bar can also be used to navig@@ ate .
in the Aug@@ .@@ ef@@ en@@ ster you can also use the other buttons for operation . with the paste button , you can switch between the insert and over@@ clo@@ cking mode . ( default is the one @-@ option mode . )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ izing columns , synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the start of each group ( as already in the section ) and the ed@@ itable out@@ put@@ score was explained in the section ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ down up@@ ward ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ Image Ab@@ road ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , all non @-@ resolved conflicts continue to be regarded as a conflict . therefore , between deleted and uns@@ killed conflicts must be distinguished .
to copy the mark@@ ings into the cli@@ p@@ board , you have to copy the Cop@@ y button ( Str@@ g @-@ C or Str@@ g paste ) . if this option is , you &apos;ll automatically copy the cli@@ p@@ board automatically and copy the manual cop@@ ying . be careful with this option but you might be able to over@@ ride the content of the cli@@ p@@ board .
new@@ row are stored in accordance with the underlying OS . Unix @-@ variants use a row pre @-@ di@@ p character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use W@@ agen@@ aud@@ ckl@@ es \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 ret@@ ains the line @-@ end of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of the most recently used files will automatically be saved and restored in the next start . ( menu obj@@ ection - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... )
choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also displays scripts with vari@@ abl@@ er width to choose from , you should not use them . )
if you activate this option , differences in short @-@ term scrip@@ tures are shown . if the chosen script does not support this account , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in its pure form , but would be put forward . on these systems the kno@@ b@@ ate pres@@ ets automatically puts an odd color .
when this option is activated , the g@@ aps of the Tab@@ ulator button is inserted the appropriate number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator character is inserted .
when entering or return , the entry of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
when this option is enabled , each selection will automatically be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . copy the manual to the cli@@ p@@ board falls into the cli@@ p@@ board .
you can select the line type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system .
at the compar@@ ing of files tried &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step can be ignored by white signs . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white signs are not ignored . in this step , white signs will not be ignored . even when together , white signs will not be ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a chari@@ ot pre @-@ sign &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line character &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , but then you could modify files with different sizes on page @-@ side comparison , however , like a white sign is treated . during which , this option must be disabled . in the default , this option has to be de@@ activated .
in the default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) ignored . in the result , the differences are still indicated , but they are treated like white signs .
in the default , this option is de@@ activated . changes in comments are treated like changes in white signs .
intensi@@ vely searching for even smaller differences . the option is activated in preference . it is effectively at complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in the Autom@@ atisch mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflicts will continue .
does not solve automatic all conflicts in white signs by selecting the selected file as a source . ( default , manual selection . ) That diff@@ ers from time to time . please note that the automatic selection also concerns conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignor@@ ant C / C + + -@@ comments are activated .
these options are dealt with in the chapter of Scan@@ nen by folders and announ@@ cing a consolidation . look for details under the documentation concerning the directory comparison and execution .
when a file is stored and already an older version exists , the original version does the Su@@ ff@@ ix .or@@ ously attached . if already such a back@@ pack file exists with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .or@@ ig , it will be deleted without further backup .
fits the language of the user interface . you do not need to end the current ongoing program . you have to end &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; finish and rest@@ art so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set up globally over the control centre ) .
the following co@@ generation settings can be set for each entry separately . if you activate this option , it will be used for all entries .
over the selection field for co@@ ding is a short notice which is the local co@@ ding . ( this can not change here and has for you purely informal character . )
adjust the file co@@ ding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . as the co@@ ding is adjustable to each file individually , even files with different enco@@ ding can be compared and combined .
if you have finished a file , you can specify which code to save is to be used .
if you define pre @-@ processing command , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Un@@ ic@@ ode , but the processing command can only be with 8 @-@ bit AS@@ C@@ II . ) With this option one can specify the co@@ ding of the output processing command .
turn this off to lower high@@ lighting of changes in white signs in the text or over@@ views . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignor@@ ant C / C + + -@@ comments are activated . )
this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a Color@@ ful band@@ ed column , but sometimes you might just want to see the differences between two of three files . -@@ gt ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed in addition to the normal still a second over@@ si@@ red column with the required information .
sometimes you want to use the space available on the screen rather for long lines . simply use the less important window . ( this option is in the window @-@ menu . )
specify the one side next to each other or to each other . this can also be useful to display long lines . ( this option is in the window @-@ menu . )
sometimes you see the differences and then you decide to bring the files together . up @-@ to @-@ date file will work together when you only compare two files . a simple click starts the con@@ duction and use the fil@@ ename of the last source file as default for the output file . ( if this function is used to merge again , then the name of the most recently used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is first transferred to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor , which corresponds exactly your requirements . you can use this function for example , cut b@@ obs@@ essive sections or to correct the rec@@ ti@@ fication .
when reading a file , it is stated first to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only when the row command processor command . you can write your own pre@@ processor , which corresponds exactly your requirements . each entry line must have an associated issue line .
the thought behind it is to allow the user more flexibility when placing di@@ ff results . however , an external program requires , and most users who do not want to program themselves . however , the good news is , however , that in most cases are sed sed or per@@ l .
use this pre @-@ processing command for new@@ row to transform the input into big letters : sed &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; The \ \ 1 in the creation string refers to the found text in the first Kl@@ am@@ mer@@ a few . the \ \ U turn the found text in large letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some key words to insert a string text ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ key word \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ . \ \ before the $ is needed because $ a special sign is and the end of the line would mean .
while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand and perhaps you may even think these regular expres@@ sions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ign@@ oring of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it &apos;s good as an example for a further processing command for new@@ en@@ ab@@ usi@@ .@@ sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 89.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted .
sometimes you may want to perform several re@@ aliz@@ ations at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use to separate the re@@ aliz@@ ations of each other . example :
instead of sed sed you can also use something different as such as per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / switches &apos; aller@@ dings are in per@@ l some details different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs per@@ l only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after normal pre@@ processor will be retained for viewing and coming together . further operations are only the data that sees the line @-@ number al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m .
please note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line number sees the version of normal pre@@ processor .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences hidden , you cannot notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often , programmers must edit many files in a folder . for this reason you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder re@@ ital@@ ic compared and merge together .
... makes every object a proposal to bring together ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can sim@@ ulate that and shows the simul@@ ated changes without making them really perform ,
... takes selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is similar to the compar@@ isons and execute single files very similarly . you only have to specify a folder on the Command Line or in the dialog file .
if three folder will be assembled , folder 1 is used as a base . if no target specified was specified , used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target @-@ folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not merge the merge , you need to select the appropriate menu item or press the F@@ 7 button . ( more details follow . )
while reading the folder you will inform you of a small news window about the current progress . if you break the scanning of the folder , only the files are listed until then .
if the scanning of the folder is complete , displays &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side ...
any file and each folder of the scan was found here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure will usually be folded together . you can click on the + / - click on the object , or using the arrow buttons for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions all sub@@ directories , and all sub@@ directories that you can stream all the folder .
if you click on a file , the file @-@ comparison will start and it appears a compar@@ ative window .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the connections will not be automatically selected . if that &apos;s running , you will be informed about problems of this type .
as seen in the above image , are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black .
however , with identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of the items is different .
folders are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical . then , folder is the same color . with folders , age is ir@@ relevant for its colour .
the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf@@ let , which is only green , then yellow will and later , when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , this can not be launched .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , this can not be launched .
the mode to syn@@ chr@@ oni@@ ze is active if only two folder and no explicit target specified were specified , and if the option directories are synchron@@ ised , and then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action to ensure that both folder are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as the visible fil@@ ename for the output file only B ; right after the merge copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are assembled and the option re@@ diff@@ ers instead of moder@@ ation ( un@@ certain ) enabled , then a error message : files are different , but the exact date is identical , but the exact date is identical .. sol@@ ange such errors are not eliminated , that &apos;s the merge the folder can not be started .
during the collapse , a file will be processed after the other . she &apos;s status column shows Fer@@ tig when the collapse was successful , and according to other messages , when something un@@ expect@@ edly emerged , you ought to re@@ produce a last review and see if the status is fine throughout .
if in the intersection the file method is selected , K@@ diff@@ 3 other columns will display . these contain the number of un@@ solved , sol@@ itary , non @-@ whit@@ ish and whit@@ ish conflicts . ( the column for deleted conflicts is only displayed when three folder is compared or together . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries in one time . if you have selected all the connections to each other ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can merge this .
please note : if you do not specified a target folder , then in the three @-@ folder mode C , it will be used as the target , in the two @-@ folder game , B is chosen as a destination and will be syn@@ chr@@ oni@@ ze A and / or B as a destination .
if you have selected a target audience , please check if all entries should be displayed in the target room , also in folder structure . check out these options to avoid uns@@ ett@@ ish surprises :
to bring all entries together : select fil@@ ing in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ b ) . to bring only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if through conf@@ lic@@ ting data types still incomplete actions exist , a message appears to be displayed on the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action then .
if you merge all entries , a dialogue window appears with the options lead , sim@@ ulate and ab@@ orting .
pick the sim@@ ulate if you would like to see what is going to happen without the real changes . you will then get an extensive list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute specific actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a cr@@ acking window will open ( note the screens@@ hot ) .
if you are finished with a file , select again or press folders or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; to make a mistake that appears a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you see some troub@@ les@@ ho@@ oting . if you decide to try it again , or to ski@@ p the problematic item . so you have the option to select another action to the entry or to solve the problem in other ways before going on with the collapse .
if some entries were individually assembled , you notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these items ( in current session ) and performs them at the later date of all entries or not saved , these entries are considered settled . only if you change the assembled action , these entries are again guided again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 to direct ... ) now has a section called register @-@ merger with these options :
only files that suit the stated pattern will be displayed in the elementary tree . you can separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid preference : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not correspond to this pattern .
files and folders correspond to this pattern , are not displayed in the elementary tree ; use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .or@@ ig ; * .@@ o .
files and folders correspond to this pattern , are not displayed in the elementary tree ; use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .or@@ ig ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would be ignored by CV@@ S . many autonom@@ ous files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder is specific to a .c@@ v@@ signal file . ( look under info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ esystem files , files contain a compar@@ ative attribute . in other fil@@ esystem you are marked a prec@@ eding point . this option makes you decide if these files are to be displayed in the elementary tree , or not . this option is enabled in the default .
when links to files : if the option is swit@@ ched , symbolic short@@ cuts is compared . if the option is swit@@ ched , the files are compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in preference .
when links to folder : if the option is swit@@ ched , the links how regular folder will be treated and recur@@ sively searches . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not to possible record high@@ s ) , links to a folder of a link on yourself would lead to a final loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; cr@@ ashes away . ) This option is placed in the default notation .
introduces a complete analysis of each file by and shows the statistics columns . ( the number of dis@@ solved , un@@ solved , non@@ - and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is s@@ lower than a simple bin@@ ary analysis , and much s@@ lower when it is applied to files which do not contain text . ( enter a written anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare big folder via a slow network , it is likely to compare the change date and the file size . however , this speed advantage does not cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is un@@ folded in preference .
similar to trust the change date . there is no real comparison place . the files are considered identical if they are identical . this can be useful for example when cop@@ ying the amend@@ ment has been lost . please use caution . this option is un@@ folded in preference .
enabled the synchron@@ ise mode when two folder is compared and no target specified was specified . in this mode , the proposals are assembled , so that both the folder are identical . also , the results of the merge files are stored in both folders . this option is placed in default .
if there are differences will be held instead of the cop@@ ying of the newer file as an action . ( this will be considered un@@ certain , because it is assumed that the other file does not change too . ) This option is placed in default .
if a file or a folder is replaced by another or deleted , the original version is ren@@ amed and gets deleted . if an old backup file with the .or@@ c extension has already existed , this will also affect normal connections , not just the combined folder . this option is swit@@ ched on the default .
normally , the ste@@ er @-@ merge view ten@@ ds to move along individual files ; you can switch to the Fen@@ gh@@ ert@@ lers with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want this , you can switch the folder &amp; text window to switch the main window in the window menu and switch through change between directory &amp; text window between the two views switch .
probably you prefer to compare a file using a double @-@ click menu . nevertheless , there is also a corresponding menu entry . you can install a single file also directly , without the folder , the status will be reset and the file will not re@@ vert when you start the folder .
however , this status is lost though , if you read the directory again : list -@@ menu : new read
KDE supported network transparent with the help of KI@@ O slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . this allows you to specify files and folders for opening up on local or remote machines .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a ftp @-@ server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a comp@@ ressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syn@@ tax to be a local files and a folder . some things should be observed :
a path may be relative rounded or .. included . this is not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ c . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # foo # the URL file : / % 23@@ foo % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . there is a brief list of constraints :
or it cannot be distinguished if a link to a file or a folder . then a file is accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , ftp : ) .
there is no way to process author@@ ations or change of change . therefore , the author@@ ations or modification date from the original date . ( consider the option to trust the size . ) ( this is possible only with local files . )
the main purpose of reference is currently the differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts with the built @-@ in differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts with the right mouse button on the differences and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
usually required &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as K@@ Part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files in the Uni@@ fied format . then ent@@ ail &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program Patch laun@@ ches the missing file to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part . besides , this does not work if any of its original files does not exist . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have been changing since the patch of the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ ing of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . this combined or the comparison of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now it is comp@@ ressed ) there are already . furthermore , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it may bring together as the program diff@@ use 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I &apos;ve learned a lot of GPL @-@ programs for a long time and have learned a lot by reading into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this path or have to go .
you &apos;ve probably not compiled the program from the sources and configure the configure command to KDE . in the default configure in / usr / local , but then KDE can not find resources for the user interface ( e. g . k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the README file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white signs differ slightly , these lines will be treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is considered not identical . if similar lines are next to each other , this is the same but this item is the case .
the editor will remember every difference in the files where it begins and where it ends . this is needed to solve a conflict simply by clicking on the source code and selecting the button A / B / C , however , it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could store this information .
the effort for this has so far been too large . you can restore a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to process larger quantities of text should be used by another editor .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No src is defeated ; published and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors for prot@@ ru@@ ding of differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and lacking the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and troub@@ les@@ ho@@ oting came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thanks !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you may need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ deck@@ 3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage .
you will find a list of recent changes under ht@@ tp : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / ch@@ angel@@ og or in the Ch@@ angel@@ og file .

show differences : files the same as all folders are not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target @-@ folder .
( in the current version you must update about changes to these options the folder with the function Upd@@ ating new insights . )
there are only entries to display the differences . this also performs that identical files will not be copied in the target folder . if the target @-@ folder , these files will not already exist , they are missing after that . ( the behavior will probably be amended in a later program version . ) This option is swit@@ ched in the default version .
note the buttons for selecting the source using the sign@@ ment A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are attached to one of the buttons , the lines are attached to the close window at the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) , they are removed by clicking on the button below .
in preference , this option is de@@ activated . underground differences in individual signs ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white signs .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini@@ ature of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite handy to see the ongoing programs on the desktop to change its size , stop or shift it . this works both within a desktop and for several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; it can display all virtual work@@ spaces plus the applications running in it . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop .
with the middle mouse button you can create windows within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other desktop areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked on : when on the empty background of &amp; k@@ ager , then the context menu has inserted only the two entries ... and end . if however on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , it also appears on the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ izing , maxim@@ ize , on desktop and end . the commands effect the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the desktop . appears only when applied to an application .
send the application to select virtual desktop . appears only when applied to an application .
if this cross field is marked , windows can be moved inside the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also shi@@ fted to other work@@ spaces .
if this field is crossed , are in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual desktop are shown .
An@@ kreu@@ zen this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; displaying the numbers of virtual work@@ spaces . is it together with name show , the names are provided with or@@ din@@ al@@ - , eg ; 1 . working space .
if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also shown as background in the background .
if this field is crossed , the current programs are displayed as a small window in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , others will only be shown the empty desktop to make their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the propor@@ tions of the program window . symbol shows the windows with its basic symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . remark : Pix@@ map is recommended only for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be determined : classi@@ cally leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n re@@ aster appear , like out of P@@ ager applications in some other wind@@ ow@@ els ; wa@@ agre@@ cht shows all virtual work@@ spaces in a horizontal series , which is very good for the representation on the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; it can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini@@ ature program in the check@@ box . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , view the windows as symbols or with their content . besides , it runs outside the check@@ box .
click on the right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent acquisition of swit@@ chers ... lets the dialog settings appear .
at the moment , this cannot change in dialogue settings , but you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or VI@@ . if you do not have a writing desk for the file , you have to register as a user root or sign up to your system administrator . in this file you have to as@@ sign the key to wind@@ ow@@ Transpar@@ ent mode and as@@ sign it to this one value . possible values are :

if you prefer , start a window as pic@@ tured above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the enlarged section of the screen . in the following , this window appears as a magni@@ fier . in the following , this window appears as an enlargement window , is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as the selection window below .
in the default setting , it may be enlarged ; the area around the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor like a movable magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can arrange a selected screen for the magni@@ fier mode ) or the environment of the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor on the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) .
wish to avoid that the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor in the enlarged window is displayed , select the default mouse @-@ cur@@ sor . please note that &amp; b ; currently still not able to detect the form of the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor . this is always the standard @-@ k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse @-@ cur@@ sor .
in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouth @-@ keys and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor in the magni@@ fier window and keep the left mouse buttons , so you can catch the content of the magnific@@ ation window and move . this goes also with the arrow buttons .
if you additionally have the &amp; Shift ; taste button or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can post@@ p@@ it the selection window .
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the window stops are standing and only the lower right corner is to move .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse @-@ click as soon as the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor turns a while on the same place . it is meant to help people suffering from rep@@ ut@@ itive imp@@ air@@ ment ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and those each mouse @-@ click pain . besides , it can em@@ ulate the pul@@ ling with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; may cause the pain by clicking the mouse and thus helps to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also suffer from the mere loading of the mouse . suffer from pain that are associated with using your computer , you should look up a doctor if this has not yet been done .
to make it happen once again : even though &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain also helps with clicking with the mouse , it &apos;s against pain , which are caused by the loading of the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonom@@ ic aids , the result can vary for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse mot@@ ions and introduces a mouse click as soon as you break the motion short .
is the smart re@@ loc@@ ating system makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it takes the pressing the mouse button . move the mouse run by mouse button . in this way you can execute the pul@@ ling with pressing mouse button . this smart moving requires a little practice , but you get used to get rid of it quickly .
this denial must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; one mouse click out .
is smar@@ ter Ver@@ sho@@ wer@@ ed , becomes the spin @-@ shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) active . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is waiting , before taking the mouse @-@ right mouse button before it shu@@ ts the mouse button again , if the mouse @-@ time doesn &apos;t use any proof of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the Click with mouse deport@@ ation , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow @-@ due to the left and back brings a double @-@ click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ t@@ xt file , if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
if the sound appears hes@@ it@@ ated , you can move &amp; k@@ de ; to do so , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose Sound System and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der Sound puzzle , which you can adjust to a lower value to shor@@ ten the speed levels .
this option is marked , is &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; start with each start by &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to determine how to automatically start a program there .

the best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first of all with the pres@@ ets . especially the smart re@@ loc@@ ating should you be swit@@ ched at first . if you then hit the automatic mouse click , you can later push the smart re@@ loc@@ ating .
when you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times from &amp; k@@ de ; to decrease in sounds .
first , you should be aware of what places a mouse @-@ click without effect remains : the click on the neutral components of windows or on positions in the browser window which does not represent a link , does not cause un@@ certain reactions . you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use them again .
when your mouse ru@@ ck@@ elt , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you will not only clean the mouse but also the roles that come with the mouse ball in touch .
first , you have to remove the mouse h@@ emisph@@ ere . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . but it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are located on the sides of the hole , used to the ball . the dirt and dirt can easily be used with a flat blade or the F@@ ing@@ ern@@ ag@@ el ab@@ kr@@ atzen .
in very rare situations the operating system breaks the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if just a reference finish started . if you are in this case the smart re@@ loc@@ ating means , that &apos;s that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool means that the surgery cannot finish more by clicking the mouse .
this happens when you are using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using another window manager and post@@ p@@ one a window .
the solution for this problem is that you perform yourself a mouse click . in this case , the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is reset and you can continue as usual .
problem : if you type in text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to run mouse clicks and put the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor to place where you want to have it . however , you can no longer manage the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you do not encounter the mouse on a neutral button . safe zones for the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the gray area around the tool@@ bar and menus and the titles of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent connection , but I don &apos;t manage to edit the text .
the smart moving is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very well possible to copy text in the cli@@ p@@ board , or want to insert it in the cli@@ p@@ board , while selecting the mouse with pressing mouse button . but there will probably be some advice to them :
do not use the smart re@@ loc@@ ating process if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; select text instead , and keep the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor to the other end of the text and move again the mouse button .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . thus , every@@ time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse is pressing a sound like a mouse click . later , you can use the smart moving also without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but in addition , it requires some practice .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; you have to be the X@@ Test @-@ extension for &amp; X Win@@ dow ; installed in most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system features a sound card and speakers and it is correctly furnished .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; att@@ ain@@ ted the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor as soon as the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor . this program was developed for people who suffer the R@@ SI syndrome and which the actu@@ ality of the m@@ est pain is causing .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be con@@ figured that there is a certain time waiting for a pul@@ ling process begins before the mouse is left off . in this way the pul@@ ling and se@@ aling can be done with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with the mu@@ te user can let their computers speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; you can let mu@@ te users let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list of the conversation reports that should be talked again .
on the first page of the assistant ( left @-@ screen screens@@ hot ) give the command a , later used for the language version of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dial@@ ogs .
on the second page you can choose the default text@@ book . from the text @-@ related books you can often choose text messages , without having to sell them . the text messages can be processed naturally .
on the third page ( right side photo ) you define the dictionary for words of words . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can dism@@ iss the list with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be absorbed into words .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains basically a input field for the ke@@ yp@@ ass@@ ure@@ ment of your propos@@ itions ( the lower white field in the screens@@ hot ) and a run @-@ memory of the already spoken propos@@ itions ( the upper white field in the screens@@ hot ) .
if you have a mouth ; right , you can input the propos@@ itions , you can hear in the input field , which you want to hear . each cont@@ est@@ ed proposition is attached to the memory @-@ memory . you can select from these propos@@ itions that should be talked again .
with the menu @-@ entry settings k@@ mouth ; direct ... open the setup dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two boxes of cards , language and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ itory , and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language .
in the input field of map language , enter the command to call the language generator . in the box field under the input field , insert the character enco@@ ding , which will be shared with the text on the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the cross field if the text is to be shared as default on the language generator .
if the cross field is not selected , the text will be shared as a parameter . you can use the following ment@@ er :
of course , the command to the language delivery depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation about your language generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
with the prefer@@ able as language assistance we use &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language assistance . the kt@@ ts@@ d language assistance is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Dem@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ App@@ lic@@ on is further developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is sensible , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the menu text editor or in the gro@@ in for text messages .
with the selection of So@@ fort , the chosen text passage is spoken directly and included in the memory area . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text passage is first entered only in the input field .
with the second selection field , closing the editing window for the text file , you can set whether the text@@ book must be automatically saved at the closing of the editing window automatically .
if you select the text file , the book is stored . if you choose any changes , the text@@ book will not be saved . select Next to ask , is &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text@@ book is to be saved .
the page Wor@@ ter@@ gÃ¤n@@ ation contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for words . in the main window next to the input field displays &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field when this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection field , you can choose the dictionary to register for words .
with the buttons on the right side you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of books , or export them to a file . below the list can be used in input field and set the language for the dictionary .
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation the frequency of individual words is determined simply by count the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word@@ list with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary to include only correct words into the new dictionary .
this option allows you to merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; asks , which dic@@ tion@@ aries are led and how they are to be weigh@@ ted .
with this option you set a new , empty dictionary without entries to . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; new introduced words automatically insert in the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary .
the main area of the window to edit the text @-@ related books is devi@@ ded . in the upper part the text @-@ related books are shown as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text@@ passage or the corresponding key@@ note . if you have selected a text@@ book , you can only change its name .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actions like new text @-@ passages or books add or delete selected text @-@ passages and books either by selecting in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a fold @-@ down menu . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the order of text @-@ related books or text @-@ passages can be changed by using the mouse to the new position or with the arrow buttons and the &amp; Alt ; button .
the chosen text is cut out and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a tex@@ tual section is chosen , it will be used , otherwise the selected parts of the contrac@@ tor .
the chosen text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field , a tex@@ tual section is selected , this will otherwise use the selected parts of the contrac@@ tor .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if the text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected propos@@ itions of the discharge .
if this menu entry is inst@@ ated , a shifting tool@@ bar is displayed for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar can be arranged directly under the tool@@ bar . by mouse @-@ clicking on the sh@@ red@@ ded left side and pul@@ ling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow cor@@ ste in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed , if not crossed , this status bar has been hidden .
if this menu entry is inst@@ ated , a shifting ly@@ ste for text @-@ related books is displayed directly under the tool@@ bar . by mouse @-@ clicking on the sh@@ red@@ ded left side and pul@@ ling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
probably you do not have the command for the language version properly or not completely . open settings k@@ mouth ; direct ... , open the page General Settings and enter the command for voice / voice programming language . ( see setup dialog for voice synth@@ esizer for further details . )
Festival is a language broadcast system of the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ ch are supported . the license allows to use the festival for free and without further restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice , it is assumed that the festival in the / usr / local / festival is installed . the command to release the language is then :
Free@@ TTS is a in &amp; Java ; ground language generator . currently , it only supports the English language . the license allows you to use Free@@ TTS for free and without any restrictions .
to show an example of a command line for setting up the language issue , it is assumed that Free@@ TTS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ et . language issue is then possible with one of the three following commands :
for the third example the option should send data as default information . ( this is the recommended example of using Free@@ TTS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . he conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ on@@ emen in a W@@ av@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , therefore you need an additional program to dis@@ integrate the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA free of non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax likes to refuse the last sign of the text , so that an additional sign must be added . the full command is therefore more costly than in the other examples :
( Cat - ; echo ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ xt@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / de@@ 1 / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ spl@@ ay / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written into one line . the option is to send data as default .
the language broadcast Dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ more language assistance , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ uses a standard interface for language delivery . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being further developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various language systems .
as setting the voice @-@ generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you have to use only as possible as language assistance in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
to adjust the page K@@ TT@@ SD language assistance , which is in the entry dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successful to use , you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but depends on the individual from your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who can not speak , output text by the computer . it will be saved as a list of spoken phr@@ ases which the user can re @-@ cast again and again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language synth@@ esizer includes . on the machine a language synth@@ esizer may be installed .

most TTS @-@ synth@@ esizer provide various languages and voices , as well as various male or female , or such that is defined in volume or speed . you can also set up multiple variants for a synth@@ esizer . you should also re @-@ establish a speaker . you should at least use a speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use as the program speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker .
various speakers for the same synth@@ esizer can be compared with several print@@ outs for the same printer .
if you click on the cardboard box in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the card menu is displayed . this also appears automatically when you start t@@ sm@@ gr and yet no speaker is set up .
all already decorated speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear above in the list . the top@@ chief speaker is used for voice @-@ overs if an application does not give an spokes@@ man .
please select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
please select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speakers on the list one line further down . the order of the speaker in the list is also its priority .
click on one of these buttons for your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ on ; -@@ system to apply .
select here a voting type , there are three mascul@@ ine and three female voices as well as a young voice and girl &apos;s voice to choose from .
when you click here , the new speaker appears on the map card speaker . to change the settings of this speech , click Edit .

filter for drawing up is a good option in &amp; kt@@ on ; wrong , or incorrect to correct messages . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is included , is a good example . you remove the tags br and b from the news that can be sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , since it can be accepted in most cases as provided .
filter is one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; . for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filter is not required .
in fil@@ tering , text is edited , before he is sent to the program Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation to select wrong words or ab@@ brevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker or to get specific short@@ com@@ ings of language synthetic speakers and their voices .
to understand the functioning of fil@@ tering , it is important to know how the program &quot; Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; diff@@ ers four types of texts .
the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ ars has the highest priority . it will be drag@@ ged to all other orders and maintains this orders . if the output of screen reader is pre @-@ read , the stopped orders will be continued .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is going to be hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after issu@@ ing the warning .
News have the nearest top priority . a message leaves normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application to read the messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a website can be read , you can go with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone you just enter the room . &amp; k@@ de ; not@@ i@@ fications are also news . read on this .
the rest are simple text orders . each order that you encounter from the map card is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that are used text messages . text messages are intended for the issue some texts that have no particular ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in waiting @-@ long , with the exception of the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application is sent the output of a screen file , during &amp; kt@@ on ; just one such pre@@ read , this issue will be stopped and ended .
first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen re@@ funds . you will be applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text messages as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ news .
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in future , there can still be more kinds of filters .
pun@@ ctu@@ ation replace parts of a text by other text . the add parts can be used either as words or as regular expres@@ sions . it is provided with pre@@ defined character de@@ coder as : - ) by text or for the form@@ att@@ ing of messages from &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; c@@ mail ; in a better understanding .
&amp; XML ; -@@ re@@ former use a X@@ SLT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) um &amp; XML ; from a format into a different format . included in the scope of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SLT files to translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML included .
with inter@@ locking filters , you can send orders from the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text on &amp; kt@@ on ; if you have asked for example on the cardboard card speaker a female voice , you can read text from KDE news about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which he is applied to a language issue . if the filter is fixed , it does not apply the text out the next filter to the next filter .
if a text message , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification is sent , it is edited by all activated filter , which were arranged on the page below . the processing by the filter is placed in sequence in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the furnished normal filters . is a filter not being crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filter are processed the number after the top down .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of fil@@ ters and there will be shown below the following entries .
if you have a list of words or regular interpre@@ ters you need to enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions . these patterns will be changed in the text , then the text will be exchanged against the corresponding replacement text . great and low @-@ off will not be observed when compared .
type your filter a name . you can choose this name only , it must be different from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the string in column , and replaced him in agreement with the string in column . the list is processed from top to bottom .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file to save or delete current list . download a list from a file , the entries are attached from the file to the existing list .
if a language entered , the filter is only applied , if the speaker speaks for the text entry one of the languages listed here . click the button to select a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click on the mouse @-@ click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; key pressed .
here is a value registered , the filter is applied only if the text depends on one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID circul@@ atory programs received you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ numbers you need to we@@ gl@@ ist . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID Kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only enter Cop@@ ete .
the sign of drawing filter is applied only to the text when all conditions with an entry in the box di@@ esen filter apply if possible . are all input fields of blank , the filter is applied to all texts .
when compared to words the sign @-@ in @-@ application filter regul@@ ari@@ zed phr@@ ases in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. the words must therefore be limited by part@@ itions ( spaces ) .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expres@@ sions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; terms that you can put it in the dial@@ ogs , or work as help to merge these expres@@ sions . the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; terms &amp; # 160 ; terms find out in the package un@@ ambig@@ uous .
&amp; XML ; -@@ form@@ ers translate &amp; XML ; using the help of X@@ SLT files from a format into another format . x@@ s@@ lt ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such revers@@ als . but it can only be used on well @-@ shaped XML . the Hilf@@ sprogramm x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is available via the environment variable P@@ ATH is also enough x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
with the Spe@@ aker filter you can send texts to a specific speaker , who is on the map present@@ er , or to an speaker with certain properties . you can , for example , that texts by k@@ mail should be read from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ on ; a text sent to the filter , it looks a spokes@@ man for the text . the speaker is named according to the speaker features that sends the text on &amp; kt@@ on ; and the properties of those on the Kart@@ ei@@ Card present@@ er . with the Spe@@ aker filter you can over@@ write the selected speakers .
here is a value entered , the filter is applied , in case the text contains the given regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; terms &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions , you can call this by a click on the button to get help in input .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to an@@ chor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
here , you define the characteristics of the desired microphone . if the text shown the above fil@@ tering conditions , the speaker will be selected , which corresponds to the desired requirements . click the button to view the dialog option .
use these buttons to store or load your speaker settings , or delete all settings .
the reading @-@ filter filter is applied only to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box di@@ esen filter if applicable . you need to enter at least one condition .
the language issue API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmers can give their applications TTS @-@ skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ module API , with the language synth@@ esizer can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , allowing you to use this synth@@ esizer .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the language delivery API of &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both A@@ PI@@ s can be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility Website ( ht@@ tp : / / accessi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .

here is text of text to read and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc . ;
there are more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands you will be giving
open two &amp; console ; -@@ window . start first on the one window , then t@@ sm@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned language synth@@ esizer supports my language . where can I get a synth@@ esizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Um@@ former@@ filter , but when using the module for festival websites , web pages will not be read .
caused by an error in the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone to install it . you will also do this if you don &apos;t want to use this voice to read Web sites . also ensure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found on the environment variable P@@ ATH .
certain signs or intervals of characters appear to cause errors in synth@@ esizer , so that whole phr@@ ases are lo@@ wer@@ ed or just ch@@ est@@ wel@@ d is spent on it ? what can I do against it ?
first of all , ensure that the option of character enco@@ ding is adjusted to the right value for the appropriate language . are there problems with certain signs or words , these may be re@@ medi@@ ed by a sign of data de@@ coder . see .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uses a custom@@ iz@@ able module @-@ architecture for voice synth@@ esizer . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ on ; for the use of another synth@@ esizer , contact the development team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; -@@ changing filter , but is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to compile &amp; kt@@ on ; you need a current development environment of KDE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including packages k@@ deli@@ ver@@ bs and the relief files for the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you refer to the source Tex@@ ts of &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source text@@ archive for k@@ de@@ fer , or downloaded the tar@@ ball , and install the program with the following commands :
before you use , check first if Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher works correctly with your language synth@@ esizer . you can use the shell @-@ script SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ on ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; that is used the program Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be further developed , that the setup of speech driver is directly possible and the script SPD @-@ conf no longer needed .
a long text is dis@@ assem@@ ble in individual sent@@ ences . the user can proceed or withdraw from stat@@ ute , repeat the output or ab@@ orting the output .
if an application text is placed on &amp; kt@@ on ; for example , it can provide an application for example a female English speakers . if you have set an speaker , whose language is English and its gender is female , that otherwise , otherwise the best suits will be chosen . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ on ; a speaker cho@@ oses , you will see in .
if you click on the map subject to adding , and thus click on the list or on request , the map card holder will be shown . as an example , the installation of the module for the Festival Inter@@ active is shown below . details on the modules can be found below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is located in P@@ ATH , you only have to enter into festival .
select the character co@@ ding for text , who is handed over at the festival . generally speaking , this setting is automatically made . generally speaking , Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 are using , com@@ mon@@ astic languages such as Czech or Slov@@ ak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you will make volume , microphone speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some controllers and display this grey , the voice you selected does not make these settings .
some voices such as multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require a number of seconds to be loaded on account of their size . if you mark this connection field , these voices are already loaded when starting from K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the first set will be synth@@ esi@@ zed by the first set .
if this connection is not selected , you have not yet set up a spokes@@ person ( or forget to apply it ) .
is this connection marked , is shown at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr the program window t@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , after starting only the symbol kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the system section visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this cross field is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not run yet , it appears in the system of the system , once K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this gives you the opportunity to read or control it otherwise .
here are all orders in the queue listed , together with the application that has adjusted the order , the current status of the contract , the number of propos@@ itions and the just edited sentence . the speaker id corresponds to the column ID upon the card speaker .
with the buttons in this series you can get sat@@ in the order that is selected in the list below , pre @-@ - or return . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with one click to OK all changes of settings ( also on the other map cards ) has been picked up and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this symbol to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stream@@ er or a@@ Ko@@ en , click on the card @-@ card audio . see also .
here only text messages are performed and managed . expenditure of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ars , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . more information on the messages types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , you have been compiled or dict@@ ated ; either without support for the corresponding Audi@@ om@@ o@@ module , the necessary libraries can not load .
if g@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de can be used for audio input , select here the audio output . if no output mode can be displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . have AL@@ SA selected , click here the PC@@ M device . see also
Set the rate speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % represents around half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % approximately the double normal microphone speed . so that these settings may be implemented , the program must so@@ x be installed .
click to apply the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ on ; -@@ system to take over .
the list of AL@@ SA devices comprises all PC@@ M devices and modules that are decorated in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll have to find out which machine works with you . in doubt you choose default .
on this map map you can set special actions that will always be executed when the text entry is interrupted by a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of voice orders :
the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ ars has the highest priority . it will be drag@@ ged to all other orders and maintains this orders . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the stopped orders will be made again .
war@@ nings have the next @-@ key priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is going to be hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application to read the news . if you want &amp; eg ; just a long text on a website can be read , you can join with &amp; k@@ mouth ; but you can have someone who just step@@ ped onto the room .
if a text message is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen player , the audio output is transferred in the queue .
this audio file is always recorded when a normal text entry is interrupted . if both intro@@ duc@@ tory sound and intro@@ duc@@ tory message is active , the intro@@ duc@@ tory sound is being played before the intro@@ duc@@ tory news .
the settings on this map are valid only for normal text messages . for messages , war@@ nings and expenses of screen readers , there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ not@@ fy @-@ News pre @-@ read , launch c@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click not@@ i@@ fications .
highlight this note field to switch the pre @-@ reading &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ not@@ i@@ fications , this option is not marked , the remaining settings are disabled and pun@@ ctu@@ ation ; reads no not@@ i@@ fications before .
if this stance is marked , not@@ i@@ fications in which a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ on ; not read .
use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button below , a dialog appears , where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message which &amp; conversation , sent when someone is mentioned in a IR@@ C message your nickname .
all events , for which in the list is nothing else indicated , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this selection field to specify exactly what &amp; kt@@ on ; do when an event occurs . you have the following options :
if you selected the defined text selected , enter the desired text . you can use the following Plac@@ eholder :
you can enter the properties of the desired microphone . standard cho@@ oses the speaker that is displayed in the list on map cards as top of the show . see this also .
note that there are three levels for events . if there is an action for a certain event , this will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of certain application . as the last option , the action is scheduled for carrying out under standard ( all other events ) .
the event All not@@ i@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . you can specify the messages as follows :
use the button save to load the settings for not@@ i@@ fications in a file . use the button to load stored settings from a file . when you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries are deleted . all entries are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for a language delivery . besides , this standard contains brands for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation , for example , ab@@ brevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently , SS@@ ML only supports partly and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are present :
you have to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( brit@@ ish male ) since this is the default , the festival used in the issue of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or space in the festival configur@@ ations dialog is not to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % is set , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on@@ on .
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#93; = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ TD Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / EN &quot; ht@@ tp : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / Spe@@ ech @-@ Syn@@ thesis / synth@@ es@@ is@@ .d@@ t@@ d &quot; &gt; Who has slept in my bed ? asked Mama B@@ Ã¤r . who has slept in my bed ? asked the be@@ ck@@ ind . &#93; &#93; &gt;
there are two types of filters - normal filters and stat@@ utes of fil@@ ment filter ( SD@@ B @-@ filter ) . SB@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into individual sent@@ ences . thus , you can also delete or ab@@ rupt the whole set . thus , you can also jump on the map map to jump or with@@ hold and ab@@ ort , even if language synth@@ esizer does not support this directly .
here you see the stat@@ utes of rules . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ on ; it will be automatically set up as an en@@ core of the rules of rules , you can change its settings or add more to the typ@@ ist filter , but will get rid of it .
the easiest way to check the installation of Spre@@ cher@@ y . place the Spre@@ cher@@ choice orders , which speaker &amp; dict@@ ates ; select some features and check how the selection of the microphone changes . you , of course , you need to have more than a spokes@@ person , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ on ; then you can begin with the pre @-@ read , as only the first sentence needs to be processed and not the entire text block , which can last very long ,
you can then switch orders on the map map or ab@@ ort , even if language synth@@ esizer this function did not support .
for these reasons , the normal typ@@ ology group is automatically set up , if you start t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it can not be swit@@ ched , just removed . change nothing at this filter , unless you know what you are doing .
propos@@ itions lenses compare text with a regular expression for stat@@ utes and insert a tabl@@ ed sign ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) to the stat@@ utes ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) in front of the fil@@ tering automatically from the text ( default ) .
S@@ BD @-@ Filter will never be applied on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ news ( k@@ re@@ ed ) , war@@ nings , messages or issue of screen re@@ funds .
if you have removed form of reference to the normal propos@@ itions filter , you can insert this again by loading the file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts ; included file standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the map of speech &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spre@@ cher@@ choice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can transfer the Spre@@ cher@@ settings for the application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; card is shown if &quot; &quot; &quot;
use of the standard @-@ speaker ( the top on the cart@@ on card ) . in other words , there is no spokes@@ man features .
use of the most appropriate microphone , which displays all the properties of an equipped microphone . if you choose to delete or edit the settings of the intercom function , select &amp; kt@@ on ; this speaker has been selected . otherwise , the speaker has chosen , who originally proposed the properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; select the method for entering the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the optional features . &quot; &quot; &quot;
select here the qualities of the desired microphone . if this feature doesn &apos;t matter , you don &apos;t give anything .
flag this note field when the feature should prevail over other properties . you can also put several mark@@ ings here .
since the language is a critical factor when performing the output is , it is always used as a priority feature . you will rarely use this property . the only case in which you possibly want to specify the attribute . if you know that a particular application text sent text in a different language than the one in the working environment .
to use all properties in the area of speakers , who are at the bottom to clear the following , click the op@@ tionally kno@@ b default , and then use on speakers that corresponds to the test below .
in this case 0 is valid for the last text entry in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( with no order number is the input 0 required ) .
kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr stor@@ ks immediately when it started . I have compiled debug support , but I do not receive any back@@ tracking .
G@@ Stream@@ er is cr@@ ashed and acted ; probably you need to register G@@ Stream@@ er 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved by the G@@ Stream@@ er 0.@@ 8.@@ x if the problem is not solved , it is a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stream@@ er . you can attempt to update G@@ Stream@@ er or un@@ install .
the audio @-@ broadcast about AL@@ SA does not work when I depos@@ ited music at the same time using another application , free@@ zes and kt@@ on ; a note on the &amp; con@@ sole ; appears a message that says : ts to open PC@@ M .
on your system , there is the problem that conflicts with AL@@ SA can occur that can prevent a simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . notes for possible solutions can be found on the website of AL@@ SA @-@ Projects ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I have loaded an additional voice for the festival on the internet . I installed it and can use them in the festival , but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice .
if you add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / festiv@@ al@@ int / add the new voice . if that is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you found the voice to the developer .
on the map of audio there is a setting speed . that this works , the program must so@@ x installed and features the environment variable p@@ ATH . some synth@@ esizer hand@@ ul@@ s like Festival Inter@@ active provide a adjustment for speed . depending on the chosen voice this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speech speed will be ignored if &amp; kt@@ on ; &amp; HTML ; ( this is because the HTML is controlled by SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; according to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite cour@@ ageous , you change the .x@@ sl file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ nach @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ Um@@ former@@ filter , and set the speed limit .
I don &apos;t manage to be read on websites with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker . I read the websites with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the tag seems to do not work . hence , the X@@ SL file re@@ jects the X@@ SL file for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber , the gender @-@ tags . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE @-@ tags .
I have added another sign of drawing filter and now I can enter &amp; kt@@ on ; no longer sat@@ in - or return . on the Kart@@ ei@@ ght@@ rated orders is displayed , the order is not just one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?

Festival is one of the best free TTS @-@ synth@@ esizer , whose source code is obvious . the quality of votes is good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices you can adjust speakers , microphone speed and pitch .
you need to install at least one language . help to get in the instructions that are supplied with festival . if you want to read web pages you need to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you must compile an additional module , therefore you need the source code from the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer .
this voice puts the Festival 1,@@ 95 beta or new ahead . the voice is still in an early phase . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / tel / Russian / . if you enter the Russian voices , you have to enter for the voices ms@@ u _ ru _ ns@@ h _ di@@ phone . select a Cyr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ Bit@@ - ) co@@ ding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions are therefore first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , option enco@@ ding is to be adjusted to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the option of enco@@ ding is to be set to a 8 @-@ bit Cyr@@ illi@@ c as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ synth@@ esizer . then takes over the lex@@ ic@@ al@@ an analysis and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; thus creates the audio output . the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ program and the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; no complete language slide @-@ system is generated . &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; generates language from Di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to generate this di@@ phone .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ iller center ; that allows the management of network interfaces , rout@@ ing and the DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ monitor center ; allows the user to manage a series of system@@ - and desktop settings above a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ iller center ; can be accessed by selecting K Menu k@@ iller center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , such as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ file ; create the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings at the &amp; k@@ monitor center ; displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting action ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware is not able to install . physical devices and their drivers have already been functioning properly and con@@ figured with it &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and the adjustment of the network features enables .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed in installing &amp; Linux ; with installed and installed . network devices will be added later , the drivers have to be loaded by adjust@@ ing the following files , according to the core version , are loaded :
the module network settings is loaded , when the option network settings at the &amp; k@@ monitor center ; -@@ Index selected will be selected . when running the module &apos;s module , the platform used on the system automatically detect .

the changing network settings is possible only in the system management mode . before , all options are gray , which means , the adjustments can only be considered , change@@ ment is not possible . in the system management system at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system of the system , the entire functionality of the module is available . this one is divided into three riders :
the rider network interface is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the tab network , the following tasks can be carried out :
the settings shown above can be set by selecting the desired device in the list and click of the button &quot; button to set up ... in the dialog unit .

the list nam@@ acci@@ dentally known computers describes in@@ pag@@ e@@ user interface for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily at boot when no DNS server can be available . in small , inter@@ connected networks can replace it DNS server .
normally the list of well @-@ known computers include some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still used in the test @-@ sensitive version of IP should replace 4 version 4 in the future .

it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking on OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the module include not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , it must be set in a &amp; con@@ sole ; the following command must be dis@@ solved .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ht@@ tp : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of bin@@ ary distri@@ butions ( usually r@@ pm @-@ packages ) it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
installing the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the r@@ pm package and in a &amp; con@@ sole ; with r@@ pm as follows :
alternatively , a tool with a graphical interface can be used as a package or installation tool for your distribution .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but additionally , the development package with libraries and other libraries are needed .
this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult , &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; however , the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; change@@ able configuration files are discussed .
this section can not replace knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information on the integration of PCs will be convey@@ ed into a small ( home - ) network .
currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 5 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never seen large spread . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . this description is currently focused on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is aware of which IP @-@ address of a network interface is available . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; the workplace is the contact point , which is a valid IP address or , if available , the IP address can not be used simply any number !
when setting up a private little ( home ) network , IP address should be chosen from a specially for this purpose in order to avoid IP address accounts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwar@@ ded to the Internet , so its use is possible .
of course , access to the internet for such machines can be achieved by setting up an gat@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks , mostly addresses are used in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 168.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 168.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is big enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the network mask is usually set on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all machines are in the same sub @-@ network .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.@@ 0@@ g ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first one is the so @-@ called Standard Route , the Z@@ weite the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own computer ) . the standard route is required for the IP @-@ transmission .
the power @-@ address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP @-@ traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as a closed circle .
in this part , the configuration files are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed at DSL @-@ connections , so that it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections to find another content than defined there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; is known that this file is dropped by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it was the possibility to set up multiple archives on a tape . the first goal was to answer a question of d@@ ds@@ 2@@ tar to the fast , sel@@ ective expression . the second goal was to answer a question that was given my wife : how much longer does it take if you sec@@ ures ?
before a tape can be used , it must be incorporated by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can happen to three types :
&amp; k@@ dat ; cul@@ t the band and reads the pre@@ load information of the Ban@@ des . recogni@@ zes &amp; k@@ dat ; the anticip@@ ation on the tape are not , you will be asked if the band is to be form@@ att@@ ed .
det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the preview , looks for the appropriate index on your plate . can this not be found , you will be asked if the current index should be newly created .
if everything goes smoothly , the symbol is transformed for the belt system to indicate that the band has been incorporated . in the stat@@ eline appears a appropriate message . the contents of the belt can now be sear@@ ched through out of the item for the band .
before drawing up the ban@@ ger , first the integration must be solved . there are three methods to achieve this :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result of the symbol , there is a change in the symbol for the band that the inclusion of the band has been solved and displays appropriate message in the status bar . the band can now be raised without danger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before a tape can be used by &amp; n@@ dat ; it must be de@@ ed by &amp; c@@ dat ; form@@ att@@ ed .
a tape size must be form@@ att@@ ed before you can use to save data . this process does not correspond to the form@@ att@@ ing of your use ; it must happen before you are form@@ att@@ ed by the belt by &amp; k@@ dat ; flo@@ pp@@ y dis@@ drives are usually put a form@@ att@@ ing of the bank@@ ment , DAT @-@ drives , however .
after entering the tape and the capacity runs &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ att@@ ing of the tape . all the data on the tape are lost thereby ! after completion of the format , the belt is automatically incorporated and is ready @-@ to @-@ use .
before you encounter the backup process , you have to select the most backup files . this can happen to three types :
select a file or folder in the local file tree ; only this file or folder is secured .
highlight a backup profile in the tree . it will only be saved in the profile given in the profile .
highlight files in the local file tree with a ho@@ oks . only the marked files and / or sub@@ folder will be backed up .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select the det@@ ector in the menu ...
once the backup has been initiated , the dialog opens up settings for backup . in this dialog you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for the backup .
when you confirm the settings , the dialog shows backup . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in any of the archives in entry for the drive . it is only checked the selected file or folder .
highlight the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . they are only examined the marked files and / or sub@@ folders .
click with the right mouse button on one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
once the audit process has been started , the dialog &apos;s settings for checking . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the work@@ space for the review .
if you confirm the settings for re@@ viewing , the dialog appears to over@@ see . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the flow rate and the remaining time .
before you can establish the re@@ produce , the files , which are to be restored , marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in any of the archives , which belong to the listing to the belt system . it is restored only the selected file or sub@@ folder .
highlight the desired files from one of the archives with a ho@@ oks . it will be restored only the marked files and / or sub@@ folder .
right click on a file or a folder in one of the archives and choose to Rest@@ ore in the menu .
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog &apos;s settings for recovery . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the work level for recovery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you confirm the settings for recovery , the dialog appears to restore . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data set and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to re@@ produce the th@@ read@@ ed file with the belt content . this process del@@ etes all the existing index files for this tape . you can create the index on two types of the band :
this will create a backup profile with the currently marked files and the default settings . you can make use of the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working class in which the backup should be made . the list of the saf@@ eke@@ eping files will be automatically updated according to the currently selected working conditions .
for all the folder , which are listed under backup files , that only the files are stored in the same fil@@ esystem , such as the folder . folder , which are stored on other fil@@ esystem . each entry is viewed by tar regardless of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is saved . there are only the files stored since then .
the name of the file , which is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of the buttons are ; and lt ; and lt ; files were not completely implemented at the time of creation of this documentation .
the settings can be set on the menu item K@@ D@@ at menu ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device file for the belt works ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ vert -@@ variant of the belt .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; c@@ asser@@ tion ; before the band is involved the command will mt . at some mil@@ e@@ age this is necessary before reading or write @-@ operations can be performed .
if the option is enabled , tried &amp; k@@ ering to block the trigger at the band@@ course . possibly this setting does not work with all band@@ systems .
if the option is enabled , when lo@@ wering the inclusion of &amp; k@@ ering ; automatically the band is subject out . use this option not for Flo@@ pp@@ y streaming .
if the option is swit@@ ched , tried &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ working height for the belt works to change . not all drives support variable block@@ sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must not need &amp; be , in any case the block@@ size for your band@@ work is communicate .
when &amp; n@@ soldier ; a band form@@ att@@ ed , it writes a file to the beginning of the belt . this file should only show a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows :
( n by@@ te ) The band ID . the format of this character string is calcul@@ ator : seconds , where in@@ name of the full name of the system is dated to which the belt has been form@@ att@@ ed . seconds is the number of seconds , which has been form@@ att@@ ed since the period in which the belt has been form@@ att@@ ed .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the rest of the files on the band are pure tar archive which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar manage . even other tar -@@ versions should work , as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup band . this symbol is only active if a band is involved .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ viewer for system proto@@ cols . the program is stored for in@@ experienced users which may not know where you can get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files . in addition , you can gain access to information about problems that may occur on their server .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer does in the background makes the task of &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; is a simpli@@ fied representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users who don &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where the system depos@@ ited the different protocol files .
in addition , we also allows for example to provide information about problems related to information about problems that may occur on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced functions , using their help the protocol files to certain programs are fil@@ tered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has a number of useful features , including a number of useful features . among other things include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ s@@ log server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screens@@ hot , with their help the individual protocol @-@ lines of a log file will easily filter and sort . the individual possibilities for the s@@ orting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start tries to open &amp; ks@@ ystem log ; first of all , the main protocol @-@ file of the system - to open the system protocol . it is probably not displayed with system configur@@ ations . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the folder / var / log , for the normal users usually no justi@@ fication for reading .
you can also use the fil@@ eline in order to filter for a fixed criteria or by fil@@ tering character . the list of log files will now be displayed , so that only a log box is displayed in next to the filter . then a protocol @-@ line will only be shown if in one of the columns the string of the filter is included .
you can also select another entry on this site . for example in the log file system , select the column process and enter the filter tim@@ eline the name of a process , so shows you &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to see the important protocol lines . protocol lines of stage error will be displayed with a con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous color as a protocol @-@ line of stage indicator . the colored presentation of protocol lines can be swit@@ ched off .
if you only want to show certain process ( for example in the system protocol or on the cr@@ on protocol ) , you can use the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can then be useful if you would like to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case use fil@@ ter@@ box .
in addition , you can ski@@ p the option to translate new lines in the context menu of the main window , in order to display all the new add @-@ line lines .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files into separate sub@@ windows . to use this function , use the entries in the menu window to open up additional sub @-@ window and administ@@ er . once you selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has its own web page on ht@@ tp : / / ks@@ ystem log@@ .@@ forum @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find further up @-@ to @-@ date information about the supply sources of &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ;
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; you will also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion Archives : ks@@ ystem@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ archive
welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; system V in@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section introduces a few concepts one and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the system V in@@ it develops quickly to the standard for controlling the program start at the top of the system in the &amp; Linux ; and this is because it is easier to use , powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD inc@@ ite .
I will not go further on historical aspects here ( e.g. because I do not know about it : - ) .
the in@@ it bin@@ ary file lies under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to put a machine on system V , without a re@@ installation and re @-@ format . that &apos;s why you need to make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V in@@ it also diff@@ ers from BSD in@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc , instead of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for each system service that you want to start running the system or when switching to a different running system . system services include such things like networks , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , ht@@ t@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such stuff as set@@ tra , which will only be started . such views are named after r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be in turn on / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even though it does not have much use for it . you can also let a r@@ c.@@ se in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something to do with the serial port .
the kernel searches for various locations after the program in@@ it and starts the first one you find .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ y . you should see in the initial area a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably discover that the default run@@ way 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can perform / etc / in@@ itt@@ le from hand and change the 3 . be very careful when you go to in@@ itt@@ ating modifications . if you have something to go through , then you will fix it by re@@ boot the system and execute the following :
but how does it all start the correct scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will probably see something like the following :
you will notice that in this folder there are no real files . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
as starts and stop in@@ it actually system services ? very simple : each of the scripts is so written that it is an argument as start and stop . you can actually start this script from hand at the command line :
this would hold the ht@@ t@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when a K includes , the script is called with the argument stop . if it includes an S , the script is called with the argument .
some people wish to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; one server -@@ Run@@ off , which can only run ht@@ t@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . , moreover , I could also have a user -@@ Run@@ off , which &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc .
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; you should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or other po@@ char@@ geable device is simple to not say tri@@ vial , simply drag an entry from the area of the availability system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can change script also between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within a level by moving it elsewhere . thereby , the entry is removed from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this will only happen if it will draw an entry in the area of the availability system services .
note : entries are del@@ ayed when you drag them into a new section . to copy them on a new running level , you must explicitly select cop@@ ying out of the menu item or paste the context menu , even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the promotion .
the sor@@ row of a item can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the s@@ orting entries of the surrounding entries , before you can once again try to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to re@@ produce items that have been thrown in the tr@@ ash . therefore , be careful .
you can use the Tab@@ ulator key to activate the different work@@ spaces ( Avail@@ able System@@ services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to post@@ p@@ one entry into another running level , move it with out into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X use ) and add it into the desired running level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sor@@ row numbers or the name of an entry manually , press the input button to switch the Properties dialog . use the Tab@@ ulator button to accept the dialog box , in order to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to throw the changes .
because of the danger of data loss , all entries in the menu file require a confirmation , before they are running .
all settings will be stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets will be taken to the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) . otherwise they are operated by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; restored . changes to the pres@@ ets are stored in a local sy@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n and now the machine starts in @-@ resistant new . what can I do ?
type LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single one and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default run@@ level at a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be ok ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; designed to execute under Run@@ level X , but they will not be carried out .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual for distribution .
the way , how system services are launched in these distri@@ butions , however , simpli@@ fied the configuration for the propri@@ etary uniqu@@ eness of this distri@@ butions but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you use any other distribution : please check if all configuration files are available ( and whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ t@@ p@@ d ) simply end without notice if its configuration files are not available or wrong .
the importance of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the running level so that this manual can be added .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation by &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
