<seg id="19">In Darling algorithms for Treemaps, the general rule should be proportional to the size of the item. at the Treemap in & FSView, this goal is not always to be observed. there will be a frame that will then no longer be available to the loss of entries. please note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle square is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As splitting the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is provided, implementation is left. here, it is crucial to allocate the areas such as possible, that jurisdictions arise, which are as square-shaped. the best methods in this regard are lines, columns or record-division.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimal area for an entry on the menu entry insert in area. instead, a caterpattern in the area of an orderly listing is drawn to indicate that this area is actually covered by an assigned entry.</seg>

<seg id="148">Metadata are defined as data about data. metadata in accordance with your definition of data that provide information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you need more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you need to find out more than 1000 photos on your computer. if you do not even know how many photos you have, then use not sure how many photos you have, then use very fast soups and a secure archiving on which you can access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you do and need to know before you need anything into your system. you have to decide whether other access to your photos should be stored on your computer or on a network drive & etc. make sure you have to switch to a larger drive.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you'll be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can be found quickly over your location. if you were able to organize enough photos, then you will subfolder as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; use. export is a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as reversioning of the photos, archiving, job creation, constant import of images on different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% employment are deleted and you will not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">Which types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the stacking simple. separate new of old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files are simplified a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original one or a derivative picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the option metadata to save in the setup page of the metadata in & digicame; this ensures that Exif- and IPTC data will be written into the file. if you forget it, then you can save the metadata out of the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the menu album.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which? to make it a metadata editor available for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now, the real work begins, since you should now pick any photo keywords, marking and score. of course, you can select all the images that will need the same attribute and set the value then. you start the best with the rating or ranking. this makes sense, since you can focus on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's now let us take keyword, keyword, as you often called on other programs, or categories. all three are Synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import katalogue images from another source of embedded keywords, then the tree for you will build the images in the right place. the resort of Hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can simply be settled by the pull of a subtree on another. the modified keywords will be done by & digicame; updated while it pursues the sub-trees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata vassed itself. this is a very grobe representation, since each block of metadata in truth consists of many sections. filenames and calendar dates refer to properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to complaints or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">Do you want most anyone to simply see your photos, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographer and agencies. they are certainly interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer you start looking at some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this the cross space of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after the landing. Wow! you start to dream, associations, memories, the historical time span is again present, you might even hear the silence. so your perception of this panoramas has completely changed.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who consider your photos, the title is possibly more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show images you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transfer the importance to the viewer, to help Him understand about the motif that you have moved to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine when a picture is not perfect if it has the strength to work alone with just a label for himself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digicame; you can use as much text, in a globalized Alphabet (UTF-8), as being printed. KDE even provides you with a spell checker. you can even tell it for your wishes into the marking and / or the title of the web-gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet before GoogleEarth? good, because with images the train moves the spatial presentation now already with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities for Geolocation utilisation are already countless, and will be able to repeat in the future. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can open your travel virtually through photographs with geographical references. you can also export images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps spectator.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a match with copyright and calls on the practice the copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms are also in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the setup page of & digicame; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should add your name, or the name of the person who has created the photo, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization has been used, it should not be changed. this field neither commas nor semicolons are supported as separators.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autortitel (synonym for author line): associated with the author. examples of this field contains the name of the photographer. examples of this can be titles as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or indeer commercial photographer. as this is a note to the Authors area, this field must be well-filled.</seg>
<seg id="174">Editors (synonym for vendors): use the provider to identify who works there. if the photographer is working here, the photographer can be listed here. if the photographer is listed here, the image is a camp site, then the image / agency will display the image here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright offences, although this is no protection against abuse. anyone who uses a little more than basic knowledge within the work with calculator, can delete or change. the solution to this problem are digital watermarks. for individuals, this protection is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important against this.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique in the picture. & digifted; in the near future, such module is available for stacker processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: PLATTENFEHLER, plate, ECC, transmission errors, transmission of storage media, restoration, redundancy, lifespan, temperature, data size, widespread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we are not talking about CDs that are lost on the street or brand. these kinds of losses are the same that may happen to you with traditional paperpictures or negative. in this section about problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest database company in the world, has some interesting statistics which causes a loss of data.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs must be treated cautious and can no longer be bought as a couple of years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in the archive quality. there are offers of gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for yourself. whether you believe this lies in your messenger.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be readable, but you can use this risk in which you will use good decks and good recording facility. the best DVD recording facility are not much more costly than the cheapest but you write much reliable. so it turns to select the right one.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to mistakes, even if you have just written it. therefore, they use a control mechanism to defend oneself. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control parameters. despite this massive protection, they use by chemical ageing, ultrviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For broken CDs and DVDs, there are a favorable program called IsoBuster which apparently causes miracles for CDs and DVDs. it also runs under Windows and & Linux; but there are also similar applications that damaged data from damaged diskettes, disks, fboards, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical Media: Blu-ray discs to win the Formatism to win HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost sixsmal the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that has been said to CDs and DVDs and of course also applies to Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording unit on high quality media in a non-proprietary format. read the media using a description, date & author characteristic and afterwards to a clean, dark dry and especially animals protected place. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Floppers reserve your statistics for you. your manufacturing mechanisms include a new disk, but not the data. Google represents a large field study on the error-mechanisms of hard drives: diserrors study</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: disks keeping up the longest in Temperature Since from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. electronic parts of the Controllers are the most common error item, SMART may not notice this error. some of the SMART defects must not cancel the immediate forthcoming incident. these are particularly lesbian and publisher. the expected lifetime time is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is just about the complete verest due to overload. of course, you may also have data loss due to a blackout before you have secured the files, but these losses normally allow themselves to recover without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices electric breaches no much, it looks different in devices with computer chips and high-speed processes. these can cause heavy damage, hardware replacement, destroyed motherboards, and other defects, thus protecting yourself from unavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against power tips is an overload protection. this is a device that absorbed part of energy heat and the rest grounded. it is usually available in the form of a socket. however, you don't think any plug-in bar also contains an overload protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overload protection, then you should be careful that he meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also pay attention to the protection against lightning stroke and thus protects the correctly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Because a overload of each cable can use to your computer, you should be sure that even all the peripherals can be connected to your system. some manufacturers generate overload-load, which also includes a telephone connection for your modem. others provide connectivity options for the coaxial cable of cable modems and television card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overload protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks, and therefore they also contain the protection for the modem. therefore, you are ideal for travelling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overload protection protects your system from smaller fluctuations into the power lines, it will not really help you with a complete loss. even a fall of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. therefore it can therefore be sensible to invest in a uninterrupted power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">Besides the protection from overload these devices, these devices can be automatically stored battery power. some models allow them to save your data and keep the system ordered again. if you're buying a USV then you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements as an overload protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the attached software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Raise the potential risk that your billing system is exposed to and and compare its security with electricity disruptions with the cost of avoiding this. a high quality overload protection can take you up to & euro; 20. this is just a small price difference if you think how well your machine is protected so you should remember all cables once you drive to the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web-Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - einen easy storage service. with the right configuration you can use this as drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are compared to hard drives, however very expensive - 40 GB costs & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data on the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution to a local loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com are at your disposal. your free memory is available to 1 GB and you will not have your images available in full resolution online. the professional version provides you more in case of Flickr dramatically more. for $25 per year you get unrestricted memory, which should only be reviewed in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of the data protection the Web-solutions are very secure. transmission errors are certified thanks to the TCP protocol and included in the large companies it will contain a backup and an integrated memory. that's why they are desasterased.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calculator. all the transmissions are prone to transmission errors. the filesystem and bust provide at least the database integrity between operating systems and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that you no one says when a transmission error occurred, not if this occurred in your hardware. it's quite disturbing that there should be no protection in your computer. no one seems to have not meant to have. the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer place than the inside your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission loss as they produce interference within the data currents. in normal filesystems these errors stay unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not currently affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who are able to deal with turntables on a lower level and is available under a GPL-compatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is soon available for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with its btral filesystem. this is still in the Alpha status. it uses the same protective mechanisms and is available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebook and 46% in the job systems. notebooks are already the percentage of the theft of 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most of them. it results in a lower damage, such as theft or reinstallations. and it is currently being limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been spotted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open Source Dateisysteme are less prone to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFs, JFS and XFS to call the spread file systems. a very good English article on this can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigating process during a sudden break is higher and an undefined status will be avoided if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft, and human errors are the root causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Digital cameras are removed from digital cameras, 1-2 aperture displays from fundamental physical limits. it is that the technology continues to develop there is a natural border for this progress. sensitivity and smokers of all types of light sensors are no longer far away from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today cameras go towards the 10 Megapixel picture. even if this resolution is too high for compass cameras and the end result is the optimum for compactor cameras. even DSLR Cameras have the limit at 10-12 Megapixel. for higher resolution, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive today get you today for 100 & euro; therefore, do not make anyone else responsible for data losses. so, make your data often after a plan and test this backup before you make irrelevant anything like the reinstallation of your operating system, the exchange of plates or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make daily use of your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a bolt will have you lucky if the drive has not been connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster moves locally and destroyed a lot. forget aircraft unsglücke: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they normally concern a whole room or the complete house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, Desasterronement means always a local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above is a frequent reason for a loss of data despite the backup of panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be secured. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential Equations: a backup of the files has been modified since the last complete assurance. creates a complete momentum to two periods: the complete assurance and the last differing assurance.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been modified since the last backup. generates several times. you can restore the original status at any time in which such a backup has been made. this backup comes up to a version system next with the exception that it is only camasted and is not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike the script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file shell scripts, sync just the difference of files that really have been changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase security through ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important pictures directly after you have stored on your computer to DVD or other optional medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure will allow you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time you come to securing a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, in the image file stored IPTC information, Associated XMP files, original, memory, scalability, media, refinding images and metadata, copy of images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualisation, devices,..., use of Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">Therefore valuable pictures survive the next 40 year, that is about the time span in which you really are interested in, because they remember your childhood and youth, there are two strategies that should be respected:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable because of your nature you need to see everything that is said today. unfortunately, there is no other way than a certain vigilance to leave. unfortunately, there is no other possibility as the current system is backwards compatible. the less variations you have used in the past, the more readily available is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered through the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is nowadays available for everyone. therefore, if you have an old system that is important to reading your pictures, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the professional way for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means ever growing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's take the scalability and you want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition. at * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and shift to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new record was detected by the system, but do not hang them off.</seg>
<seg id="235">£/ dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdb, the new record is / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate in MBytes; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & Dollar; / dev / sad / 1 # change the size of refractures if needed</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software is available, you can read it yourself. this task will be easier for year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that will slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was used as an open source standard of GIF. it can be more funny, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC Metadata, 16-bit per colour-channel information, but not as many as TIFF needs and a slow compression. this format we would like to recommend you for storing your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as picture format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a dissient compression salsioned mus (Deflate). a problem is however that this format has been adapted by many people. therefore, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digitale Negative file format is a licence-free and open raw material that has been developed from Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to the use of Metadata. a handful of camera bodies are already available and we hope you will use the co-competition Canon and Nikon it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a marker of XML; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archiving a original of your recording, mostly in the raw format, to archive. however, it may result in the link between the metadata and the image file, and as above noted the raw material. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything there together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization working for fully compatible online metadata standards, including the activities of DCMI communities and the DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and enlightening efforts to reach a far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the maps or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera eedium, you can use this as temporary assurance.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a subtle processing, you can use external programs. if you edit the images again with & digival; edit, then you should add the metadata again. these were cut under circumstances from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited paintings for copyright with a digital watermark. export them only to webgalleries, fuse in MPEG, use in contakt, print & etc.</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digival; to get in the section adding pictures to an album you can add a description as you have already on your hard disk. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import images to your album database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digifted; connect them to the computer, turn the camera on the ad mode and turn it off. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, this tries to connect with your camera. if the connection is made, a Fertig indicator is available at the bottom and the preliminary images of all photos on the camera will display. some cameras do not represent a previewer. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol of the file order for each file, photos, movies, music etc. on the camera appear.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information to each entry. with the side characteristics and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an item or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file characteristics and the photo information to be stored internally by the camera. a symbol shows that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that with some digital cameras do not provide all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider Metadata shows the internal metadata such as exif, producer, GPS etc. the image. this information is the same as for the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digicame; or picture editing. note that these metadata are not available with some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer, the click on the button Download and then download the selection of All. this releases photos from your camera into a single album in & digival;. in downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures are safe to delete in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can select only the desired with the standard choice methods of & kde; select the button below and then download the chosen button. the button chosen can be downloaded, until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera is supported this, an option is now available. these images have been downloaded by & digival; in this case the new pictures have been selected with a star in the showcase. if you choose this option, course, only the new images are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you want to download the buttons, you can download the target album, displayed in which the photographs are shown. the list of existing albums is displayed just like normal folder. select the target album out of the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you selected the target album, press OK, and & digifted; load the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once by using the button Clear. if you want to delete only a few, then you must select this first and then delete the delete chosen.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there is no way you have deleted from the camera to restore it. so you should carefully review whether the photos were successful in a & digival; -Album have been downloaded, before you want to delete them from the camera. if you want to delete it from camera, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as a filename for the photos often not particularly expressive names. the filename are normally rectified, after taking photographs of the camera deleted. this can be used to double filename in the same album. therefore, it can be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was made to integrate into the filenames.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirror-based subcategories. if you use this latter option, a folder per day is automatically created.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transmission opens three more options that are performed prior to the photos stored on the record. the first two concern the data about the author in the section standard readability. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the terms included in the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct the date & time for all downloaded photos.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you prefer a different format format than standard format, you can use the prefix Foto-% Y-% N:% M:% S. place your option date & time. for further modifications you should read the help of command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera stream name, you will have the option to change the filenames in small shopping letters. or in large letters, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digicame; used for a photo, it is displayed below the name that the camera is available in the preview. your settings for renaming are stored and automatically used when you open the camera stamp next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digicame; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to the time point of recording. not all cameras are ready to perform. in the section sidebar Metadata you can read further details, about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic spin-off is usually switched, and if your camera is not providing this information, the photo is in its original orientation. if you want to switch off the automatic filming, use the button Schweitzer and select the automatic spin in the bottom section of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera is made available via the date on which the photo has been made available, it can be used to download thisalbum. all images with the same date are loaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras are provided with the same date. in the section sidebar Meta data you can read what information your camera could be embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually off, and in this case saves & digicame; the photos directly on the target album. if you want to change this option, you need to turn this option. use the button filename at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The simplest way to load photos from their computers to their camera is the knob. select a button. the file selection dialog & kde; it appears, in which you can select the files that should be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">Once the selection is done, asks & digicame; you know where the images will be loaded up. a folder selections for the camera appears. select here the desired folder and press OK to load the uploading. the images are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. therewith, a position is designed to be indicated in longitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. the identification of the data can be carried out by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers, it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical place. not everyone uses a plane to account a area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planer, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have later forgotten where exactly the photo has been made, you can click with a click a browser to locate the area. if you want to locate a postcard to another & digival; users just want to locate the location of the photographs, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to send the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data get into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 many GPS data fields are supported, such as the data in these fields? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the correct hardware, via reprocessing the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for the geographical assignment (manual) and lastly via the manual entry of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there are currently no camera integrated with GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receiver. either as the ticket module or transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS-Interface: CoySanEye Ipaq Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can take place with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you must store these data in gpx format as this is the only format which is supported by the module for the geographical assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS which can extract the data from pictures and GPS and correlate it. on the following page you can make the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitudinal and longitudinal or other data, then you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the sign of coordinates, such as maps.google will be created.</seg>

<seg id="294">By default, the image processing has a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can use the toolbar to use the toolbar in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or brighter color in the picture. these colours can be specified here. in picture editing this connection mode can be inserted and switched with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">Chroma-Subsampling is meant that images can be coded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in color formations. please read this article in Wikipedia about the nearer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With adjustment PNG-compression, you can reduce the size of PNG. this surgery does not reduce the image quality, since PNG uses a veritable algorithm. if you have a quick machine, you can put this value on high compression. it means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option TIFF files compress you can turn the Deflate -Compressionsalgist m for TIFF images. this reduces the size of TIFF images. it has no influence on the image quality, since the Deflate -algorithm works disable.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting of funny JPEG-2000 files you can be dissicated. even if you choose the disable setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than when the normal JPEG. when this paragraph has been written, metadata still was not supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the previous versions of & digicame; the image processing only was a photo-view for photos. currently, it develops very quickly to a tool for manipulation of your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of the editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default notation is that all green pixels are identical. if you use this option as the Pixel pattern in the output. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimum loss of details. this option identifies the picture a little soft, eliminates but the 2x2 mash pattern with the VNG- or the AHD-quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">When this option is set, the whitish is used immediately by the camera. otherwise, if it is set, the automatic balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white equals is not set. standard is it a fixed dybalance, which was photographed on a white map which was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed pictures in four steps in four steps. for other cameras, this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is it the spelter, so the parts of your images are burned down, due to the inability of your camera to capture the cutting edge, as it shows the spelling in various rosatoms. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of missing information from the ledge.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast satious as green and red. & crab therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still unsaturated blue pixel. of course, this is a matter how much colour or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">When you select the option, you get the option to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adapted for each picture individually.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the Luminous value according to your taste. you probably have to put it a bit higher than the standard 1. but this can also be done later in the image options of the & digiing; image processing. to keep the time for deosaicing small, you should do more conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is an digital image process to expect a complete picture of the sub-file sensor which have many cameras and which is known to a matrix of colored pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA-Interpolation or Farbrekonstruction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& Dcrab introduces you three alternatives: Bilinar, VNG interpolation and AHD Interpolation (for adaptive homogeneity), however, was the first algorithm that was used by DVikf. however, it generates colartefacts at edges. Bilinar is interesting if you are looking for a quick fix with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the colorimation of your lentils you can put the red and blue-proof values here. this is certainly the best method for a different colour correction, since you are performed during the pipe-test.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translated the color information and gives instructions how to be given again. there is also LCMS and & digicame; information such as the colour formations of one color tree in the other are to be interpreted as accurately as possible.</seg>

<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit in the same way. not all profiles are included on the same type. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain shade mapping or gamble-correction. currently correct dcraw Gamma does not exist for conversions at 16 bit depths. this means you need to perform the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft Proof profile, with which you can emulate as your printer can be released from one device. this is very useful before you can print, since your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors therefore have very saturated with it. you could manually correct it instead of rely on the blinding algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obviously which colour profile is provided for what is provided for. unfortunately, not in the models of Canon. therefore there is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is obviously inofficial:</seg>

<seg id="338">The picture processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digival; therefore, they are not part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules can be found in paragraph of picture editing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the filename, current data entry, enlarging factor and the actual image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and among them the toolbar for quick access to the most commonly used functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of picture processing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photograph before you use the original image or the button save from the toolbar. remember that you cannot recover the original photo once you have saved the original image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should possibly be able to make a copy of your image before you change it. you can save yourself with file storing.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by reproduce the original image by reproduce the button. you then lose any change that you have performed in the photo since the last time.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any action of the editing process can be undone or restored, the last action can be undreversible by recling recling or restored by selecting Edit from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you often use this, you should remember the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to return and make Ctrl; -Shift Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">When you press the & LMB; over the back-up or re-made button in the toolbar one moment longer press, get an account menu. if you select one of the menu items, all actions in between also reversible and restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the picture editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keywords, using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, picture high, picture runter or the entries in the menu file, you are asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can play in the photo and out zooming in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the similar menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust to a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: enlarging factor automatically.</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode shows the photo in full-screen mode. you come in the normal view where you can use the Esc button. normally, you can also change this in the setup dialog by & digival; you can call this from the & digival; main window. see the section for setting the picture editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current picture, you can select the image file and get the standard & kde; print dialog. you can adjust here settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">Out of the main menu, you can print out individual images or whole sets. all images can be printed from your selection. you only need to select the images with the default methods and select from the menu album printing assistants. if you follow the assistants, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">This window has a sidebar on the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected pictures. the same sidebar is available without the navigation bar, even in image processing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multi-mould click on for the same tab lets the sidebar appear and again disappear into the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the description view, you can insert terminations with unlimited size or insert. notice the remark below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed to be used in the EXIF- and IPTC- fields, so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments will be cut back to 2000 characters and special characters are reformed. if you want to use the IPTC description field in other applications, you should notice these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After which you have commented you will use either the knob or simply change to the next picture, the bill is then stored.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the use button, there is a button More. with this you can read further metadata about the selected file or the database. however, you can also use the metadata into the files. but this will always be done if you have selected a metadata stream that is always written to the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section assessment shows a review of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and variety. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar, or using the keyboard shortcut. to evaluate multiple images simultaneously, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written into the IPTC field urgency. the coding follows the diagram in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword shows a search box on the filtering of the keywords, the keywords, and a selbox with the previously mentioned in this & digival; a session referred to.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keywords will be adjusted to the one-given search password. you can easily restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword rapidly. this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is another relief to enter keywords at a picture series. if you have given various keywords, these are stored for fast access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be stored by flagging of the corresponding fields of fields in the tree. all tags of an image are stored into the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the folder tree, this only will be used to the protupscale image and not to the whole selection, if you want a selection with a keyword, please read the section keyword filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images shown on the main window. normally the left sidebar is used with their record, - Datum-, keynote and search views. if additionally, one or more keyword filter from the right is shown, only the subset of these two displays will be available only. all keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and place. suppose you've already selected in the main view several pictures to put you with keywords, then you can simply drag it out of the right sidebar and put on the selection. then, a dialog appears, you ask if you want to put the keywords.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the top example, the main window shows the images at a calender date. the keywords will be reduced to three pictures. they were selected with Strg + a and then a keyword was drawn from the right keyword on the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword shall be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for modifications will take place during each start of the program. you can also be switched to settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and find that it should be a or be, you can easily change this with a double-click on the text and in the control range.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry, after which in the database is sought. this can be an album, name, keyword, picture, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument to the operator, which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">You can e.g. specify a Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you just need to use the cross field at the end of the rule and then use the button group. the options see as follows:</seg>

<seg id="377">The reason why you use a colored workflow using the colors of your camera or scanner, you can achieve a preutable variations from the actually photographed or scanned color. with a colorfully automatic workflow you can achieve that colors on your monitor you can download or the colors you print or on the web you publish from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme comes on shade administration, everyone wants to press what buttons it must express for the results he wants. unfortunately, the purpose of this tutorials can provide you adequate background information about colour management. additionally, you should provide links with deeper information that you obtain the required result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all the criteria listed above, you don't have to worry about colors.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor which is calibrated to the sRGB-Farbraum. (more information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image expenditure are by email or the Web, where sRGB of de facto standard is.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy, why should one use another color tree and make your thoughts about hamen?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of Limitation of sRGB compared to the colours we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colours that we can see, the horseshoe region, and the colors in the sRGB Farbraum, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensionals representation of sRGB with some larger farms, please visit Bruce Lindbloom excellente page and then click on Info and then information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to imagine my monitor if I decided to work only in the sRGB Farbraum?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working at sRGB-Farbraum, or not, you will need to shed your monitor. if you are working as in the color tree of sRGB, you have to select either your monitor to the sRGB standard, a suitable monitor profile, or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic revisions available to improve the image in most cases. therefore, use it before you try a further manual work.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, comparisons, automatic downstream and contrast expand out of the menu of the rigid automatic correction try automatically out of your colors to make the best. they will be experimenting with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scale the luminous values above the entire picture, so the darkest point black and the lightest point to change as bright as possible without its color gradation. this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Alternating: this method is adjustable the illuminated colour of the colours of the selected image, so that the histograms of introductible is as flat as possible. this makes it very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces a very powerful operation, which causes either wonder at an image or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic in the same: this method maximizes the color area in the red, green and blue-channel. you will find the dark and light limits and adjust the red, green and blue channels on the complete histogrammage range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast extend: this method improves the contrast and the luminous values of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values on the widest possible field and a new jiustling of all values in between. this is only visible in balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white-gate of & digicame; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white straight out of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-right correction is somewhat limited because over a color tree with 8-bit per colour can occur. in case you can proceed too far from the original image. if you are able to perform the white-off in the raw mode, which is working in the 16-bit mode, then your possibilities for correction is better off.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white margin of copyright from Pawel T. Jochym. they start using the menu-entry colors White-equal to image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The presumshowcase can be adapted to the size. on the left side are the original image as well as preview the target image. the Preview is always adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white off, it is enough to click the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target hotel has red marker. the Luminancy of the Pixels below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in histogrammes.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right top is a histogrammar is displayed as soon as you change one parameter. this histogrammar is very helpful, even in well lit pictures, most pixels are very small Luminous values. with one button you can decide if one of the three colours or your total is indicated. the sum is called Luminancy.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your outcome depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow blurry lets you improve the sattendings of your photos or also download it.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat play with the above controls, you should use the colour temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere to the picture preview for the calculation of the color temperature of the white deallocation. this type will also set the temperature and green values automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white straight away with the list of presets. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The oversight of indikator increases the colors when more than one color-channel of the Pixels is overexposed.. you will display the combined result in the white background. this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons, as well as charging make this exactly this. each setting of the white decks you have set before you can save it into a text file and then load back.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button preset sets all filter values back to their standard values and the corresponding neutral white lock. note that also neutrale settings will be displayed as your original. if you save it, your original image will change.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set here the codiver of the beetched image. 8-bit coding is the widespread JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high quality pictures. however, this coding is also needed more graphing, calculating time and is onent for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialogue as for the processing of raw materials. it uses the change and transfer of color profiling. color mapping can be performed by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed guide to the use of color profiling, you can extract the chapter administration.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the menu under colors audio-correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple shades at the same time. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always make the same mistake and therefore you will always find the same correction. you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">To correct a very powerful possibility of correct blems, the tool for Gradation is that you can find under colors Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"" "that & digifted; tool Farbeffective gives you four colour effects, a solar panel, a neon-effect and a cantenfilter at its disposal." ""</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, solar power, also Sabatier referred to, an effect of the originator was created by the additional light. this was the effect that the light-light areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second lighting. the result was a part of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar power. at about 50% intensity, the picture shows what chemically possible. a further increase is finally generated an negativity that cannot be generated on photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of solar energy efficiency. the original image is the (1) and the process (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid-Filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquoth; -effect. it differs from a satiation to make it a stronger contracted effect that makes the colors brilliant and glow. try it simple, he embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the trademark name for a daylight added color film created by the Japanese company FUJIFILM. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquoth; and with it a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated color, but as well as a reference for nature photographers. Velvias strongly complex colors are but also some photo graphs, especially those who barely cover landscapes, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilter simulates Neonlight on the contrasts. the parameter levels controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeats the strength of the neon. with large images, the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to correct the color-trash and the luminance of the photo. you can view the experiment with the different color blocks of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can get a photo in bad light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: one too big saturation. even in this case, the tool for brightness is a good choice to increase satiation instead of increasing. all changes you can perform in the preview. if you like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool Gradation and the simple lamp-strength / contrast / gamma is the tool sound correction to improve the exposure. also, if the dialog based on this tool is very complicated, you need to explain the area of the slider. concrete the three Schieber below the Historic Program.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window provides a graphs of the intensability, a histograms, of active sewer or selected enclosures. under the graphs are three scents to be clicked and which can be moved to change the voicing values of the picture. the left side represents the dark ones and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to postpone the Regulators and take care of how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right, the original and preview of the picture can be seen. the preview is dynamic, updated with the settings of the picture, updated. on the left side are the following options available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selbox can be adjusted, whether the histogram is depicted with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for pictures the large areas of a constant color includes the linear histograms is dominated by a single pillar. in this case the logarithmic version is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three Regulators: the top for the dark Tones, the middle for the bright sounds and the lowest for the middle-notes, often called gammamarks.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colours can be used in Previewing the original image, to automatically readed the input values of shadows, middle and light tones automatically. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two Regulators used to change the output values Interactive as with the input values, e.g. to create a hidden picture as a background to see while something else is seen in the background.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this knob the image values will be automatically set depending on the intensity of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and store: with these buttons, the values stored in the filesystem and later reloaded, the Gimp level is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three colours will use the input values automatically for all the shade, means and Sundays. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image for the press, green, blue, and the Luminous channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposed indikator controls all colour channels to display overexposed pixel and you can display the combined result of all channels. this is a indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and Alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left side the half of the original and the target can be displayed. the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right hand, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifications: this selbox allows it to enter the channel which is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Besides this casket, two symbols will change between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures that are captured using a digital camera, linear mode creates a broad beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode will help with the logarithmic mode.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you move for example a short-board to the right, for example the bright sounds, then you can see that these bright sounds can be corresponding with darker output and that the image image becomes darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">At the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see. if you want to change this markings on the corner you want to adjust is a suitable line on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it and down until the value is aligned according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and store: with these buttons, you can do exactly this. each bend that you created can now be stored in the filesystem and later loaded. the file format is The Gimp Short format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three colours of the curve automatically create the checkpoints of the curve for all channels of the shadow, middle and Sundays. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the checkpoints for the red, green, blue, and Luminous curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overexposed indikator controls all colour channels to display overexposed pixel. if in more than one channel overexposed pixel, you get the combined result displayed. here it is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-white photo, which was corrected in Luminanzkanal. Schatten- and Sundays was set with the color menu and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The canal-blender of the & digival; picture processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the color gradations of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of images. you can edit it from the menu color channel blender of the editing editing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel box you can select the color for the histograms: this gives you a first reference as you can correct the channels by clicking the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be seen as a comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position this in the picture a vertical line in histograms will display the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are right below: regulator for red, green and construction allow you to blend these channels. this is particularly useful when you can also change the corresponding paint components, as the channel mixer then DAS tool for generating great black conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color comes to a visible sound, which does not occur at the same point in the shade of color and whose spatial patterns look different from each channel. if that's the case, you can improve your Monochrome and improve it in which you reduce the color.</seg>
<seg id="447">The storks as well as loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any blender setting can save you for later and then load. used file format is the Gimp channel Mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposed indikator controls all colour channels to display overexposed pixel and you can display the combined result of all channels. this is a indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the Luminancy option is enabled. the original image is under (1) and the image was shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your level of abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a shift, since color pictures can be easily converted to the computer. even with a set of film profiles.</seg>

<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white filtration with a green Linsenfilter. this looks good at all scenarios and fits especially well with portraits against the sky. thus similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) Grünfilter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Oranges: simulated a black / white filtering filter with a orange Linsenfilter. this increases landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. thus similar to 002 Cokin (tm) Orangeilter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Round-filter: simulates a black / white filtering with a red light filter. this creates dramatic rather distorphosis and can simulate lunar cell-time. thus similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Gelbfilter: simulates a black / white filtration with a yellow linsenfilter. this is the most natural color-tone correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) Yellow-filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: generates warm bright and medium tones whilst it adds a bit cold in the shade of a prints and the re-development in a sepore saver. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digival; tool texture uses you can apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, whether it is a color picture or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the Stich of an old master, a pop Art portrait out of enlarged points or as a wall picture on a wall. the menu entry image texture uses the image processing can be used for this.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right raises the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of texture in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper Texturefekt has been applied to the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2). the parameters relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digival; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a beholder in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. a way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative element. this is a psychological barrier to the streaking eye. under the picture frame the module can be started from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired cream type for your image. therefore, the image with a colored line, Niepce embraces it with a nice three-dimensional frame of the ideal for a bone-effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specify width of the frame in percent. the value range for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">That with the frame decorative picture will be bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing images, especially if you have used the tool after sip ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool you can insert simple a formatted text into an image at any place. this also goes to several places when you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply type the text and place it with your mouse. use text device, orientation, color from the color tree and the character set with its characteristics as you need. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half-sighted background. already, the image is ready.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any adjustment that you have chosen for your text may be changed until you press the button "OK." after the picture once was saved, the text is part of the picture. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digival; tool for sale you can put an option over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image to apply in picture editing can be used to create more than one picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the Stencil there are no limitations regarding size and orientation. however, if you want to add the PNG file format and should add with maximum compression (9) to reduce the file size of the Stencil, just send an e-mail in English at the & digicame; mailingliste digicame-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for first time, you need to put your stencil buttons with the button base folder. select the folder in which you have copied the stencil files. these settings are marked for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">Once the root folder has been set for the stencils, appears to be a building management that reflects the folder structure of the stencil folder. the selection of a folder updated the pretext of the stencils automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnifier factor and position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button is enlarged, the opposite picture. it is centred around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Crushing the underlying image. it is arranged around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you need to enlarge the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move this button to postpone the image below the Stencil below. take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then automatically be adapted to the viewing size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digicame; three different tool at your disposal. each one of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but especially in dark areas, granting images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharpable maske works on the contrast of the edges by an image sharper. in fact, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric mansions and it's doing here a really good job. the algorithm was taken out of Gimp and it is protected by copyright from Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Relocating is possibly the best of the three because it really enhances the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adjust.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalized images need a correction of sharpness. these elements are smaller than the resolution are becoming a common color. the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually need more detrimental scaring as normal cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG-images it is often applied to a camera internal sliding. pictures in the raw-format, on the other hand, must always be stored during the processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners apply a sharpener already during the reading of the picture. if you disable this, you get in control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can obtain readable results by blur a photo with the sharpening provocals. you can call with the software application Corrigid sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should therefore deal with caution because the results are not very natural: the sharpening increases the sharpness of edges, but also intensifies the noise. in general, the needed technique for sharpening a picture is the tool relocating. you can find it on the menu entry Correviewer. taking a refund, you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it is tougher. use the tool for softens with the menu item Corrigid Corsofter and experiment with you something with settings. the presumersion on the right of the dialogue will show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blur masking is a very good tool to remove seils of your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview can help edit the image. the showcase shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, radius and amount. the standard values often produce good results and should first try the effect. an increase in radius or the amount will reinforce the effect. if you create the unsharpness mask, ruffles and the impression of fry are getting close by sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels are affected by the filter on each side of a cante. high-resolution images allow greater radios. therefore, images are best sharpened in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage being added between the original and the simplified image of the original one. thus, the strength of sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference. one can thus define a minimum difference in order for a channel of filters. in this way areas with a soft switch between the killing, and therefore Schönheitsbug in faces, celandles and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the working picture (2). unsharp mascot was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and one threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digival; tool relocating relocates a picture by enhancing the sharpness. it used the copyrighted unprotected unfolding filter-algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to create an image & quot; refokussian quot; in which it makes a better approach than just trying to raise the photo. refocus usually reaches better results as unsharp masking. you can start it from the menu by revoke colors Refokussionist in picture editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice the circular circuit works much better than the Gauß'sche Faltung. the Gauß'sche Faltung has a very long tail, which depends far from the original pixel. the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gauß's Faltung is even affected very strongly from the remote pixels. the causes of unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular cutting. it is the main parameter to use this module. for most images it should be the default value 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image should be very blurred, but should be careful on virgin.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: a raise of the correlation can help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be chosen by 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values nearby 1, & eg; maintain and cut. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharptive effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Smoking filter: an increase in the smoke filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 but rarely helpful. if the smoke filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a usable value is 0.03. a high value is even further polluted.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gaudy's sharpening: this is the radius for the Gauß'sche Schärfe. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value inequal to zero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the smoke filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Die-Size: this value determines the size of the transationsmatrix. an increase of the die-size can produce good results, especially if you choose great values for the circular shell or the Gauß'schen Schärfe. however, however, that the module will be very slow if you choose great value for these parameters. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The storks as well as loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any relocating parameter which you have set will be stored for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all the cuts, color and intensability to perform in the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but left out unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read images and compress, eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed picture.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally producing blurred masks for better results as sharpening. this could be caused by being the blur masking into a larger neighborhood as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, I have to blur blurred masks always produce artefacts. even under optimal conditions it is never possible to remove the effect of the sharpness. virtually is the result of FIR Wiener Filters at least as good as the unsharpened mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better in treating small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small unfocussed image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color picture has to be corrected; this picture was done with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to an insufficient light for the Auto-focus liner.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the installation correction of digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The Regler Glätte sets the unsharpness of the spears of the dark, in order to generate a natural pupglasses.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color-tinte allows a adapted color for the Pupglasses. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tool to remove the desired type of artefacts with an unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Indus algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starpoints to simplify the restoration. the options available are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filtering orders, you can use the rider Gleting and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detailing p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of details. a small value leads to a moderate baluity. a value of 0,9 should be sharp. a value of 0,9 should give details so that no sharpening is necessary. please note that the detailed position should always be subordinated to the addiction of dependency.</seg>
<seg id="520">Straeaddiction Alpha [0.100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you create a movie granularity or CCD rouches will generate a high value wave-similar pattern. JPEG artifacts are best done at a value close to 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above alles. p defines the relative smoothness. therefore, put this value appropriate to the level of smoking in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is difficult, since it's difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's turmoil effect it has to be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates as often the algorithm is running. normally, here 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Winkelhoes da [5, 90]: mental lic integration of the anisotropic Alpha. if Alpha has chosen to be small, so that little angle should generate a long term. therefore, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral sounding range [0,1, 10]: integral sounding in pixels. you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid Sub-Pixel-smoothing and never bigger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation use: the Higher quality that you receive by choice of this option is only low. it doubles but the runtime. we recommend it to permit it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons as well as charging make this exactly this. any adjustment of image errors can now be saved into a text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="528">The error correct is comparatively very quick at work. however, it can still be very long and a high CPU load can be drawn. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the knob off.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see like a mistake with small artefacts may be corrected; the module is applied to a photo that is being done in Guatemala City with an analogue camera. as you see there is a peculiar black artefact in the foreground, that caused by a poor filmmaking during the journey is caused by (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digival; smoking-reduction is a very powerful tool to lessen images. it uses an copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool presents selectable image filter to remove stains and other artifacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensations from the camera or moiyman; the effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need further information on sensor bolts from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot picture above shows a typical scene that has been done with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granting noise which can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow advanced settings may remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the amount of filters per pixel and can terminate the image. through the radius opposite the image and color in it is cleared and thus small bugs.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the pixelfepegel. this value puts the pixeleventual changes. if it is raised, smoking filter will restores. if the value is too high, the adaptive filters picture details can no longer be preserved and catching or lubricate.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the appropriate imprecision for the sharpness. this value increases the frequency response of the filter. if it's too strong can not occur the whole rough or smoking points can occur. put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a frail or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the illuminance of the picture. we recommend you to either change color or luminance to change an image. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color-tolerance of the picture. we recommend you to either change color or luminance to change an image. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the Gammatolintolerance of the picture. this value can be used to increase the tolerances of the darker areas, which typically cumbered more strongly. however, it is also contaminated the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Shock absorption: controls the alignment of the phasenjittersteadation. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius is defined as quickly the adaptive filter radius will occur. if it's going to be high, can be a sound and phonemitter at the edges. he can remove debris and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Storing and load: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for smoking-reduction, which you have set can be saved into the filesystem and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how smoking reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and which corrected with (2) marked. the smokreduction has been applied with the standard settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than an image. use this tool for softens with the menu entry Corrigid. click the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digicame; photo Restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to decrease electrartefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">These filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undesirable artefacts of your images. it is very well adapted to remove the gaudy, soundproof, scratching, compartefartefacts, and local errors which occurs in digital, original or subsequently digitised images emerge. the smoothing takes place along the images and thus receives the content as it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texturbine. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas it is not perfect, in some areas, it generates some compression & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards that are in uncompressed picture. this setting is intended to correct those problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons as well as charging make this exactly this. any adjustment of photo restoration can now be saved into a text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo Restoration is comparatively very quick at work. however, it can still be very long and a high CPU load tightening. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the knob break down.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with like-shaped rugs. the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Minolta (tm) HP-5 movie was recorded with a Sensitivity by 3200 ISO. you can see the ringent movies on the faces. the original image is under (1) and that corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo Restoration. this time, textures has been reduced to an old color photo, which has been introduced with a scanner. you can see the scan speciation and the photopapier. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digival; tool hottext permits the text of photos taken with a CCD camera, eight were to remove. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, protected by copyright from Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are particularly high-quality raw-mode photos a problem because many cameras with JPEG compression including an built-in opression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; the Pixelquot; and "quot; bright pixel; on a photo with a dark tube method. there are currently no manual approach to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the assistant with the button dark. the tool becomes automatic to detect the hot and bright pixel. these are highlighted in the preview's preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important to capture the dark picture directly next to the new hot or bright pixel by CCD Defective.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should find the matching darkimage to the correcting picture. take note that the assistant will notice the last dark picture and this automatically recharge this automatically within the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The picture area and the preview can help you to correct the result within the picture. the pre-showcase shows the output of the filter with the current settings. poor pixels are taken up in all the preference areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter to see. then select the best filter method to interpolish these pixel blocks. these are the available filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">During: there is an average of the neighborhoods below. the color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels have drawn a distance of 1 of the pixel block, are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linearen surface (2-DIM) or a group of linear curves (1-DIM). these are then used to interpolish the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block will be withdrawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-DIM) or a group of square curves (1-DIM), which is then used to interpolish the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are pulled to calculate a bi-kubic surface (2-DIM) or a group of cubic curves (1-DIM) that is then used to interpolish the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hottext correction on a color photo, made of a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original picture was increased to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digival; Vignetting-Surgery is a tool to correct the Vignetting, that is, to correct, subset corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Foresters objective, in particular the middle and large photographic format, can frequently illuminate the entire sensor field. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) them reduce the corners and rust of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there. telepathically manifest in circumstances also this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But he also has downsides. many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 with the aperture filter, which is impossible to keep the camera with hand. wide-angle objective should be used, also with Center filter, an opening of f / 16 or smaller as otherwise untougher effects caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the major sipping areas of today's film and color scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a centerpiece by digital cameras and film scanner, the tool is applied with a centerfilter on a picture. the algorithm is copyrighted with a centerfilter on a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controllers you can control the Vignetfrom-filter and with three other exposing the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity setting at the point of the greatest density of the filter. the standard density is 2,0, which is an optical filter with a blending default from 1, or accidentally of a light intensity of 2, desped you reduce the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignation.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leuchstrength, contrast and gamma-settings: the fixing of an image with the Vignetting of the pixels. you have to re-adjust the exposure to the target image with these options. the Regulators provide you only positive values, since you just need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a hostile reigning of the target image, so let the values for illuminate / contrast / gamma with zero and use the Gradation from the & digival; image processing from the menu color Gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting-rektion on a picture. the original image (1) shows the Vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected picture. a luminous and contrast-correction was also carried out in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digival; Linsendistortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses an copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric forcings. colorless distortions can not be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second Grades treated the general geometrical distortion of the lens, and can correct the concave or confine form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third Grades has a similar tour effect, flat, but at edges. this correction is not applied to the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth Grades corrected the remote corners opposite to the second cades. if you combine these two, any geometrical distortion can be virtually eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">Generally speaking, this value determines the strength of the distortion second cades. with negative values, tons-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values are conscientious objections.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth Grades. this value acts more powerful in the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'Corners' parameter has the reversed protector of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value escalating the image size and thus leads to correction first Grades through. negative values increase while maintaining the image smaller.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value stipulates the brightness in the corners of the picture. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values they increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filtering orders, the dialogue with a preview is the distortion connection. the values you use for your image will be stored and used in the next startup as standard values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonnage or disruptly correction should be performed prior to all the fever or size changes. in the best result, you perform this correction as all the first. if you perform an image or perform a tons of tons, the effect would be obvious.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction to assist you to display this tool a vertical and horizontal separating line. move it to an important place, such as the sea front or building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the tonnell- / cooling-shaped distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you want to correct a conscientious objections, the resulting image black corner will have. you can transform it with the feather-tool in the menu transcrop from the image processing or via the zoom Regler to remove this dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most images the tons-shaped correction consists of. the next logical step for some motives, such as shots of the front, frames and paintings, it is the perspective so correct that all angles in the picture 90 degrees. take note of it when you keep the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tons-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method of simulating infrared camera of the Gimpanzu.org web page which is accessible using this URL. the filter reproduces the well known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrarotfilm, see this URL. this film has a Sensitivability of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you can postpone the red right click with the mouse you can see the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can adjust two parameters set filtration and filmsensitivity (ISO). the ISO Regler changes the amount of filtration and dominance of colour green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter colour channels used for reproduce infrared film, especially the green-channel does not make sense the effect on black / white photos, because the colour formations are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of infra-filtered photo on a land photo from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the working picture under (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the ledge.</seg>
<seg id="595">Der & digikam; Filter Filmgritt is a simple to use tool to reproduce movies on your images, such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, known to increase the sensitivity of movies, the manufacturers large silver basins of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film turnout effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. if you want this specific, gallery-like, road-like, granular memory especially in your monochromen photos, so you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the Regler the ISO-sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the Körner. the default value is, although often higher values are needed, adjusted to ISO-2400. if you need even more basins, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film element print on a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and the one worked (2). the used film sensitivity is equal to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digival; Filter oil paintings produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright-protected algorithm from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digival; Filter oil paintings gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting. natural images and style live are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two Regulators found in order to influence this effect. the above, the brush size between one and five out. thicker brush are better suited for large images. smoothes controls the smoothing or, from the other side the hinitfulness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (2) and this is marked with the (2). Pinselsize for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and Glätte 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digival; filter coal drawing is used color and voicing gradient to generate a chargetic in the drawing. therefore, pictures whose gradient are slowly changing and therefore are not ideal for this effect. it's helpful if you choose to sketching the scene you would have chosen to skizze yourself. these would be good pictures to begin with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two lines with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper Regler select the pin size and the lower readjusted the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the label filters. the original image (1) and the edited image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be improved by adapting the intensity's value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digicame; Filter Enengraving your image in 3-D, as if it was stamped in Wax, it uses a copyrighted algorithm from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digival; Filter Engraving is a fast tool to reproduce your images with a 3-D effect. he works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important of the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey, monthdarily landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows the contrast to the filtering. a value of 30, equivalent to 10%, is the default.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the depth used is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of distorative effects. it is used to copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and lets it look, as if it is seen through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave 2: analogue to the wavesome 1, the picture is distorted here in a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can break these effects anytime with the knob break down.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of unsharpable effects. it uses the copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Infinity: blurred the image along fine-shaped lines that originate from a center. this simulates the dissharpness a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often in the sport photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radiale unsharpness: blurred the image by rotating the pixels at a center. this simulates the dissharpness of a revolving camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Removal: blurred the picture to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to come back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement-motion: blurred the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the dissharpness of a linear movements, z: B: from a car or train photographing camera, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softness: blurred the image soft into the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos, or add a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sagarunsharpenny: blurred the image by random shift of the pixels and simulates through this the dissharpness of a random move camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent unsharpness: finds the color-basins in the picture and widen it without the rest to change.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it through the colt with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the knob break.</seg>
<seg id="624">The rain drops are a nice little tool to make rain drops in your image. thus, it gives natural your images a nice appearance. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn reindeted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the trop. as the trouser size does not occur automatically with the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce size for small images. number changes the number and the density of drops. fish pressure changes the optic effect of the drop in the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use with the & digival; picture editing a range from Regentropfen. use the selection tool to set the area, for example a face, which should remain free. if you start the filter off, the area will remain free of rain drops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the bookcase filter. the original image (1) shows a peaceful sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the standard values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">When the photo has the wrong orientation, you can get it by mirror or turning into the right orientation. the tools can be transfigured in the menu and transform them into the menu.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflatable is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a picture in a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to enlarge is simple. the big question is how can you find an image bubble and the details are sharp? how can you find the missing information again? how can you find the missing information again? how can you find the missing information again? how can you see the missing information here? try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can change it on the desired size with the tool size. choose to change size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool to change size uses a linear interpolationmethod to enlarge the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool for inflatable.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many educational programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. Spline interpolation to enlarge a picture. and used a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflatable photo was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg Project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool like you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">One aspect ratio is kept: if this setting is activated, the entry of the new size is maintained to the original ratio of its original image.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects bigger structures. the higher the value is set, the more it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's turmoil effect it has to be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons, as well as charging can be used exactly in the same way. any plug-in for photo can be saved as a text file, and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflatable is very quick in what it makes, but it can still last very long and draw a high CPU load safely. you can break the calculation at any time with the knob break down.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo inflatable by adding a small color picture to double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the Preview (2) is the result of linear standard Augmentation on the comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not only a commonly performed surgery, but also a commonly underestimated tool to compile an image. in order to create a picture with mouse, by pressing the mouse button and drag the rectangle, create. you will then see this right after you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you run the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut down. this will give you a good overview of your photo after the cutting area. you can drag the size of the cutting area by drag on the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle create you by simply drag it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting-section, use the button "Accrude button of picture processing in the toolbar and the photo is customizable (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file storing or file storing under the menu file to save the newly built photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the forefield, you can change the size of the rectangle by move the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio which you have defined in dialogue will be retained.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After sideways, you can specify the orientation as a high format or cross-format. in the high format is always the greater value of height and in the cross-format of the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool After sideways is using a relative page ratio. this means that it's always the same, regardless of whether you are using inches, inch or any other physical size. you can see e.g. below a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and their side-ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialogue, there are two buttons for the selection automatically horizontal or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in dialogue you can set up with the Max. relation to the area to the cutting on the greatest possible, depending on the chosen relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool After sides ratio stores its settings depending on the orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you are using the cutting tool, these settings will be stored as default values depending on the orientation. the modified images are reflected in the EXIF tables, so the EXIF data are reflected to the cropped image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the composition aid allow assistance to be involved, so that you can better compose your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-thirds, harmonic triangles are a possibility of sharing a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles on the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a division that is on different natural growth pattern, such as the spiral of a Nautilus pussy, or the blacks of a sunflower. it emerges in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrationale number of 1,6988... and it was already used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks, so that their temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your images, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci as a result of 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. at the present divider is 1: 1,618 the golden middle. a composition that is usually follows as visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden centre represents liquid aid-lines available when you put an image. these aids are recorded below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirale will bring you closer to your goal for your photos. compared to the third party, the Golden Spirale produces a liquid line of the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the eye of the spectator along the line of the spiral and creates a balanced visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangle of golden spiral, also called golden frame. it should give something that the eye at the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects. this something can simply be there without the eye, it will fulfil its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles also lead from the above mentioned golden bowls. take note of this, which in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are no equalizzling triangles. diagonal to these lines can be placed a static object dynamically appeared.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles in order to break your frame, create an effect of using professional photo graphs dynamic Symmetry. try your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information into the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach any other way.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal and Vertical can be used to reflect the harmonic particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the knob, you can set the colour of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the help lines can be invisible. this way you can adjust the color of the lines of your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to turn a picture to any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, it happens easily that you are not exactly vertically or horizontal. this produces a picture where things came around a angle. you can repair this with the & digival; picture processing and the tool free rotation. choose to transform it free and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slider are stated in degrees. with the knobs you can put the slider on the right side of the window. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right top.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help the module Free Rotation provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse-cursor to position the two lines. after you move it over an important point of the picture, you can set it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now you adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you shot an image, you will find unwanted holes in the corners. a way to fix it is the function transformate to use from picture editing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the automatic cutting. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option anti-aliasing the image a bit after the rotation. however, take note of the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed to a fixture on the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your picture. the preview is then automatically calculated. on the right of the dialogue, you will find some information which help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas that are created through the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas that are created through the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle on the top left: shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle on the top: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adapting the perspective the picture becomes a bit dirty. for a single adaptation this effect is small, but two adjustments create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you adapted the perspective you get unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way of bersome it is the picture to transform it from the image editing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool-tool is used to postpone part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite. this is not a rotation, the image is distorted. with other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can transform this module via transforming shear.</seg>
<seg id="679">Configure your image by using the horizon and vertical angle. you can press horizontal and vertically at the same time. if you press on preference, the angle will be displayed at zero. a preview of the effect is displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the showroom.</seg>
<seg id="680">At your help is a vertical and a horizontal line appears. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the pattern hair to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you carried out the shear, the picture gets a bit blurred. for a single switching, this effect is generally negligible, but two lockers might become twice as much swiss and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After cheating, the image has an unbeautiful triangular holes in the corners. a way to remove it is the picture to transform it from the image editing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digifted; you need a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries complies. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digiate;</seg>

<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import your in raw format stored pictures in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command lines by Dave Coffin. a original quotation from Him is: expect from dcraw not that it creates the same results as the software from your camera body. sometimes you get better results with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the raw file that is to be converted and start the module. the Raw-Bildconverted window appears in the mode for a single image. with the button preview you can preview the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option will decide whether the camera settings can be used for the white pin. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / Blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG Conversion can be selected to allow you to use contracted information. if your camera is working in RGB mode the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion results. the filename remains the same and just the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG used a verbal algorithm and produces for the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, maintains all the information of your image and uses the lossy LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">In case you prefer to edit your images frequently or you later prefer to use later on, you should not choose the JPEG format as there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to retain the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as storage format, the metadata present in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the file-if information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings you can start with the execute button, start the conversion. if you want to break this process then you can use it.</seg>
<seg id="863">The forklift workload allows you to convert multiple images to one time. use this mode therefore if you're safe, e.g. by testing to a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The options available are almost identical with the version for individual images. however, you have the option to automatically resign the existing file. however, this is not available. however, a preview is not available. the progress shows how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following picture formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used for renaming all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the start number and timestamps which should be used.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a image collection. it used to enlarge the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can enlarge the image size:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is automatically selected, depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option e.g. to customize your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportionate size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed by this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing preparation: prepare the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge-size and background colour, is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your favorite e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the required pictures beforehand. further pictures can be taken on the list of the images below.</seg>
<seg id="873">After which you have started the module will pop up the image window with the images you select. over the button images can add you with a file-selection dialog to add additional pictures. for the last one chosen picture the preview is displayed on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the picture list and drop it down to add the list of images below.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the knob pictures you will remove the selected images from the list of the images below.</seg>
<seg id="876">Once you have selected all the images you can click with the button OK the new message window of your e-mail client. you only have to add the addresses and the subject area. the pictures selected are attached to you as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Don't pay attention to many images at once. most email accounts have limitations for the size of the e-mails. it may be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window will be used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is stored and once again used until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you need to install the Gmailbox on your computer before. you can download this here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the selection of comments in a attached file you will add comments to the pictures into a text file and the mail attached.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu file file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photographic files such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality will not be changed. otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG under photos file format and the original files in the JPEG format are, then the original Exifs are added to the detailed pictures.</seg>
<seg id="884">If the process is finished, the window will not automatically closed down the status of status, in search of errors. however, your e-mail program will be automatically started at the end. with the button closing, you can read this window? en.</seg>
<seg id="885">After launching the module Fortgeschrittene Diaschau appears a window with questions like you want to have your slideshow. you can choose between the album selected and all the photographs of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The API OpenGL transitions in the presentation are activated very elegant image transitions via OpenGL. you do not have to possess an appropriate graphics card since otherwise the slideshow is very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The filenames option ensures that the filename of the pictures are displayed in the left lower corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an end loop. you can then switch it manually with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images by chance select is that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not used in order of the pictures in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Under delay between the images the temporary distance between the individual images can be set. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. so you should test it before you presentation your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There is more than a dozen transition effects that you can choose. accidentally, choosing a different effect in any transition between the images.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the Diaschau you can access a toolbar at the top left side of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to switch it off.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can keep the presentation and start again, jump to the previous one and the next picture and stop the diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left of the screen, you can see the current date stream, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date readjustly currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-Imaging @ kde.org. Resellers: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module wallpaper is a tool to set an image as a background image for the working space.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module requires the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as a background for your KDE-working space.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have equipped your images and videos with editorial notes, you can see with & kphotographer, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the image, are now available in any group, so in persons, places and in group keywords entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you see the categories that you have provided information as you have provided your pictures and videos featuring comments. additionally, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current previewer. in the following each one is described for himself.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser is changing. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the images are displayed on which both people are visible. through this selection method, you can restrict the number of images seen from a few thousand images to some single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the people, places and other settings, you can view the photo images to look at the images of your business.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can store with & kphotoalbum; however, for each person you can store your own image, This also applies to places, keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself. see the image.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images beside the names, select the button which view right outside on the toolbar. please note that you can view the view for each category separately. this has the advantage that you can display e.g. symbols with pictures of people and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have any suitable pictures for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must choose which image should be displayed for each individual person. in order to display this, you need to display the image slideshow window (in nearer described) and select the image for the appropriate person. in the pop-window you can adjust the magnifier factor according to your needs and thus choose which part of the picture is displayed or be cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you open the entry to the entry in the main window, you will see a dialog, which is very similar to the dialog for fixing the image properties. this dialog allows you to look at the picture once again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a strings in the field log or description, the signments and descriptions of images are searched for this text; i.e. the date can be either part of the total date, i.e. for example, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as in 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can browse all images by certain names, as you can see in the picture. here, according to pictures, on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are shown.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you do not like to read handbooks, instead you prefer to try the functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and have a look at the quick entry to the screen photos and the latest videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Launch & kphotoalbum; and select in the first dialog the demo, if you started & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu item using the menu tool. then some example will be loaded and you can try the functions of & knualbum; try.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a cohesive HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & knualbum; take a look at the timeline. a picture of this glue you can see here:. as the name suggests, this glue shows you data statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can show you several different timeline. each glue then displays a different unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. in the picture you see a portion of a database by showing the corbust only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline you can use in the following ways: you can preview the displayed entries file from the database (if you select a date, the first image of this date displayed in the preview feature) and also displays the timeline always the current date from the moment shown, if you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of timeline by pressing the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the timeline. if you select a range, you'll be able to abort the choice only images of this period. you can abort the selection by clicking on a beam of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; introduces you two options to create HTML websites with your images. the one is integrated into & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other as module available (see). in the following part of the user's manual, the integrated version is described above, you can create HTML on the menu file...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and destination. in the following, each section is described more exactly.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title's title and a description which should contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML-example pages you'll see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & kphotoalbum; -export file will be created to see the overview page. approximate information about the export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages. therefore, you can avoid that information is displayed in the viewer. for example, that all pictures are from a party. remember that & kphotoalbum; at the moment all pictures exported. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain considerations.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages will look like. most settings are clear, which is why not specifically received.</seg>
<seg id="923">Below you can adjust different solutions to the pictures. by this, those who have to look at your website and have a monitor which support maximum resolution 800x600, no images download, for example, you have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer on your page can change the resolution at any time you have fixed. so, it can search your images with lower resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time, then if he wants to get a picture larger then he moves to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setup area, set the different folder and URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best to select for all your HTML files a base folder and for each subsequent sentence a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the root folder in which all your images are stored. this folder is stored and automatically transfered to the next time. here you can choose either a folder or a KDE Support protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your images, you can check if this really is all visible for viewers. if you have created a web browser, after the pages have been created, this folder should be. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the files created by you do not have to copy them in the final destination folder, you must manually copy it. so that the import function, see, right works you will need to specify the final target of the files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are in.</seg>
<seg id="930">The options described below have set out all three to basic folders or URLs. this is created a subfolder, whose name will define you in the issuing folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">In case you are on a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; come together, you might want to have a HTML page for viewing the images. if you have already eaten a lot of time for viewing the images, reception, etc. to write, then you have to do with & knualbum; this work will not even be done.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum, you can export a copy of your pictures into a .kim file. you can import other files into your database. the image features will be imported and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images are stored in the file or whether the file is stored in the file. the advantage is that you have all images together and that you can share it independently. the obvious disadvantage is however the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can export a .kim file either directly from the menu file... or together with HTML pages, see if you create a .kim file along with a HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file looks for the pictures in a fold way. first, the pictures are not found in the folder of the .kim file. the corresponding pictures are not found, so the pictures of the URL, which you created when creating the HTML files. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML-Export.</seg>
<seg id="936">"" "in the following, dialogue for export of images is described, which you can export over the menu file..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialogue is whether it is to be internal or external .kim files. it will provide you with the following three choices:</seg>
<seg id="938">When selecting manuell in the vicinity of the .kim file, you must copy the images into the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option automatic to copy the .kim file, copy & knualbum; the pictures automatically copy for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most images have been compressed with JPEG compressed and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth the files to compress. if you wish to, just choose the option export file compressed.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is limit maximum image size. if you want to send your friends images, the .kim file might not be very big. here you can limit the size by saying that each picture is at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">When you select a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file, you will select & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to impose consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then, in which folder the import images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you are the category individuals who are named in importing the file (if you are a Dane), while this category is called for your database. therefore, you will be imported into the third dialog windows, which categories which are imported to imported file and which categories that suit your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can import the categories of import into the categories of your current database. an example for this can be seen on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse images and look at: if you see pictures, one often wants to look at pictures of your Italy holiday & mash; if you want to discover pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures of which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will find the various steps from (1) capture the information about your images, about (2) the flow and view, up to (3) advanced themes and adaptations.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum was taken as a program for reviewing your images. but it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but frequently it also closes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& knualbum, stores all of its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of their images. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy disk or revisions of the CVS, where they would like to.</seg>
<seg id="950">& knualbum, remember the folder in which your images are stored and used this at future starter. if you want to start a different folder tree with images, you can start & kphotographer album; with the option -c. as an example: knualbum -c ~ / company / Images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Over the menu entry settings, set up; assemble to a window where you can change the settings of & karialbum; in the following section of the user's manual, you will explain the different settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the left you see six different symbols, with which you can access settings and options for the viewers. for each setting there is a detailed help available, you can call on the F1 button and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">In this case, you describe how you can specify different properties, such as people, places and tags. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialog, which is used to already edit existing groups. for each existing group you can select a marking and selecting a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories already mentioned. in dialogue options, you can set complete members groups, i.e., for example, all members of a group will count on once in a group rather than in a group of members as described in a group.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view the settings that are available to you for fixing the member groups. with the above-listed listing list, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left window lists, a list with the current category and on the right is a list of categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares its module system with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module is called KIPI and means & kde; image Plugin interface. nails information can be found on the home page of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called on the menu modules. the modules can and will not be described in this manual as they are not part of & kphotoalbum; are, but are distributed separately. however, most modules have a help page that you can call on the modules themselves.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules can be used together by several applications each other, it can be that the modules with & kphotoalbum; therefore, you should try new modules first with the demo database. therefore, you should either call up the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu help. say not, I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules via KIPI are very different, whereby it can be that some modules with & kphotoalbum; not function. this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications can't use their pictures into albums: this type of order is not supported, simulates it for some modules the order after albums, so that you can use the functions with & kphotographer album.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulated & kphotoalbum; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view, so all the pictures that show you the picture shows at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the latest album must be recorded & knualbum; the modules also still pass a list of albums. here, & kissed album; how follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">When & kphotoalbum; s browser displays the content of a category, for example, all persons, then each entry of this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will set the category which you have set in the setup dialog as a category for virtual albums. for example, if you are using the category people, it will be chosen as if you would have chosen people to view and pass this module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum; not compatible can you remove them from the list of modules. start the setup dialog and select in the area modules, which modules will be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a screen screen, once you set & knualbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are familiar with it from any other KDE application, you can see the window with which you can browse your image database. at the moment, it does not contain a lot of information about your images. in the section we will come back to this window, but then click the listing which shows you an overview with all available images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to see each picture with editorial notes. this includes information about the persons listed on the picture, where the image has been recorded either individually or for a larger number of images provided specific remarks at the same time. if for example on all pictures Issuperseded and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for seeking and browsing as you can read in section. if you like, you can see these notes if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view three lists with a text field by choosing people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; since you will always use it again if you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to relocating the images within the list: if you have for example a family party and are shown at all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons, so you can find that the names used to be moved up, the people can find faster and arrange.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to receive an alphabetically modified list, click on the icon for Sorteren by date below the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected any remarks on each picture individually, you may like to edit all the selected images and provide these pictures with editorial notes. simply click on the above and back-buttons, which are under the preview of the picture right above.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more comfortable to mark all these images and to use the menu item multiple entries on once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. besides, San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as an overgroup. to show you that it is an overgroup, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context-menu of the quildialogs it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over- or subcategory. in addition, you can also drag an entry to a category and drop it to a subcategory of this item. respect, this requires that you are just using your categories alphabetically. see this.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can postpone the individual elements of the caderdialogs which form the top-edge of the frame, click and move. you can also make a private window by selecting it outside the window.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the look of the window to your needs, that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the button options... that offers you the option to store the current layout and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also let a frame completely blends. if you want to see this window later, use the button options... and then window will be a / off. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in the browser you'll get an overview with preliminary images of the currently selected images, or any pictures if you do not have a filter. you can configure the size of the curtains, by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button, configure. try it simple.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set as a backpicture for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, it is displayed in the image center. if you don't have a window opened with a picture display, a new ad view is created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the preview feature. simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press the Edit button. now, you will see the window displayed in the picture you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotographer album; you can also use a solution for this problem. you can also use the images on your hard disk. of course you have to record the images anywhere, so that you can record the images anywhere; in the picture you see the view from & kphotoalbum; if not all necessary images can be loaded from your hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images where the right obscary corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard disk. however, for the images 5-9, however, the predictions exist, so that's images can show you. however, you can't view these pictures with the image center.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you don't need this function to copy files from the folders and then copy them again. & knualbum; therefore, it does not support you to avoid the recording of the concerned CD. if you want to avoid any hassle, how to avoid moving one-edge of your images, please buy a larger disk in order to save all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu images you will find a submenu with the name of privacy. if you want to stay a little bit more privacy, you would like to impose any more privacy in the menu. alternatively, you can also click all the pictures that may see your little sister, conteuve and choose the menu entry all besides current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">Therewith you have fixed what pictures in the fall of the case will be hidden. if you want to block the laptop with your little sister, allowing all the images you have locked in. if you want to see the pictures again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password that needs to be inserted to the unlock of the pictures. to set this password, simply select password in the menu privacy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this picture guard is by no means very safe. for example, you can access the file index.xml, the password as unencrypted text or delete. this type of password protection applies only to those who are with & kphotoalbum; not very familiar to the view of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you want to spend all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; of course you manage them at some time. for this reason you want to see them sometime. for this reason, it has a picture _ and video medal. you can preview this from the preview, as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. he naturally shows the image, but additional all the information you enter into the picture, e.g. who is on the image, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the Infobox on the upper part of the picture you want to see it, you can also drag them with your mouse and get somewhere else. you can also configure what information is displayed and whether all these options are available according to a right click on the viewers.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click here, see the matching entries on this page. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you were selected from the browser and then Anne Helene would have chosen.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them back and back by using the keys picture high and image. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and end. these features are also accessible from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run it as diaschau. & knualbum; then it invites a new image after a few seconds. how often it can load a new image by pressing the Strg button and Plus or minus. started and stopped running the diaschau by the buttons Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of beholder of & kphotoalbum; it is to be changed in full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer use the complete place on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to the full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the spectator you can use the image and draw out zooming. with the mouse button you can simply drag a rectangle. with the minus button you can come back rauszooming The Plus Taste zoomt in the middle of the picture shows how a zoom-rectangle is highlighted and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button you can reset your zoom so that the picture is not shown zoomed. with the equation, the zooms uses the zooms, so that each pixel corresponds to the screen of a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomoperations are working with videos that are in and out and zooming with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the rotation functions from the context menu, you can turn the image. this does not work with videos. you can make notes to the current picture with the menu item remarks from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you can look at pictures it may happen to put an image with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture. at the moment you can preview the image and configurations dialog by the picture to insert this name. however, you will perhaps prefer to mark the image and consider additional pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures on paper. to see which photos you want to start the viewer with the images and watch them as good or bad, while watching one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above there is the spectator the possibility to provide pictures with characteristics while you are viewing. characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can press a characteristic that you press the corresponding letter. in look at a picture where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set on your images, these are available to you in the browser. so you can see them in the browser. therefore, you can use all the images you want. this is described in. after that, you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the viewing view. if you can browse categories in Dre Vorviewview, then you can press features to the pictures once the image was selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on an image. for this case allows you & karialbum; to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The painted is not saved with the image, but in the database. in the way you can do your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In the picture you can see a picture in the painted picture. to switch the Malmodus of & kphotoalbum; to turn off the painting paint from the context menu. to end the Malen, simply put the cross at the toolbar top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you have to rule the application of the program & Povray; not completely dominate, but the documentation to & Povray; should you necessarily have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and displays the object in the wiremodel views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects simultaneously. but not the object of an already selected object, since all subobject are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position in which you want to insert the object and click on the icon at the toolbar or select a menu item in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">There are several possible positions, the following popups will be built, so that you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">By deleting either from the menu bar under beg or from the context menu of right mouse button, you can then remove selected objects from the scene before.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have altered attributes, click to apply to these changes. do you have invalid values displayed. then you can correct the input data correct and then click on or put the changes with effluence.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to the & Povray; user documentary in the Easy dialog, you can call the & Povray; -reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this property. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 contains already the user's documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can preview a preview in the original view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the original view and a small example of the scene will be posted with the chosen texture. as preference, the entire texture will be selected (for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), cross it locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the checkpoints of the camera. you can drag these checkpoints with the mouse and thereby change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen, the checkpoints disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire view. this cross marks the centre for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift through pulling with the mouse inside the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has an imagining level of visibility. you can indicate this value relative to the visibility of an orderly object or as absolute value. objects will only appear when they are selected or their visibility is smaller, or equal to the toolbar of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window display as preference. the object tree and display of the object features are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window-order, or if you need a different type of arrangement, you can store them as desired. you can also store multiple window buttons and easily switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window or under a present view, drag the beginner to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle shows then the new position on.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the beginner to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends to the overall height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to rearrange several views over each other, drag the beginner in the middle of another view. you can then switch between the views through clicking on the cardboard box top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window-order are swapping views: beliefs that are not enshrined in the main window. to resolve a view from the anchoring, drag the beginner onto the desktop or click on the small to the left above Forgiving arrow in the trial.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the early bar. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between arrow and cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the menu view you will find entries for any type of views. new views are slimming, you can anchor it in any more popular place.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window display can save you with window-order... save it. it will display a dialog in which you can save the window of window under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you created a scene, you can rendering them. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; this program has to be correctly installed. as this manual has been written, was & Povray; 3.5. this version is supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To rendering the current scene, click on the icon renders from the toolbar or select the menu item scene rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it controls the image size and the quality of the rendering. if you want to insert a scene in various sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many Render Modi, from a quick preview of up to full-quality graphics.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the icon The Render settings in the toolbar list or select Render Modi menu, the following dialogue will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can input any name, usefully, but a name that lets the properties of the mode can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map map size you can set the width and height of the frame image. if you want only to rendering a small area of the image, select the cross section scabrupt section and enter the image section for rendering into the input field.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the Coming field quality you can select the properties that uses & Povray; to the rendering time. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex non-diffuser Reflection. a detailed description of the Render properties can be found in the user manual and Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If an image is issued with just a beam per pixel, there can be different mistakes. these images often have a Moirè pattern or spill effects in curves and lines, besides sometimes details are not displayed, if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally, pictures with this feature look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you switch to anti-aliasing, switches and connects & Povray; more than a beam of pixels. this technique means super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as a standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling the adjacent Pixels with one. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively, because every pixel is constantly further split and adaptive as the record-based color values depend.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray adds a beam up to the neighboring pixels with super-sampling kits, then both pixels are charged with the pursuit of a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you calculate the deep-value at 4, a grid of 4x4 will be charged with a low-value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams each pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels will be calculated: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the pre-given threshold, the pixels will be divided into 4 subpixel that will be tracked individually and tested for further submissions. the maximum depth of the record can be set with the lowest value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another opportunity to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of smokers for the ray process, called Jittering. if you turn right, & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of the renderns is diffuse reflexion. this is an experimental property of & Povray; it is an experimental property of & Povray; it takes very long to calculate one scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map map you can set whether the Alpha channels will be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel will then be transparent if the associated rays have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window to display the & Povray; -Consolencore. when & Povray; unexpectedly, you can find the reason for this here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; -scene to import, select the menu entry to Imports... and select a file in dialogue window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not the complete command haul of & Povray;. if when beating error messages or warnings appear, a dialog window shows a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source text of the object to import text file in the editor. to import objects in the scene, simply mark the source text in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and pasting in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray; also in.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called if & kpovmodeler; one scene renders. usually this is Povray or x-Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on help in the original view, it opens & kpovmodeler; the indicated object. place the path to your document tention and version. if you have supported the version 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example on track record) in the paths to the & Povray; -libraries. if you include files not in the folder of the scene, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The colour for the wire models. the second color is used for viewing the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The colour for checkpoints. the second color is used for viewing the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The colour of the rectangle for the Visfield in the camera view and in the window-type characteristic.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch up of the points on the grid menu in the context menu of the wilight model. you can adjust here the grid for shifting, scannations and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a precision wipe model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time to rendering. for some objects like the ball you can adjust the detailed stage for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross the High Detailed view for extended projections, all the wire views are further dividing if the camera is using an advanced projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical projections. this property gives better approach to projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross the wall you cross a wall behind the objects, a wall is displayed behind the objects. the wall is displayed in a chess column, consisting of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">If you show ground to the bottom, a soil is hidden below the objects. the soil is displayed in a chess column, consisting of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you can activate Kantenglättung, the non-recursive antialiasing method used for the rendering of scenes. the values for depth and swelling can be set. more precise information about the parameters can be found in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can modify existing window regulations or create new window regulations. in the section window regulations is explained, how you can create window-regulations and save.</seg>
<seg id="1072">Das Kombinationsfeld Standard-Vent-ordnung: displays all existing window buttons. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of the current datandas illustrates all existing windows. a new order can create you with the button below and delete a selected arrangement with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window of window is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name shows all the views for the selected window order. new views can create you with the button Add and delete selected views with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column you create a new column on the right side of the existing windows, with uncapping the window under the existing window, with map view, you will see a cardboard box together with the previous view and swaying view not in the main window but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just arrived & Povray; and now you want to start with no more detailed knowledge of the two programs. if you follow any steps in this tutorial, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, amongst others very popular: a bullet on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings, before you complain that you as a result will only get a black screen. if you use a 3D program for firing, you should notice these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules may be applied to rendering as a result you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't fit a light sources, your entire scene is in the dark and you only get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have everything error-free, take a look at the first start of & kpovmodeler: the following convolts window:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the toolbar. read the documentation, so that you can get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodular; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. highlight the scene and then select the menu item editing. that's why you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene which you generate. in particular, you notice the in the fourth wire view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the result of the renderns of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you can see the content of the view object properties, where the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user's guide to & Povray; you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change anything to the basic settings of the camera, this is later reserved to instructions, but note that the camera in the view checkpoints will change. just click with the left mouse button on a conload point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you use the knob or press the input paste, the wire model views and the object tree immediately change these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you could insert a quotation (inserting body jader) and size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but that's an understanding method for solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides a simpler option. you can use an infinite level as a floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the plain in the object tree, change the name and then press the button. in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire-model view also shows the plane, even if at the moment it rendering only a limited plane. if you rendering the scene, the plane stretched up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you can examine the object tree exactly, you will notice that you can choose the entry for the floor. in this case, you will see the different parameters of the object. in this case, you will see the different parameters of the object. in this case, you will find the different parameters for each new object: scaling, rotation, and shift. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the ground to exercise a unit under the horizon, only to get you acquainted with some of these parameters. select shifting and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Just choose the ground up to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog, where you can select how the object is to be inserted. please select the object tree. the pigment will then change in the object tree (name = floor pigment), with one click on the button preview, see how the pigment looks like now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment only shows a Matte box material because you can still enter settings for the pigment. therefore, you'll always remember the colors for pigment at any time with a click on preview. also, there are many possibilities, but you are now taking the simplest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you do not preview any color on quasicubes and ball, click on the button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now right now. if you hit your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following results:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course this is not the Farben. you are expected to enter two new attributes. in the Farbenlist you need to enter two new attributes. then select this entry twice (you can also do this more frequently, but the chess board list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Select the object tree every time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step you should simply be able to execute simply because you should have understood the fundamental working method of & kpovmodeler; the bullet can be just as simple as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings. Set the value for radius: on 1 (do not forget the cover paste or the knob to squeeze) so the ball has float above the ground, since you have postponed the ground for a unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering yields now a strange result: as previously seen before, the ball appears like a Mattel black material. Set in the following step with suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you chose the ball, you can assign your material now. as is the ground, let the ball give a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select the object and change the name for example in the sphere of pigment. click on the ball pigment, then select one color and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can get more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on or press the input paste.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The attitudes shine-effect and reflection already result in partial visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal: still not selected at all:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you have & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you switch to a scene raytracer, the renderer goes hypothetical rays from the perspective of the beholder (d. h. from the camera that identifies the scenes) through each pixel in the scene and how atmospheric effects of light sources in the scene and like atmospheric effects such as fog. thus, the scene will be processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see nothing without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you see the scene. without a light source you also see nothing, the image is simple. obviously any scene, which is to be rolled, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog, you can select a file you have previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be added to this submenu and replace the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it is stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Imagine the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage will be discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">You can only select this menu if you do not have stored changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeatedly, the last reverted command. this menu entry can only select if you have used defences.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window of window and opens up a dialog, where you enter a name for a new order or write an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting up & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the keyboard, and the basic behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog for change the keyboard shortcut. you can edit or add new commands with this option. you may change or add new commands with this option.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbar. you can add and remove the toolbar for & kpovmodeler: commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A platformer map is a way to pull-up surfaces without having to model any bump on the surface individually modelling and without changing the geometrical form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file both for a bump-map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Landlords are simple geometrical forms that can use as a building blocks: very complex 3D models are generated from dozens of thousands or even hundreds of this basic body. these models will then be processed in order to give them a realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object to pixel base, by using a image file as a colour card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow, is a comfortable screen view and navigator. the application has a file browser in which you can choose pictures to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can either be displayed in an own window in the size of the picture or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow, is very simple. the file browser lists files you can go with Click & LMBn; or the button return.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions which are mostly also found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browsers, player, playlist, playlists and scripts. an example call for the DCOP function or example; look like:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the commandline options of Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok has some own commandline options.</seg>

<seg id="1187">In the folder scripts / load you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts, or simply expand it to expand the required functions. you will quickly determine that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP you can replace your scripts with Amarook and Amarook. the easiest way is using the command's command dcop; which every KDE installation should include.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripts allow the execution of external programs and commands. in this way the function exec () is used. this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively simply. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarook; sends a notifications to all running scripts. this is why scripts, will continuously monitor their standard input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script should ignore the events even if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure indicates the script to display the Easy dialog. to store the storing and loading of the setup data, each script needs to be run. if a script is started, Amarook sets the workfolders on the folder, where all data should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signalizes that a new piece is played. the script could now be & eg; with DCOP functions further information on the new piece (for example the metadata or trickles).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newvolume signaled a change in volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Customizing Clicked: submenu itemTitle, contains the path to select the selected files from playlist, if a user-defined menu item can use the DCOP-function dcop Amaroscript (submenu itemTitle). to remove an entry again you dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amaroe stops, or when the user stops a script, send & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed, such as the storing of data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amarine script management can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar-Archive (.tar), which can also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2). we recommend a archive name such as e.gi.amarokscript.bz2, so that the user can clearly recognise the archive as Amarook script.</seg>

<seg id="1334">In this chapter we explain how all the functions of & Amarok will be used, including creating a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your One-click & Amarok; control centre. on the top of the window is a running text display, which indicates the current track or current stream. directly below is the area, the game time, bitrate and samplerates of the current piece again. a click on this area changes the display of the time already stopped game time of the piece.</seg>

<seg id="1338">Under the run text, the buttons are also PL and EQ. the button PL is enabled or disables the playlists window, while the button EQ is used for setting Equalizer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player's window is made up of the playlist, the volume control and the piece-positions sliders. use the sliders to adjust the piece position or volume. with the playback buttons, you can stop the playback and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The use of the built-in Equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from Classical to Techno, and you can easily create own presets.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To display the Equalizer you use extras Equalizer from the main menu or click the button EQ in the Player window. once you mark the cross-lane Equalizer, the Equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist of & Amarok; is the playlist developed playlist of all for & kde; available multimedia player. she has many features that are there in no other player. however, you can not scare of the abundance of functions, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlists window can be divided into two main areas, on the left side is the navigation field. in the navigation area, you can find some of the excellent functions of the playlist, such as the context browser. on the right, the playlist is easy to use and yet even advanced users is powerful enough.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context-browser displays various information about each of the current piece. its appearance can be adapted with the help of context-browser design. the context-browser contains three subwindows: music, text and performer. these three subwindows will be explained later in detail. they provide information on the ongoing basis in each of the different aspects.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok; perhaps you might find that the subwindow starts off. the information presented is now in other parts of & Amarok; moreover, the information can be collected in the statistics window (Extras Statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The subwindow music shows information about the current piece, as well as the interpreter and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this sub-window shows information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, interpreters and the album. below you can see the album image of the album and next to a MusicBrainz icon. click on this symbol to emplate the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Under the MusicBrainz icon you will find more information about the current piece. you can see here, how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time, and its assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To view cover images in context-browser, the Cover images are supported in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats are supported, but images can be viewed with the word front in the name. the context-browser also displays cover images which were either downloaded with the Cover Administration or are embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next area, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces on. if you click on one of these pieces, it will immediately be played.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended gaps are the favorite pieces of this interpreters. this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information can be displayed in the music window - click on the right button anywhere in the window and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last area, albums of the performer, lists all albums of the current interpreters you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will be picked up and you'll see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all pieces in the different areas to start playing with the playback. you can also click on the right click and then select from the context menu one of the ways to add the piece or album to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the subwindow text the downloaded text is displayed for the current piece. this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download the text window by yourself. if you click on the text subwindow, try to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if still no text script runs, you can choose which to be started.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The knob editing allows you to edit the lyrics. the altered version is then stored in & Amarok; s collection database. this is not a run text script necessary.</seg>

<seg id="1359">Group Interpret / Album - First pages will be arranged according to Interpret and below will see another division after the respective album. if you want to see connections or soundtrack albums, this is the best view on your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list below Miscellaneous Interpreten.</seg>

<seg id="1362">Grouping genre / Interpret - your pieces are first displayed in the genre and under it following interpret.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Group genre / Interpret / Album - This setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the performer.</seg>

<seg id="1365">With the last knob you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will your collection automatically capture, once you own something on the selected folders. if you own many pieces, this could take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">Directly under the toolbar is a search filter. it is reflected in the list view as well as in the construction view. notes to the use of this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter, there is a selection field with which help you can filter out the most recently added pieces to your collection, starting from the last 24 hours to a year. besides, you can also select your total collection, which enables the filter to be switched practically.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking on an entry in the collection-browser you will receive the following possibilities.</seg>

<seg id="1379">The playable browser design is easy to deal with many playlists. among other things, it also contains Intelligent playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlists-Browsers contains the smart playlists. these use & Amaros; s built-in database to automatically create some useful renditions for running time. the intelligent playlists are made up of:</seg>

<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar there is a search area, with which you can search for a file. the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all the files will be hidden, which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser, you can get an adress bar with which you can pick music from a given URL. if you are using music from a single URL / musik.tar.gz and you can access music in the file musik.tar.gz. now you can drag the music from there to playlist and drop.</seg>

<seg id="1390">If you choose to enter between the search terms, the items will contain either one or the other search term. example: one OR two OR three. in this example all pieces will be found that one or two or three (or a combination of it).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries to contain spaces, then close the search term with geese: Mike Oldfield. thus, according to lectures, Mike Oldfield will be found, but not following entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a certain search column, you can also search for larger or smaller. for example: review: &gt; 50. This is looking for gaps, which have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a certain search term, make a minus sign in front of the search term: -something looks for gaps, which don't contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntaxis for rent with one another. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 - comment: bad. this searches for all pieces that contain either Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating as 50 and not contain the comment.</seg>

<seg id="1459">Closes the current project. if a project has changed and not stored, ask K3b; according to what should be done. you can then switch between storing and changes. also, you can also break the closing and keep the project so open.</seg>
<seg id="1460">Closes all open projects. & K3b; will ask for each not stored project, what should happen to happen, just as if you were called for each project file.</seg>
<seg id="1461">Closes all open projects and ends & K3b;. for each not stored project will be consulted, what should happen to happen, as if you had called the file.</seg>
<seg id="1462">If you open this entry, you can select the desired dialog files to add to the project. this has the same effect as if you enter the files directly from the top view into the project in view. if the current project is a data CD, the added files appear in the base folder of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Opens the dialog "burning" for the current project. this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project. the only difference is the additional button burning, the & K3b; to burning the medium. the burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data.</seg>
<seg id="1464">Opens the Properties dialog for the current project. here you can make a lot of project-related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of which are described above the What is that? -Help described (reachable via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. it is useful when you consider files in a previous session to the current project. this is useful when this feature is not used, even if this function is not used for you, so that you can already see the existing files and folder on the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. this function returns & K3b;, imported files from the current project. this function moves no files from the medium, it only ends the previously imported files again.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Opens the cd-copying dialogue. this also allows without project file the copying of a CD to another medium. alternatively, you can also burn a picture of a CD instead of normal copying. you should also prefer cloning if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Opening the DVD copying dialogue. this also allows the copying of a DVD to another medium. alternatively, you can also get the option of the cloning of a DVD with the help of copying dialogue. besides, the target medium has to be big enough to absorb the entire (video) data from the source mediums in the original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Opens the dialog to delete a CD-RW. this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Opens the dialog to the formatting of a DVD. with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R (W), thus the content is completely deleted. & K3b; lets you choose between desmodulate and incrementally.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Burns a previously selected CD-screen. the dialog asks you after a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as a data source, which can then immediately not be supported by pressures of burning cloves. (neros * .rg files are currently still not supported, therefore you have to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">Burns a previously erect DVD-image. the dialog asks you after a * .iso file as a data source, which can then be burned through pressures of burning cloves immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1473">A new video video can be turned into. this dialogue window appears usually after reading a DVD in the content view, but can also be used all-listed video, encoding settings and even possibilities for changing the size and cut black belts.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Displays information about the pickled medium. this information is represented in the content view and contain properties of the medium, such as size and titles of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Shows a list of the toolbar of & K3b;. if a entry is crossed, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">If this is crossed, a small body is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & K3b; and its activities. if this is not crossed, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">Folding the folder view one or from. the folder view includes an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives. if the content is enabled, the content is displayed in the content view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information, locking and unlock of the balance, or throwing the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">Switched the content view one or out. the content view allows the selection and pulling files into the project view. the content is also the interface to read audio or video-CDs, provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Switched the headbar in the project view one or out. the headbar is a narrow area that contains only visible when the project view has open projects. the headbar has no real function, it looks just pretty, and separates the project view clearly from the other views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This will open a dialogue window to changing the keyboards for & K3b; after having selected one of the statements in the upper part you can adjust the keypical order for it further down.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the K3b; input assistant. that allows you to adjust the correct authorations to burning CDs and DVDs. for this, Systemadministrator's right is required, therefore you will have to enter the password for the system manager (root).</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & K3b;. here you can customize general programming settings. nearly all features of & K3b; should work on Anhieb. this dialog is intended for personalisation and envisioning the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& K3b; is, like many other & kde; -applications also, with a & DCOP; -interface equipped with the help of this interface can be controlled by parts of the functionality for example through a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; -functions to use, you can either use the command line dcop, or to use the slightly more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical to the function of the function, therefore, rather your taste and the type of your task is decisive, which the included programs you can give.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume that you use the command line dcop. to use the & DCOP; you need to make sure that & K3b; start. then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; -features that have all & kde; program in common, supported & K3b; mainly two more parts that are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface between & K3b; features functions like copyCD, formatDVD and other features available for generating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">Echo () DCOPRef CreateRovixCDProject () DCOPRef CreateMovixCDProject () () DCOPRef CreateMovixCDProject () void hnCdImage (Curl url) void burnDvdImage (Curl url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject-method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef. # K3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project obtained via # dcop K3b K3bInterface currentProject Durch Comparing this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b provides the above mentioned K3bProjectInterface and the high-performance K3bDataProjectInterface which is only applicable on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (Qstring name, Qstring flags) void addUrl (curl:: List URLs, Qstring flags) void removeItem (Qstring path, Qstring newname) void setVolumeID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">So it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folder and then insert files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop K3b K3bInterface createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiophator; is an audio CD; -Boer for & kde; with it can be easily stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the machine which is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiences; is the user interface between cdparanoia (for reading & CD; -data in WAV files on the hard drive) and by many encoders (compressing compression) by default (This Kodierer packages will still need to be installed from the Linux distribution). other Kodierer can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; be read and stored in WAV files on the computer (simplify and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these WAV files (usually one per title) compressed into the MP3- or OGG format, or in other formats such as the lossy FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiences; cdparanoia. almost any distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must now be done.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step it must be installed (for MP3), ogging pre-up (for OGG) or other Kodierer. all these programs are usually not necessary for compiling the Linux distributions. however, only the coaches are not used to compile it. if for example FLAC is not used, the installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which Kodierer- / File-Format should be used? the chapter Which Kodierer gives a small introduction about Kodierer, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying from protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudiences; cdparanoia for reading the audio data from the & CD; and this program is not intended to handle any copying protection, it is not possible to handle any protected audio CD; not avoid the mechanisms of copying protection. simply avoid the purchase of copying audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While the setup has to be done only once (the setup dialog can be accessed as often as a suitable configuration), following the daily handling of reading a & CD; on the hard drive, this leads (hopefully) to understanding the slender approach of the interface, which you will often stumble in the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which body programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can't collect & CD; information from the freeDB from the Internet or can work completely without a network, whereby everything is captured manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of commands of the main window. on the side step by step example there are more information on how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the program's configuration for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Starts the CDDB enquiry according to the setup of inquiry in the CDDB file. (this can be local or online, in the latter case first the connection to the Internet must first be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Starts reading and - if a Encoder has been configured in the Settings menu 'tab - the coding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a submenu with a list of available encoder, so that selecting with another coder can be read as the standard. it's considered to be noted that previously the Encoder has been configured in the Settings menu.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, so that an already selected file is selected for coding instead of a full & CD; read and add.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the intersection to configure the type of notifications (such as protocols, Piepsen) for programming events (like reading the & CD; ends).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main introductory dialog by & kaudiences (such as Encoder, to set up the Encoders). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes key quality, codiers and compression, and helps you to choose the right code.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost is a veritable audio format required. besides FLAC there are also others like 'hormones' or 'monkey', which may be available for this distribution. the downsides are the small compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can be reinstated these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, data received by data compressing according to their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower Bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but over this bitrate, the differences are less important, as both Kodierer produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is still provided with most distributions for free but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ High to very high audio quality (at high bitrates), but compared with OGG easy to deepest quality for deep bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from one machine or a computer based musical system and / or if one of the few existing OGG defenses is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive), or special auto-stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices are usually only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A brief list of parameters for the audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good visibility to most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces and has already quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression mode up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi-stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression installment approximately 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music of juveniles, portable devices and autostereograms. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information provided manually or through the program automatically obtained from the freeDB via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can be transferred / used with & kaudiences; and the coding program to create the folder and file names as well as the characteristics of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with co-programmes, there is often a combination of program settings for the coders and these parameters. the manual or the help to the codiers declare the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; title to the keyword (English: day), if MP3s will be coded with lame, the switches must be added to lame and the title parameter of & kaudiences; the result looks as follows: '... -tt {*}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiences; parameters used (= Knock-drawing in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freeDB is: a free database in which people can download the audio CD, so that all the other information can be downloaded, instead within the calculator. it's considered to be noted that here only the text is spoken: & CD; title, artist, names of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes it should be legal, but I (Anm.) is not attorney. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; there is also information without the & CD; more or less worthless, so do not be added to the artist nor the music enterprise. all information can be dealt with at a stroll through a & CD; business, physically or virtuoso.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiences; is active to select a cross field (sending an address). for the use of freeDB may be used with another (counterfeit) address as the specified in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears, the e-mail address used for retrieving the data from the server (this can only be the programmer who reviewed the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are many countries copies of the main database. if & kaudiophator is set up; for the use of freeDB is needed, the geographical server is to be used on the next row of mirror. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the computers.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org delivers a current list of reflector for the online call of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually monthly created) just the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which excerpts is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that this cdparanoia is used, who wants to know more accurately, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; s. to note that the cdparanoia package has to be installed from the matching distribution first if this has not yet been done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For storing the selected WAV files, the coaster and therefore the desired file format are chosen for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a veritable compression for audio data) on the tab. other Kodierer can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer-package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the Kodierer can be used. this is also necessary for the predefined kodierer. more information about Kodierer can be found in the chapter Which Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a codification, you can obtain more information about his switch by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a consoles window (eg; Console). it must be replaced by the name of the installed codiers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check out the decor of the device-drawing of the & CD; / DVD drives, the writing and lesbian of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;) are installed. try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give an indication of what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the envelope of the & CD; This is not going to succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is one chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, these tips can give you how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, everything is understood, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by step example, and you will get enough information to set the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time to set up everything and our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme'using MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keyword (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. an appropriate package for lame can be found for example with a search engine, since it is not necessary to compile the source files, whatever you can do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you own it (eg; by trying to copy something to the conqueror something).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & kaudiences; something which probably is done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to proceed to read a & CD; what has to be repeated for each other & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the forced labeler to compression including the music (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). it is determined where the files are stored and which structure is used to use, we share the program with, the freeDB to use the & CD; data from the internet to download.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely not change it with each output of a & CD; if once the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device-labelling is handed over to the reading programme so that it can read the & CD; -Data / pieces can read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently, / dev / CDROM should be a symbolic link to the actual device designation of your drive. if this does not work or if more than a & CD; / DVD disk can be indicated, it also helps a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the available entries of the device files for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The map map General settings. there is not much to do here. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything will be shown as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only with complete information can be selected, so that you will be informed when data for generating keywords (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The map CD; -settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically downloaded over the Internet from a freeDB computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the machine must be connected while reading the & CD; connected to the Internet to access the freeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, a & CD; entry found, will immediately start reading the & CD;. this is associated with the database entry and the filename or day entries, they can easily change. the filename or filename is changed with conquerors - &gt; rename it and the ID3 tags with Kid3, dem & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example it is further to note: if you want to manually enter everything you want to download the selection field and freeDB will not be used. however, this about 620 MB length, you have to be selected with freeDB in the Offline mode, the two choices must be selected at least the first. mode is set up on the following map card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freeDB. these are settings for the data request, for retrieves the & CD; information from the freeDB-server via the Internet. how do the system, which data is to get the CD? read the section about freeDB. put everything like it is pictured in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we do not have downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to the page freedb.org and see it after a mirror. on this path the load is distributed between the bills. however, this setting will work as a first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function equating what the server concerns, but there are many firewalls to boot the protocol 8880 by default, maybe more luck with the protocol 80, since the & HTTP; protocol usually is open to surf the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to provide any & CD; data to the freeDB server; the first crossroad will deactivate.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Please read simultaneously: sorry, there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive? paralleled reading and code? the author does not know, therefore simply try itself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece, we cross it to the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you are covered this touch, then / must be stored on the path / folder in which the WAV files are stored. if the field is not covered, the files are created in the private folder. don't forget this folder if you want to make a something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Everything to be used as it is in the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under circumstances something to go to the right is to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is approximately 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and storage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the restriction of the generation of tags at version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted as required. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' day for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest like in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of members at the same time addiating WAV files: with a dual core or Quadcore, or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to add more than a WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That is, we have just finished the basic setup of & kaudiophator; this configuration is used as default for each output of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music enough, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section it is described as the process of output of the & CD; the folder structure, the type like the music on the hard drive is structured, as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freeDB will need to pick up. the process of the freeDB is described in this section, must be repeated for each other & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD; that is not yet contained in freeDB, see the screen photos a bit different from the data for a & CD; with successfully used by freeDB data. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data manually input, instead of pick them out of the internet. comments are to be noted on the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done so now the & CD; into the drive, it has been defined in the main window to be pushed back.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces should be listed in the window and their length in the window, just like in the screenshot. this only when the & CD; as audio CD; identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen, then seek in section questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Note: if the & CD; successfully managed by the freeDB, all the titles of the pieces are already filled out, and in addition, the artist's name and the album are also indicated.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; the key for your & CD; there is a window appears, and you can select the database entry that's best to your & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have the crossfire for automatic query of freeDB (on the page & CD; settings in dialogue for settings), you can also manually input this by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database but the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD-Editor - entering the CD-data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Specify the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen photo. the title of the piece in the first line of the 'Current title', the rest of the data in the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must not be given any more in the input field 'Current title' unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The bottom comment can be used for the individual comments inidividuem per piece, the comment field of the album will be used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful recall of the data from the freeDB is not empty, it contains already the data like in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to start the content of the CD-editor, so that you can not only start with the artist and album names (e.g. if all words with big letters start or not...) but also to examine if there are any unwanted comment.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1-tags. this option is limited to the length of fields on 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters in the commentary box. if you are ID3v2 tags; maximum this option will be set on the tab code and have a look at the section 'basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the day-information of the created files at any time with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all codians or file formats. see in the help for the Kodierer to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select one entry which is obviously agreeing with the style of the registrated CD; in this example this is not important because we don't transmit the & CD; for further information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example can be found under rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD Editors will be back and you see that the panels are already filled with the entered data that we've captured for the first piece. just enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. enter the title of the piece to any case and other information you want.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way to you all the titles of the & CD; have entered.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Note: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freeDB. it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third knob of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed about the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-sign in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are marked so are read out. a simple click on the line splits off the selection of the piece, or choose the button, select all the pieces at the bottom of the screen to choose all the pieces on a once.</seg>

<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: job 4 is the encoding of piece 1 in the format MP3. thus take place read and code simultaneously. notice the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration settings to lower this behavior. the only thing is configurable, the number of concurrent processes to read and code. with powerful machines, the result is unclear. the machine used with a AMD64 appears to have no problem with the simultaneous read and code (however two different pieces) to have.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last song is read, while another piece is coded and a third order in the queue of the codierers stands. after the last piece is coded, a small window will be built with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>

<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI-synthesizer, Awe, FM and CIS cards (for the latter you need the LUP drivers and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select... from the menu file. it appears the usual file dialog, with which help you can choose the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file by a & konqueror; -window into the & kmid; -window drop. this also works with several songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and bets the button absorb in the toolbar, select the item playing out of the menu piece or enter the empty paste.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; one piece automatically starts, once you draw it on the & kmid; -window drag. (if multiple pieces are added to a collection and then replayed in one another.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; one piece plays, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and cycle with the shelf.</seg>

<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored on two species in a piece of music. some pieces are using Textereignis, others use lyrics, and another both. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set which events are to be presented and even better: the event styling will automatically determine which a song will be used. if so, in the menu settings, settings will be selected automatically by the karaoke text, but you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other type.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set up an event type, select from the menu settings the entries of text events or songs events. the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which you summarize. these are played the series according to play. in this section you are able to use collections effectively.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, open first the collectors group. you will find them in the menu collection under the point Organize.... click there on New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and specify the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than a collection, you can adjust the gaps in collectors.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When using the application, this collection does not be stored. raise the if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collectors' camp. there, you can add a song using the button below. it appears in turn, the file dialog, with which help you can choose the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setup automatic add to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If automatic addition to the collection is activated, a piece of opening (under the use of file openings or drag & drop) automatically added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">When automatic add to the collection is not activated, the opening of a piece is the temporary collection activated and punches. this collection will then continue to be added to the included pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the Städelschule collection, select the collection and the desired song and then click away.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are shown. if you select the series following the sub-menu popups of the menus, the songs are shown in the order, as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or remove or random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collectors "collection, or use the listing list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump on a song, select the button of next song, the next song from the menu or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump off a song, select the button predestined piece, the entry previous piece of the menu pieces, or press the button on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collectors "collection, select there the extinguishing collection and click on the button Clear.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection can not be deleted. however, this doesn't matter because they are under the leaving of & kmid; not stored.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer which are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case the MIDI-Map General-MIDI-events in events that synthesizer the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI-map, which converts all events of the Type Change patch to Bright Piano in Events of the Change Change patch to Trumpet, and thus getting a trumpet, if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a soundcard, you do not need any MIDI map, because all soundcards are GM -compatible (including Awe - and CIS cards, FM radio devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI-Maps. so you have to edit the corresponding file from hand (using your favourite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-map is a text file, which stores all required parameters for the play of a piece of piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the KEYMAP section that may appear as often as desired. a prerequisite for this is that every appearance has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "name of the keymap..." END Define KEYMAP "A further keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail so that I can provide in future versions of & kmid; support may provide for devices that are not General-MIDI compliant.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section the patches of General MIDI are shown on your specific keyboard. general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equation is ignored. it is thought that the GM seeds are available in the right sequence (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and also no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional All KeysTo M is needed to put all the notes that this instrument need to put on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard, for example does not support gun barrels (e.g. with sound 60), which are similar to a gun powder. add the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (Win), it takes patch 100 (the Drum on your keyboard) and plays tone 60, regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the concept of Drum patch the patch is meant that every sound is a different perception tool (drum, basin, Maracas & etc;) and is not the one to which the tone means the tone of the always same drum. (like him some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to indicate how sounds are shown on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can use multiple keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keyboards are used primarily to convert tones to the Perkenslip channel. watch yourself as an example the included keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to impose some channels to others. if you want to exchange the first and second channel, simply get in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the perc on a specific channel (General MIDI to channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">Midi-Geräte need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section therefore has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N ist der Canal, which is shown on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keymap will need to be defined in the file name. if you're using the ForcePatch Option, all events will be ignored and are trying to change the patch on this canal. in this case, then patch is always used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful for example to always use the perc-resistant patch on the perc channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates that the relationship Pitch-Bender events will be multiplied with the value n, this with the formula n * (r / 4096) is calculated and then only conveyed. the value 4096 is used so that in the map file no decimalones are standing).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM indicates that a keyboard, which should play a pitcher event with the value 4096, a tone higher. unfortunately, however, try some keyboards around two notes up to an octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid; try it down.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-map, just open the dialog MIDI-settings. you can find this in the menu under Settings, point MIDI-settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The Kanalview is a window with a whole series of piano (one for each MIDI channel). on these pianos you can see which sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list, where you can choose an instrument, the knob is no longer green but red, to indicate that no more the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The Kanalview has (until now) two different views to view the played notes. the view can be displayed in the Settings menu under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed-LCD shows the speed with which a song is performed. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. therefore, if you find, a song is too fast, to follow the text, you can slow down. to change the pace, use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that has to be played on how a piece of music must be played. it contains the notes, the speed, speed, & etc.. this allows the same MIDI file to perform two different devices to very different results, just as two different musicians play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs around 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you get a similar sound quality. if a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc. you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This may happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; don't have that happen because & kmid; without Awe support was compiled to remove the issue you need to download a source of distribution and install (for example by kmid; 's startpage)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I do not want to add all the files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Disagree, therefore support & kmid; Drag & Drop. open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files and drag them onto the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Previously you activate the settings automatic to add to the collection. otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can taste the arrows icon at the left from Tempo- LCD, to slow the playback. to restore the standard tempo, you can double click on the LCD screen.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; working space a & conqueror; -window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; if I want to play a MIDI file or I want to play a file, simply move into the & konqueror; -window change and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid; draw.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file a file without adding them equal to a collection, you turn to adjust to an automatic add to the collection and the new; a file is added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first, you only want to play the first file. so make your settings automatic add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then unlock yourself, including B.mid and C.mid to play and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. all the heartfelt thanks! if I hear these songs or the postcard watch, animates me to set on & kmid; to program.</seg>

<seg id="1712">The categories' aktuelles', television and thumb playlist can also be changed by direct edit the XML configuration files. naturally, you can only do that if & kmplayer; not running through an editor, but also by application itself. simply click on a name of a category clicked on the menu view and the next editing mechanism. by the clipping of a sub-group, only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, must be selected from the menu with playlist and select either the editing module, or be selected to another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost if the processing modus leave or another group will be chosen without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Owing to the convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some functions can only be switched by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during starten and finishing can be disabled by the edit of ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and Change by [General Options] No Intro = 0 obiger option on '1'. if the option is not available, it can be simply inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate a different animation. & kmplayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / p / kmplayer / intro.xml and ~ / .k/ / share / p / kmplayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during starters need not be short, it will automatically terminate by opening another source. this would be annoying at the end-animation, however, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be the ads of a favorite pictures; & lt; img dur = "file: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif" fit = "meet; & lt; / smilgt; In the source Package by & kmplayer; are in the directory tests / some examples of smil die of & kmplayer;</seg>

<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here is the output of mplayer visibly.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this playunit in the configurations dialog by & kmplayer; everything must be configured out by manual work of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayblc. here is an example like a 'flash' with the module swfdec-mozilla is installed:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash' can be played within & kmplayer; it can even be inserted in the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>

<seg id="1725">The conqueror or & kmplayer; is in a consoles application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library. if there is no mistakes, the backend output is inside & kmplayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu to check).</seg>
<seg id="1726">So that always a blueprint for a particular MIME type is taken (of course only when this was also identified), this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayblc. for example, phoneon all ogg files again:</seg>

<seg id="1728">For Configuration of VDR (Video data Recorder) settings in kmplayer is the dialog in the settings below - &gt; Quelle- &gt; XVideo Port to use. there should be detected ports to be selected (e.g., it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a DVB in this.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR can take advantage of kmplayer only XVideo, XVideo should also work (most likely, this type of play video will be working on Linux. this is why the videoforlinux extension to work for the X server should therefore be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config) in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>

<seg id="1752">Just as other signatures includes & latex; an introduction, with which the generalization properties like paper format, page numeric and text grinding class, the KÃ ¶ rper begins with the command\\ begin {Document} and must be closed with the command\\ end {Document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The fast-level assistant of & kile; is a well-known feature for the quick creation of a document in & kile; the selection of the assistant (MENU) provides some possibilities for the document creation.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document folders: this type of document is used: article (article), book [book], article [report], article (DIN) [hamnocl], report (DIN) [hamster], projector [beamer], slides [prosper] or custom.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Coding: this is hereby set the character coding of the system. modern systems are used increasingly the UTF-8 -coding as standard. best, UTF-8x should be washed (for correct processing of & latex; -documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list has the usually used additional packages for & latex; for incorporating the incorporation it merely washed in the crosswise.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), Book (DIN), Report (DIN): the documentation of the Coma-Script (to comply with German DIN-regulations). you should always use the use of German texts.</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users have no worries to worry. it is just a short description of the functions and further information in this section are given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& cile; offers - as much as other source editors - the highlighting of the used commands, settings and elements (as well as the unsuitable). through & cile, it is incomparably noticed that any mathematical environment is not closed. however, it is uncovered by the modest appearance of the output file. however, it saves time and saves time with the highlighting time and covert.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With automatic transmissions the environments is created by entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) by & kile; automatically a space line (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be activated in the menu. (e.g.\\ end {command}).</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into some elements. & latex; grant the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the box and subset the lowest element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structural view, the single elements can be changed and seen by a mouse click on the respective models.</seg>
<seg id="1763">In creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful, jumps & cile. once a DVI; -file [framed B) jump & cile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -viewer for the corresponding line in the & latex; -source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; -file contained a description of the format document and other information such as font. or & latex; and there are many tools to view, conversion and print out of DVI; -files for various systems and coats.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the return device, the elements of DVI; -file is loaded with the editor and once on a item in the DVI; -source code has been coated, the exact opposite of it. once upon a section in & latex; the code has been clicked, the corresponding location in the DVI; -viewer will slick.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, working with other integrated .tex files will be simplified. when using a project, a project-wide Master document can be adjusted to project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result automatically appears (if no error in the source code are presented).</seg>
<seg id="1768">Filesize: in this mode, the DVI; -file on Ã "nderunâ s, Ã ¼ berwachtâ, and there is no call for & ocular: after screening.</seg>
<seg id="1769">In viewing the beware of the toolbar, the three groÃ ¢bles en selections should be stricken. the initial selection field has been developed for rapidly import of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The transitory & latex; -commands for the division are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection field Other is for the addition of articles such as tags, Fuzhou notes or notes. the following possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command a name for a section, a picture or other element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: will be used for reference to a festive designation (selection to a selection field).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using citation there is a selection list with literary entry. for the work of & bibtex; -files are corresponding editors, and the author has good experience with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; -files can also be written in & kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-box with the name GrÃ ¶ é e is used for determining the typewriter, for the main text, the FULL notes etc. there are the following fonts:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & cile; two choices are available: 1. the assistant for the preparation of a new document by selecting the document types and cutters. 2. the document may be written down by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets for the command\\ documentate contain the settings for the command. the attitude [12pt] lays the writer [12pt], the writing is not set at the beginning, this can also happen spontaneously in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code has been given, the & latex; -source code must be compiled. the simplest way of this is the use of the MENU's building or bone quick structure.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The code must be saved in front of the compiling. & cile; for the storage is automatically saved.</seg>
<seg id="1779">SchlÃ ¤fies the compiling of the document flawl, should be searched in recording according to the errors. if using quickstructure, & ocular should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the recording should also be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1780">A environment (ensee environment) is a text that will be treated differently from the restful document. for example, a report with the writing process is supposed to have a different font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ HUGE and\\ end {environment} expires sofar the Ã ¼ noses of the writing-grass roots within the area (ensee HUGE).</seg>
<seg id="1781">The cuts are only within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no circumcisions (number) for the cuts within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to brighten the readability and usability of the document. there are e.g. certain fonts, liabilities, cursant, submissions, etc. are added. these commands either end with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the cursive and is long as long as it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a sentence can be presented with\\ emph {word} italic.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {rate} and ends with\\ end {rate}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to writing the source text with the & latex; -recording session was shown, now follows a step-by-step guide for the creation of a document in & cile;</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once in assistants a bit of text was given, a few adjustments for the better legibility of the document should be accomplished. in this case, a quotation, a few places in the fat and cursive and a poem comes to the application to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document was seen, using editor's view or Strg E can be used again to the editor (with internal viewers). in an external viewer, its windows must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; the file was created, the document can be printed or used in a & PostScript; / PDF file will be converted. simply try and Spaak.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a structured file format (Engl. D e V ice I ndependent). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for reading the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printer, & PostScript; / PDF -Umwandler or Computerbild.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing a & DVI; -file are the same steps as for the preparation of the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can be printed (if the printer is right).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar form the conversion of DVI; -file in other formats. once the DVI; -file from the & latex; source code was created, the conversion into certain other formats can begin using the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The precaution plight the direct jump from editor to perish position inside the DVI; -file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& cile; offers a corresponding setting for all & latex; binaries. this is only necessary to integrate modern under settings medication... tools Bauen balanced.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To relocate the precaution, the mouse-cursor in a row of the source text, and asleep on VorwÃ ¤rtssearch. the jump to the corresponding location in the DVI; the viewer will take place.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & ocular, with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; -document of & cile; attached and to the appropriate line. you have to set up & cile; in & eyepiece; as the text editor will be specified (Settings Okular... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If in case of scaffing the & DVI; the viewer should not be Ã ¶ ffed, there may be a mistake. should be a mistake, this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The protocols file claned the error source in source. in the Editor, there are always the line where the error appears. in order to view the faulty line, the error must be clicked on the faulty line, and must be clicked on the faulty line; jump to the faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once on the corresponding knob in the toolbar, a window appears to choose the template for the template for the document.</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting single document, a document can be written from scratch or the assistant for a quick creation of a new document. more information can be included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Ugly users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for nearly all documents. templates can be created, stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, you must create an existing & tex; - / latex; -file must be created or create a new file. & cile; can create a new template using an existing document and selection of document templates.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document, a template used by file new will be replaced by other data (such as name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in settings bugs. settings are set up.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is imperative to know which fonts are replaced by which variable:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering in document class. typically they are used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of assistants and the instructions of the commands in the editor. once the document was created in this way, the following steps have been completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, its own template can be balanced instead of default value.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; process files will be created a simple way to create a template, should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& cile; used & Kate; as an internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting of many different types of text files (including also & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for that you can directly out of & cile;</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about e & Kate; and its possibilities should be attracted to Kate. users of & kile; you can start working directly with the reading of the chapter with the editor of & Kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; offers a very practical & latex; commanding reference, which can be called the chipping LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands, which can be found in & latex; use can be used as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">A double-clicking with drÃ ¼ ter Strg button to woven the & tex; and that means that in this way click "\\ par\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="1812">At the pulling of the text with penetrated linker, the full text is automatically copied into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow buttons with penetrated circulating button, can be washed parts of the source text in the editing window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& cile; has the ability to browse the most different kinds of source texts and emphasise this. for example, the & latex; -commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many wizants can be included in the window. these are a separate type of bookmarks within the text. the menu features, or the corresponding keyboards, so that it is emphasized at the first input of a string automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Finding a program is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like & cile; and though & Kate is added; important functions for writing a & latex; source code was added. & latex; special commands for their selection. among editing them, the following commands are included in the text selection:</seg>
<seg id="1817">WÃ ¤hlt a complete paragraph (group of lines contained on both sides (like in other text files). this advanced importance asleep with it with tables, & latex; -commands and all other lines of source code. the only exploiting cause is in & kile; therefore, that the scoursing is separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Wake up the word under the current Cursorption position. this selection also has an advanced meaning as this command also & latex; -commands with a return surface (\\) and a given star (*) at the end fails.</seg>

<seg id="1824">If the cursor in front or within the command\\ begin {surroundings} is found at the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">In the entry of many merging environmental commands can be quickly lost sight. this command asleep the last seen surrounding area, so that the eventual environment structure is not reignited.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; -groups, which are determined by brackets {...}. under Bees TeX-Group are a few important commands, to which comply with the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command at the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). cursor will be placed directly in front of the curves clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command at the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor will be placed directly behind the curved brackets.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor before or behind the curly clamp of a & tex; -group # is, becomes the other end of the group (or vice-versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">In the entry of many welded groups-brackets can be lost quickly the Ã ¼ berish view daring. this command asleep the last seen group, so the screwed structure of the & tex; -groups does not crush.</seg>

<seg id="1838">Although Therm; already has a good source of code, it was installed in & kile; for special commands (usually for & latex;) again. these are three according to the need and the other two are for automatic transmissions. all these modes can be adjusted for different workings in settings.</seg>
<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment using the command\\ begin {surroundings}, & kile; automatically add the command\\ end {surroundings} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">At the bottom of the return-taste, the last letter is removed from entering and allow it to fold the comprehension list. on the other hand, the list can also be resized by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands will be written with a brief description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions are removed from a command. alternatively, jumping stamp will be noted, so that a simply jump to these positions by means can be possible jumping stamp NÃ ¤chste springmarke can be used.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Among settings kile; invent... cile; substating settings to these lists are made. there are different winding lists for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as anger of common language.</seg>

<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explaining. nickname is the user name of the user and serves as clear identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member may have several roles in the project, such as both teamleader and subproject leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this happens by selecting the team member from the list and put the button replace than pushare. the currently selected member (their identity) appears to be named after you are: text.</seg>

<seg id="1956">MIME types: Mimetyps to detect different types of files. using the button standard, the default privileges can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard report encoding: the coding of newly created or used in a different way than with file opening open files (where the coding of the file can be passed), but this setting here is out of the same in the project features, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD will be used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD was not recognized, but this setting here is out of the same in the project features, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates regular backup copies, so that with a blackout or crash when the next start of the program can be recovered from this backup, it's not the same as the storing of the file. even for not stored documents a backup is regularly created, according to the time created.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editorfield or in their own view (or the documentation in a box), which makes it possible to see the documentation, the preview and the source text at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="1962">The warning-off area serves the control of the possibility to inquire the ad of warnings by hooks of non-inquire.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place for the behavior of & VPL; to change. it can be defined by symbols instead of scripts, just as the synchronization of the VPL- and the source text in the tagged mode. in terms of the different modes, see.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structural tree, which represents the illustration of the Parser-knots in the document to be adjusted in details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the case of mouse-click on the structural baum, the following action is possible to change the action by clicking the structural tree with the mouse-necessary action.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the area of structural tree settings the visibility of knot in the tree, the actualizations of the building, and how deep in changing the structural tree will be automatically open. empty Nodes are the empty areas in the text, whereas empty groups such are found in which the current document is not found an item.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area for the solidation of abbreviations (a kind of templates) that can be trunfolds on extensive use. abbreviations are valid for several & DTEP; s may be valid for several & DTEP; s can exist, it can be a valid group for PHP, in which the ifclause abbreviation is something different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here the plug-ins are managed. plugins are KPart-Applications of third-page, which can be reused by any KPart-capable application, at the most known & conqueror;. in inserting a plug-ins the following must be stated:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin, if it is not located at a standard flat as $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is handed over to the plugin for the start, so it can open the current file (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Component in "Just read" mode: check if the plug-in is denied the shop. only read-the Parts usually refuse the shop, if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Reassed the plug-in: is this enabled, then testet & quantaplus; whether the given information is correct. pick the plug-in also if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, the troubleshooting was completely new. DieSupport for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger was adjusted, as well as support for the dbg debugger. instead of it became a debugger-plug-in concept, which allows various implementations of plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plugin is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; included.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project begins with the selection of a proper debugger plug-ins in the project settings. with the button options next to the Debugger-Plugin selections can change the specific settings.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If for a project a debugger activates, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; -user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view where the content of monitored variables is displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view where all holding points are listed, line numbers and conditions are usually listed. usually it appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is shown. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action the connection to the debugger, if required, or she shares the plug-in with, on debuzzlement. this action is being executed by default when a project is opened, that a debugger is not used, so that it is not necessary to notice a debugger.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debug meeting starts the session. closes the connection to the debugger or terminates the laugh of requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Send a HTTP server request to the server to submit a debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to watch the current document. the issue of this requirement is displayed in the view debugger issue.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Points the debugger, begin with the execution of the script and information about the surveillance variables as well as the currently executing line. if this happens while the script is attached, the execution continues, before a debut requirement was started, the script starts with the requirement.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Points the debugger, to begin with the execution of the script, without information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens when a script has been halted, the execution continues, the execution starts as soon as a requirement is placed.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger guides the next directive to enter the script without limitation to the functions or applications.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger guides the next directive on the script, whereby if possible in functions and includes fail.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Shows the debugger to pass the instruction and go to the next so if there is no current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog, in which a variable or an expression may be given to supervised. the supervised value appears in the variation view.</seg>

<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes every element in detail. everything about the possibilities and borders is presented in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of an TagXML document. it can occur only once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains as a only element type over itself nothing else.</seg>

<seg id="2028">The simplest promotions. it can be inserted a text in the detailed settings and in carrying out the action, this text is inserted in the document on the current Cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the mightiest action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually script, but it is not limited) to change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document); even the Quick start -dialog or the various See in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and interpreter must be stated. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified pathade allows, it is advised to use the% scriptdir variation in the command line: $KDEDIR / share / p / quanta / share / p / quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH It gives other special variable which can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we are replaced with the URL of the current document. in the event of a local document file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; -process running. when it runs from & quantaplus; only one instance is running, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; from the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, normally the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above mentioned methods, a script should be advised of & quantaplus; to the standard input. in the selection field you can be determined what is to send to the standard input. possibilities are:</seg>

<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to subdivide the tags in logical groups. in the given case, it is not too many, therefore one can create a toolbar using the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you must add actions and configure. select settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explaining. pressing the new action button at the bottom of the window starts the editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all the necessary fields and add them to the same toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the day attributes, and you are planning to plan their use, activate a dialog "day" when available, so that you can enter an entry when it is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Ignorant! is this a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? replace it before we face difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represented, we will use & kiconedit. select from the & kmenu;, Grafik Further Programme (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, choose Bees Size andern.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon will not only help you to remember what action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="2047">In mind that the day start, I decided to create a start knob as a symbol. by using green (green is usually interpreted as being rigid, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user signaled that clicking on this symbol is a & lt; startgt; -tag in the current document will insert.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it must still be connected to the promotion. this happens over the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. besides the text box there is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored icon is, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the apply button and continue with other tags, so there is still which, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to complement some usual & quantaplus; -functions to the toolbar, or it should be shared with the better overview by some separators in several groups. open the toolbar set up dialogue about settings toolbar. make sure that the toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (very left above) for my toolbar. after the selection of the element, that is to be added to the toolbar, push the arrow down to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the conqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note, as the separators support grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar, could believe that the & konqueror; -button the opposite of the start-button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by proxy of all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure you in the right folder. after NeueXML does not exist, there are imregularities (s) should be stored in the right folder. please match her & descriptionrc; so that their toolbar is loaded (s), if a file is opened from the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable addition of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the opportunity to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language that you like most. therefore, describes this chapter as I create a & PHP; document tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository, whether someone has done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you must seek an existing documentation for the formatt.net / script / etc. language. then you have to leave the docrc file. the first part we leave you, the second we treat here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configurations file [Tree] Doc dir = Path, relatively to this file, including the document library, e.g. php42 / # items in the main index top item = your description for this documentations = presently 1, tag2, tag2, tag2, taginput1 = tag2.html tag2 = tag2.html _ 2 = tag2.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the document tree. for instance, you can see this example in PHP & PHP; documentation is something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element = PHP 4.2, # 4.2 Manual = Table of Contents, # Getting started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # Getting started and Language Reference. this shows that there is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known border for chess column (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the content is referenced directly to a file (and more consequential at the top of the Baumantle & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Space affect nothing, but watch out & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; Resourcendateries are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file, which is to be displayed for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. by flagging of function and pressures of Ctrl; H for context-help the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the contextlist (ContextList) and the file-mandatory lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of complemented context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc / share / p / quanta / share / p / quanta / doc / p / quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (so as you specified this in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you're confident that this is good and it's worth to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation were used to the & quantaplus; -Repository for the use by the & quantaplus; -community. they will not be rich, but proud to be involved in the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; are you not alone. it is possible to divide the streams (DTEP packages, toolbar with campaigns, scripts, styles) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by means of an email to friends, partners or otherwise. at different places there is an email to send menus, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with an email send, in the context menu of files and folders in the Templates and scripts in the scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all the others & quantaplus; -users can be downloaded and only available when our team needs them as accurate and beneficial for publication. to take advantage of the resources that it needs a GPG / PGP key. therewith, the origin of the resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for later user.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for your passport for their private GPG key (the Passphrase is not stored), or in the event that you have multiple keys you can choose to. in the dialogue New resource, the input cells (URL can remain empty) and click OK to load the blast load.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The uploading can upload from the menus DTD DTD package (DTEP) to upload, toolbar, and in contextmenu of files and folders in the Templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still prior to installation, investigates & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by examining the integrity and Signating. in the case of problems there is given and the resource is given correctly. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the statement of the resource of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML-languages, which is currently not yet supported by & quantaplus; it is necessary to work by creating a DTEP package. however, the creation may be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files in the tagXML format could be necessary. there's the easiest way to convert an DTD automatically to a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started by the DTD shop and convergence of a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which should be used. then the following dialogue appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target-drawn name: the newly created & DTEP; will be written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / p / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitionszeile: the string, which in! Doctype Day, like HTML PUBLIC / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine setting of the DTEP after conversion: when activated, brings & quantaplus; after the transformation the & descriptionrc; -Editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. to understand these to understand and get full benefit from & quantaplus; therefore, one must first bring them to this fundamental concept, without their understanding & quantitative; little benefits.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; is the workspace divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available to anyone, the & quantitative. utilization, available. from toolbar about actions it is all that is marked as global, in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; stored. this enables the group of administrators different toolbar, actions and patterns in the global tree will be available to anyone in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements provide a personal collection of webdesigns for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and materials. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that it can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; -patterns to toolbar with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project. simply said, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, making the common use of special tools and patterns of all staff within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editorwindow, den Baumanifs, den Karteiern with info and the toolbar. please suggest in, and for further information on these fields.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the boxes with the right mouse button, to obtain an account-menu with the current document, like include the current, other or all boxes, recharging, delete or uploading the document, jump to a bookmarks or version of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click menu in the Editorarea lead to a further context menu with regard to the editing document, such as basic processing steps (cutting / copy / paste), processing the file under the mouse-cursor or opening the file, if the string is called under the mouse-cursor a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editors are the toolbar of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional als Standard an, for which a set of toolbar is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus; the toolbar adapted to the new functions and the associated user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbar is really easy. if they want to insert a single day, e.g. & lt; then click on the symbol that tag the day. now, they can insert the data for this just added day. if they want to insert the data for this just added day. if they want to insert a day that has several attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The buildings (QIT;) allow it to navigate in the information & quantaplus; to navigate and to pass it. in the presentation with cartels stand for files, project, patterns, script structure, scripts, and documentation Baumanviews available.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool, which provides & quantitative. this view shows all the files in the project and allows the comparing of files in the project using right mouse click. actions like adding, removal, uploading or deleting the files from storage media can then be performed with the current context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another way of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole web page & etc. there are options open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on which they are used. the category depends on & quantaplus; -Working range. global styles are always available, local styles only available for the corresponding users and templates in projects are available only in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of fixing in Global, Local and Project also functions here. by clicking on the right mouse button, you can retrieve the available information about a script. the right mouse button are available, such as the script to start, edit or send it with EMail.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view one shows the internal structure of the active document. by links-clicking a element, the Cursor in the document is set to the position of the element. through the right-click of an element. it opens a list of commands with regards to navigation and refresher the building.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree seems to be under the other construction views. with it, some some attributes and namespaces change. the search tool allows to change all available attributes with a few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation for the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; by the quantaplus; 'document site can be downloaded, and by adding a folder doc to a project may be added to project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two boxes leading at the bottom of the window, can be achieved through the beneficial information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This map provides information about each in Quanta running script. so, for example, the DTD of the current document used and all changes to the DTD will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This cardboard box shows all errors in the market up of the current document. & quantitative; -Scripts that are executed, give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbar are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the Chocolate side of the toolbar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in & quantaplus; to define.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar using EMail. & quantaplus; send the toolbar as the compressed Tar archive by & kmail;. if they receive a toolbar in an EMail, they can safeguard them in & quantaplus; like any other secure and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable when you want to adjust the place of & quantaplus; -Files to adjust to your system. for this, autograph provided a number of options that can be transferred to the configure script. to understand a complete list of all options, give. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have trouble downloading & quantaplus; have you to verify whether your path contains the & kde; 3 am folder. also, you should ensure that no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH before their bin folder. same applies to & Qt;</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web-developped tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; was optimized for a rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a multitude of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While the effort to create the best & HTML; -Editor, the developers began to employ & quantaplus; an independent, extendable Markup-Sprachen Editor? well, this would make it the absolutely bigger web-developped tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML, is & quantaplus; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive Web-development tool. if you can define it in & XML; define, then should & quantaplus; for this, be the appropriate & IDE.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim to be detained that & quantaplus; as a product is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; development community, which is already developed? thanks to the & kde; -Germa is not only this possible but it allows users and developers, & quantaplus; to expand as they need it for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; enables webdesign to boost the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can increase the productivity dramatically. by means of the program compiling them & quantaplus; expand without getting irting a scripting language database.

<seg id="2114">& quantitative; is currently developed and cared for by Eric Laffoon sequencing @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access from files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not placed in it, with the oldest entry.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use. look in the section templates. should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only an error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Convert into inserting the clipboard there included special characters to the & HTML; -cription, so that it is displayed correctly and is not misunderstood by the browser as a formattas instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Convert the text from the clipboard in & URL; -cription, which is the correct way to inserting special characters and spaces in & URL; s. first and foremost to inserting & URL; s in the anchor.</seg>

<seg id="2122">Shows the news window or not. this is the window where you see the ad of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">- and turn on the problem sweeps on the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem position is activated once you change to the structural tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Shows the symbolise left of the main window. this column allows you to put bookmarks with a single click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">When there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries or next, depending on the position of the Cursors in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from hard drive. & quantitative; projects are stored with the file's turn .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog to include files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied into the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory according to new files that might be there. this will allow for example to copy graphic files into your project folders or a sub-folder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Load the files in your project on the server high. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have further inputs / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, as & quantaplus; the project managed. in the chapter & quantaplus; -Projects you will find the details explained.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads of a project toolbar. these are stored in project you / toolbar and are only in this menu if you have applied to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to store your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this creates only the name. actions must set up using settings actions... to be added manually or you are asked when you ask the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Remove a toolbar from the field of view. the deletes does not remove them from the hard disk. if you have not saved the toolbar you are asked if you would like to do it.</seg>
<seg id="2136">So you can send your own material to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; -team so that the toolbar exists in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the uploading of toolbar on the main server, where anyone can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download one & DTD; that you have done or ironing someone else and convert into the & quantaplus; own description.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Loading / stripping of the entities of the & DTD; it makes sense when the entities are from the & DTEP; if this is global and a writing at the global KDE folder does not exist, fails the shop.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu includes a list of tags, which is available in the current toolbar. if the standard is loaded, there are in the tags menu a sub-menu standard, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day entry dialog, if there is one. this entry is always present in the menu tags, followed by & DTD; -specific underlining.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activated or disables the smart insertion of tags. currently this works only with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent paste means that & quantaplus; this inserts using the toolbar, if this day contradicts the rules.</seg>

<seg id="2147">Immediate envelope between the different types of user interface. due to some restrictions in the KDE libraries, the envelop sometimes need time need or imitable graphics. recommended, the cardboard box mode, which is also default, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open subwindow. using a selection, the appropriate subwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switched the display of the status bar at the bottom of & quantaplus; main window to or from.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog box any application that use the KHTML-Part, including the & Conqueror; -Webbrowser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Judge the behaviour of the editors. in the documentation of & Kate; you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears, in which you can delete entries from the toolbar or to add or change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create an aid in accordance with the context of the mouse cursor, but it is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantitative, is a high-quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project, developers can always need help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form they find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled best from top to bottom, for example after filling out the project called the whole filing structure for the rest of the project automatically complements. all these paths and author-information fields can later be adjusted with Shift; F7 project project characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to enter, for example foo. in entering the name, file is automatically filled out.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of & quantaplus; -Project file. by default, it has the name of the project in small bushing and without spaces with extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you will find the server address of the machine that you want to access, one, except you can edit local data. either a name (hostname.nam.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">Lets this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocols may be used. depending on the adjustment of the remote host, an adjustment may be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates for the project are stored. it is a relative path to the project and by default. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, these folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the toolbar can be stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbar. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, these folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local filesystem into the project. it can be selected several files or entire folder.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. at serverbal script (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc.) you have to go differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Contakt, if files, which are part of the project somewhere in the main folder of the project. if a project is started on new, not anhooks.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option all files and folders are displayed within the root folder and you can make a precise selection of a landfill.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files from the hook or by removing the head, cling out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The final screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project features in the menu item in the subwindow Profile, or change with the shortcut shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in. additional items will be explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filename (placeholder is possible) which will be reread by project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Supplementary option on the top, also files which are listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when opening the project. in can read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the requested debugger selected. currently, only Gubed will be supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set with the options button. in the debugging is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the sub-window profiles can be adjusted high ladeprofile (see in), as well as display a building view for the content of the server for each profile, by drawing up an own layout for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the sub-window team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see in the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the sub-window event, you can switch event actions and add or delete these actions. event actions are executed when a previously mentioned event occurs, such as the sickness of a file. see into the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, it opens and quantaplus; the last project, which was open. this behavior cannot be influenced by now.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, select Project... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is automatically saved. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantaplus; changed files. same happens when you load a new project.</seg>

<seg id="2181">Here you can choose different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the upload files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows the removal of the current profile. if only more a profile is present, the button abgeblends to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in memory and forget about programming. this possibility is useful when common uploading files is necessary and the more unsafe password on the record -option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog until you change your opinion prior to the uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many high profile profiles can be uploaded, and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded on different servers. when working or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server that is to be copied to the files. either a fully qualified domain name or IP address function.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transcript protocol for the uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed KIO slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not need to be changed, except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your attacking sound, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it according to your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it can not be easy to read, but everyone can see with programming.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just one set of files and toolbar. it can be used in a project a lot of views, i.e. by simply changing the view can be loaded multiple files and toolbar and replace the currently selected files and toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be accessed in the menu project or the project-toolbar, accessible via settings toolbar-toolbar, open or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with whom to do most. this helps not only increase productivity but also allows modification of & quantaplus; to the own working method.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above are the toolbar in & quantaplus; best embroidered by the menu toolbar. use and adding are different. adding the toolbar is treated down in the section Protection of toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the symbols can be adjusted either by means of the context menu (right-click on the toolbar), other actions such as the toolbar, remove the toolbar, or toolbar, can be specified in the dialog, where the actions can be displayed on this or other toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, the entries are also removed and action edited, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings toolbar... and settings actions can be set.. adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are in essential documentas, code cutlets and files to shortp. & quantaplus; used as a basic file system with an independent organization and interfaces. you can copy, move, or any existing folder in the pre-layer tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the limitations one provides for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; mitigated templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions presented at the beginning of each template, prior to use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binär is all that is not pure text. it can be every file except text, so images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary templates are usually included in documents using shortcuts (e.g. pictures with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the substore tree under global styles. further information on the Templates tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created from any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. you usually makes a simple framework for the purpose and organising the work in appropriate way to efficiently be found. some examples may be found in the store tree under global styles. see in for more information on the Templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful when not a new document is based on a template but the same text area again and again inserted in the documents. you can find everything from a comment on an endnote up to a complete flow system on Javascript or Perl. some examples are available in the store tree under global styles. see in for more information on the Templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates stand for whole web sites as templates. they are a collection of different documents that can be organized in a folder structure, founded in a compressed tar archive. currently, there are no examples in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure to Belieben (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and save the file as templates...</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has happened, you notice that (even if it is stored as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the subtree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click on file When you store your choice as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be easily drawn with pulling and sealing to the building state templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: to copy the file only into one position folder. all file management functions can be used for it, such as pulling and insert, or inserting over the file tree of conqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">In the file tree, or in the project files, you can click on a folder on the right and provide site template, backed up a name for the template and secure. by default, the project folder is guaranteed, but of course it can be used as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates will enable you to outline headlines and footsteps, or dynamically with & PHP; design, insert files or with them. additionally, you can keep some things in mind in projects very profound in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The pre-storage structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files embedded in $KDEDIR / share / p / quanta / share / p / quanta / load-fed files. each of this folder is equivalent to one of four types of container, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">In order to set the behavior of a folder, right click on the folder and select in the context menu of the folder and in the context menu of the Account. the following Dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection field with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is low as soon as Elterous attributes have been halted.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is by default, and fits all except the stem cells in the deposits. if a regular folder would basically deactivate, unless they would be explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folders, the blah would appear with something such as text-stone. if nothing appears, one is probably in a trunk folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows previous or published text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines or footer for all templates for a specific project, enabling copying of ingredients in a folder of special headlines / footprints a full presentation already to match the matching headlines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have the context menu (pointing out, right mouse button) about a complete command collection for adding folders or copy, and insert templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & Quelltext editor, replaced by the VPL; -Editor and the Second shares the editors in two parts: the source Editor and the VPL; -Editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; -Editor works like this: he loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and switch in the source code editor, where the changes done in the VPL; -Editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; -Editor on a document, the & PHP; contains a small green symbol the Vohandance of & PHP; -source code. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; -Editor. to edit, is still necessary to change the source editor. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode is just like the first, except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source Editor and in VPL; -Editor sync. with pressures of F9, this mode is already active, the key pressure puts the active cursor from a window to another, while the position is maintained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation gap between the VPL; -Editor and the source code is adjustable using settings Quanta. in the selection automatically you can choose between synchronization by one click or automatically. basically, the recommendation is recommended: a small margin for fast computer and a large margin for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the web page, such is tools to choose document properties. this is the work of invisible tags at work with the VPL; -Editor becomes possible, once a new document is created with the VPL; the editor will also be created. this is because of the reduction of the penduler Kodierens. this allows you to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-tags allow the storage of information about the document themselves e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed. a click on the list allows modification of the content, such as key words on the column names and keyword key wort2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS-rules are the new way of drawing up pages in the browser. you can delete or delete CSS-rules using the buttons below the list. the editing of CSS-rules is currently not currently supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS-style template by pressing to the file button and select the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the Cursors is like in a text processing, possible by carriage with the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the Cursor behaves as usual. the markings works as usual. text can be inserted through objection, and deleted by means of pushbutton or removal.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is made in the same way via the toolbar, as in the source code. it's considered to be noted that inserting tags previously already existing identical tags, for example, if an anchor tag, is inserted with text, every other surrounding anchor must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some workshops as the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled. you will later in & VPL; work in this release, the tables or lists of materials are used.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparisons. why so & kdiff3;? let me tell me briefly why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The conduction was very complicated because one of the contributions made many changes, while at the same time corrected the re-refunding. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was a lot of conflicts to collapse.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines. and there was no evidence of the places where maybe only the removes had changed. that's why this change was a little nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">So this was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a row and changes to white signs. later, any number of other useful features have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare your text quickly, simply copy it into the clipboard and add it in one of the comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function which made a lot of work was the comparisons and perform of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a complete file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way-assembled is fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently of each other at a piece of code and make changes. the final text (the base) helps solve the correct evaluation. in this editor you can even edit the result. in this Editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot displays three Quell files when they are introduced:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you with the comparisons and perform complete folder. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; at the folder-assembled:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and rejects the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often have to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabs are displayed visible. if lines are only different in a certain number of white signs, one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble when someone is someone who happens.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">When a file is equal, and the other is different at a row, the colour displays which file is different. red colour means both files are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can easily make yourself the tipent work by using only the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Collator 1 folder 2, folder 2, folder 2, folder 2, folder 2, folder 2, folder 2, folder 2, folder 2, folder 2, folder 2, folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The Open dialog allows the manual typing of filename, selecting the file's browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the set list. you do not specify the third file; if you have to empty the entry for C, the analysis of the differences is performed with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">About the knob folder... you can also select a folder. if you choose a folder, the comparison will be selected, for B and C, however a folder, then used & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If compiled, the input field is active for destination and can edit. however, it is not necessarily required to immediately specify a output file. you can also get this step later on the storing.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set-up button will open a dialogue with settings. here you can set the options before you start using the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to draw text parts from the clipboard window. the comparison begins then immediately. in opening-dialogue you have to select no files, you can close the dialog easily with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and insert points: simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall over a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which thought is behind it? sometimes, a file contains like many similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, this would be a relatively big effort. you would have to compare only two appropriate files, they are in & kdiff3; download and then compare it. now, you can simply copy the relevant sections, and then compare.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: right now you cannot draw anything out & nondiffusion: just draw the case of text into a comparative window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and insert text into another program than cutting and inserting (instead of copying and pasting). in such cases, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window, the info line contains the characters A, B or C, the file names and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that windows C is optional). (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse a while on the line. then a small guide window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three clusters are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed over the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is recognized, one sees at the colour which file is different. if both files differ, the default colour is different for it. (colour for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files. that's in the next section (merge) well.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Left beside the text is the summary column. if differences were found, the column shows the appropriate colour. in some programming languages, where white signs are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (with C / C + +, for example, white signs are relevant only in character chains and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few, rare single cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that separates the summary column of the text is interrupted by places where the respective source file has no lines. when the row clockout is activated, the line is dotted in its routed line.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (under the synonymous star) also has an info line with the wording edition:, the filenames and [changed] when you edited the result. usually, it includes the automatic merge already text, but often it includes conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts arise, the storks disables!!! (use the buttons for the next stem / unsolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparative patterns are used, each difference is also to be solved at the same time a conflict of manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows that marks the line of belonging group in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed. (this will also be a jump of position within the windows that the beginning of the group would not be visible.) This group is highlighted when the color color is highlighted above, and each on the left appears a black beam.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes the automatic assembling or by manual work no further line exists in the group; then there will be a space for the event that you change your opinion, and perhaps choose another source. this text appears either in the final file, nor in a marker that you might want to copy and elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge concepts; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. go carefully with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if selecting the sources the options apply or ignorant C / C + + comments are activated, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the image and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard on the left, right, high, runter, page from, beginning, end, strag-start and shrubs, siw like you can also use it from other programs. the Oversiles column next to the vertical image bar can also be used to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the Aug.efenster you can also use the other buttons for operation. with the paste button, you can switch between the insert and overclocking mode. (default is the one-option mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the summarizing columns, synchronizes the view of all windows to the start of each group (as already in the section) and the editable outputscore was explained in the section).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Strg-down upward) or to the next / previous conflict (Strg-Image Abroad) or to the next / previous conflict. therefore, all non-resolved conflicts continue to be regarded as a conflict. therefore, between deleted and unskilled conflicts must be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the markings into the clipboard, you have to copy the Copy button (Strg-C or Strg paste). if this option is, you'll automatically copy the clipboard automatically and copy the manual copying. be careful with this option but you might be able to override the content of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Newrow are stored in accordance with the underlying OS. Unix-variants use a row pre-dip character\, and Win32-based systems use Wagenaudckles\\ r\. Kdiff3 retains the line-end of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not with binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the most recently used files will automatically be saved and restored in the next start. (menu objection - &gt; Kdiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also displays scripts with variabler width to choose from, you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences in short-term scriptures are shown. if the chosen script does not support this account, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in its pure form, but would be put forward. on these systems the knobate presets automatically puts an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is activated, the gaps of the Tabulator button is inserted the appropriate number of spaces. otherwise, a tabulator character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When entering or return, the entry of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each selection will automatically be copied to the clipboard. copy the manual to the clipboard falls into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select the line type you prefer to save. the default value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">At the comparing of files tried & kdiff3; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step can be ignored by white signs. the second step compares each line. in this step, white signs are not ignored. in this step, white signs will not be ignored. even when together, white signs will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a chariot pre-sign '\\ r' and a newline character '\' at the end of a line, but then you could modify files with different sizes on page-side comparison, however, like a white sign is treated. during which, this option must be disabled. in the default, this option has to be deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and related characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') ignored. in the result, the differences are still indicated, but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In the default, this option is deactivated. changes in comments are treated like changes in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensively searching for even smaller differences. the option is activated in preference. it is effectively at complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the Automatisch mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next unresolved conflicts will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Does not solve automatic all conflicts in white signs by selecting the selected file as a source. (default, manual selection.) That differs from time to time. please note that the automatic selection also concerns conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignorant C / C + + -comments are activated.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are dealt with in the chapter of Scannen by folders and announcing a consolidation. look for details under the documentation concerning the directory comparison and execution.</seg>
<seg id="2337">When a file is stored and already an older version exists, the original version does the Suffix .orously attached. if already such a backpack file exists with the Suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Fits the language of the user interface. you do not need to end the current ongoing program. you have to end & kdiff3; finish and restart so that the change is active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set up globally over the control centre).</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following cogeneration settings can be set for each entry separately. if you activate this option, it will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection field for coding is a short notice which is the local coding. (this can not change here and has for you purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file coding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. as the coding is adjustable to each file individually, even files with different encoding can be compared and combined.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have finished a file, you can specify which code to save is to be used.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing command, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files may be 16-bit Unicode, but the processing command can only be with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option one can specify the coding of the output processing command.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to lower highlighting of changes in white signs in the text or overviews. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignorant C / C + + -comments are activated.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a Colorful banded column, but sometimes you might just want to see the differences between two of three files. -gt; B, A & lt; -gt; C is displayed in addition to the normal still a second oversired column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the space available on the screen rather for long lines. simply use the less important window. (this option is in the window-menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Specify the one side next to each other or to each other. this can also be useful to display long lines. (this option is in the window-menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you see the differences and then you decide to bring the files together. up-to-date file will work together when you only compare two files. a simple click starts the conduction and use the filename of the last source file as default for the output file. (if this function is used to merge again, then the name of the most recently used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first transferred to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command becomes visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor, which corresponds exactly your requirements. you can use this function for example, cut bobsessive sections or to correct the rectification.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is stated first to this external command (see above), then the output of the command is used only when the row command processor command. you can write your own preprocessor, which corresponds exactly your requirements. each entry line must have an associated issue line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The thought behind it is to allow the user more flexibility when placing diff results. however, an external program requires, and most users who do not want to program themselves. however, the good news is, however, that in most cases are sed sed or perl.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for newrow to transform the input into big letters: sed's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 / 'The\\ 1 in the creation string refers to the found text in the first Klammera few. the\\ U turn the found text in large letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some key words to insert a string text (info: / cvs / Keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $key word\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\.\\ before the $is needed because $a special sign is and the end of the line would mean.</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you might start to understand and perhaps you may even think these regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignoring of numbers is actually an already built-in function in Kdiff3. but it's good as an example for a further processing command for newenabusi.sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and every hit is replaced by nothing, so virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to perform several realizations at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' use to separate the realizations of each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed sed you can also use something different as such as perl. perl -p -s / REGEXP / replacement / switches' allerdings are in perl some details different. where sed\\ (and\\) needs perl only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after normal preprocessor will be retained for viewing and coming together. further operations are only the data that sees the line-number algorythm.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Please note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the line number sees the version of normal preprocessor.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function, the text changes or differences hidden, you cannot notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers must edit many files in a folder. for this reason you can compare with & kdiff3; complete folder reitalic compared and merge together.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes every object a proposal to bring together; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate that and shows the simulated changes without making them really perform,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... takes selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is similar to the comparisons and execute single files very similarly. you only have to specify a folder on the Command Line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folder will be assembled, folder 1 is used as a base. if no target specified was specified, used & kdiff3; folder 3 as target-folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, do not merge the merge, you need to select the appropriate menu item or press the F7 button. (more details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder you will inform you of a small news window about the current progress. if you break the scanning of the folder, only the files are listed until then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the scanning of the folder is complete, displays & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Any file and each folder of the scan was found here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure will usually be folded together. you can click on the + / - click on the object, or using the arrow buttons for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions all subdirectories, and all subdirectories that you can stream all the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you click on a file, the file-comparison will start and it appears a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the connections will not be automatically selected. if that's running, you will be informed about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the above image, are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">However, with identical entries, the color is also identical, even if the age of the items is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical. then, folder is the same color. with folders, age is irrelevant for its colour.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea to this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaflet, which is only green, then yellow will and later, when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if a folder and B is a file): error: contradictory file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, this can not be launched.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if a folder and B is a file): error: contradictory file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, this can not be launched.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode to synchronize is active if only two folder and no explicit target specified were specified, and if the option directories are synchronised, and then select & kdiff3; the necessary action to ensure that both folder are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as the visible filename for the output file only B; right after the merge copied & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are assembled and the option rediffers instead of moderation (uncertain) enabled, then a error message: files are different, but the exact date is identical, but the exact date is identical.. solange such errors are not eliminated, that's the merge the folder can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the collapse, a file will be processed after the other. she's status column shows Fertig when the collapse was successful, and according to other messages, when something unexpectedly emerged, you ought to reproduce a last review and see if the status is fine throughout.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the intersection the file method is selected, Kdiff3 other columns will display. these contain the number of unsolved, solitary, non-whitish and whitish conflicts. (the column for deleted conflicts is only displayed when three folder is compared or together.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or Odner), or all entries in one time. if you have selected all the connections to each other (also in all subfolders), you can merge this.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not specified a target folder, then in the three-folder mode C, it will be used as the target, in the two-folder game, B is chosen as a destination and will be synchronize A and / or B as a destination.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target audience, please check if all entries should be displayed in the target room, also in folder structure. check out these options to avoid unsettish surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To bring all entries together: select filing in the directory menu or press F7 (the keystrob). to bring only the current entry: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If through conflicting data types still incomplete actions exist, a message appears to be displayed on the faulty elements. you can then select a valid action then.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you merge all entries, a dialogue window appears with the options lead, simulate and aborting.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Pick the simulate if you would like to see what is going to happen without the real changes. you will then get an extensive list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then execute specific actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a cracking window will open (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, select again or press folders or press F7. if you have not yet saved, a corresponding dialog appears. then leads & kdiff3; his work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; to make a mistake that appears a message and detailed status information. at the end of the list you see some troubleshooting. if you decide to try it again, or to skip the problematic item. so you have the option to select another action to the entry or to solve the problem in other ways before going on with the collapse.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were individually assembled, you notice & kdiff3; these items (in current session) and performs them at the later date of all entries or not saved, these entries are considered settled. only if you change the assembled action, these entries are again guided again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu settings - &gt; Kdiff3 to direct...) now has a section called register-merger with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that suit the stated pattern will be displayed in the elementary tree. you can separate the patterns with a semicolon; valid preference: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not correspond to this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders correspond to this pattern, are not displayed in the elementary tree; use the semicolon; as separator: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders correspond to this pattern, are not displayed in the elementary tree; use the semicolon; as separator: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would be ignored by CVS. many autonomous files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this folder is specific to a .cvsignal file. (look under info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystem files, files contain a comparative attribute. in other filesystem you are marked a preceding point. this option makes you decide if these files are to be displayed in the elementary tree, or not. this option is enabled in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When links to files: if the option is switched, symbolic shortcuts is compared. if the option is switched, the files are compared to which the links show. this is deactivated in preference.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When links to folder: if the option is switched, the links how regular folder will be treated and recursively searches. (note that & kdiff3; not to possible record highs), links to a folder of a link on yourself would lead to a final loop and & kdiff3; crashes away.) This option is placed in the default notation.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Introduces a complete analysis of each file by and shows the statistics columns. (the number of dissolved, unsolved, non- and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when it is applied to files which do not contain text. (enter a written anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare big folder via a slow network, it is likely to compare the change date and the file size. however, this speed advantage does not cost you a certain level of security. please use caution. this option is unfolded in preference.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to trust the change date. there is no real comparison place. the files are considered identical if they are identical. this can be useful for example when copying the amendment has been lost. please use caution. this option is unfolded in preference.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Enabled the synchronise mode when two folder is compared and no target specified was specified. in this mode, the proposals are assembled, so that both the folder are identical. also, the results of the merge files are stored in both folders. this option is placed in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences will be held instead of the copying of the newer file as an action. (this will be considered uncertain, because it is assumed that the other file does not change too.) This option is placed in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or a folder is replaced by another or deleted, the original version is renamed and gets deleted. if an old backup file with the .orc extension has already existed, this will also affect normal connections, not just the combined folder. this option is switched on the default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the steer-merge view tends to move along individual files; you can switch to the Fenghertlers with the mouse. if you don't want this, you can switch the folder & text window to switch the main window in the window menu and switch through change between directory & text window between the two views switch.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file using a double-click menu. nevertheless, there is also a corresponding menu entry. you can install a single file also directly, without the folder, the status will be reset and the file will not revert when you start the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost though, if you read the directory again: list -menu: new read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supported network transparent with the help of KIO slaves. Kdiff3 uses this to read files and folders. this allows you to specify files and folders for opening up on local or remote machines.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on a ftp-server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax to be a local files and a folder. some things should be observed:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path may be relative rounded or.. included. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masc. (# - &gt;% 23, spaces &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. there is a brief list of constraints:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished if a link to a file or a folder. then a file is accepted as a link destination. (FTP:, ftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to process authorations or change of change. therefore, the authorations or modification date from the original date. (consider the option to trust the size.) (this is possible only with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of reference is currently the differences in KDevelop. KDevelop starts with the built-in differences in KDevelop. KDevelop starts with the right mouse button on the differences and then select In Kdiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually required & kdiff3; two complete input files. if it is used as KPart, & kdiff3; the names of the original files in the Unified format. then entail & kdiff3; the names of the original files from the patch file. then start & kdiff3; the program Patch launches the missing file to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - Kdiff3Part. besides, this does not work if any of its original files does not exist. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have been changing since the patch of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports the comparing of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. this combined or the comparison of folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiff2 (now it is compressed) there are already. furthermore, the name Kdiff3 already indicates that it may bring together as the program diffuse 3 from the Diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I've learned a lot of GPL-programs for a long time and have learned a lot by reading into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this path or have to go.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You've probably not compiled the program from the sources and configure the configure command to KDE. in the default configure in / usr / local, but then KDE can not find resources for the user interface (e. g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white signs differ slightly, these lines will be treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line is considered not identical. if similar lines are next to each other, this is the same but this item is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor will remember every difference in the files where it begins and where it ends. this is needed to solve a conflict simply by clicking on the source code and selecting the button A / B / C, however, it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this has so far been too large. you can restore a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C. to process larger quantities of text should be used by another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; No src is defeated; published and the text cannot be deleted. what does that mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses many colors for protruding of differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and lacking the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and troubleshooting came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web. thanks!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you may need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use Kdeck3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You will find a list of recent changes under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / changelog or in the Changelog file.</seg>
<seg id="2441">Um & kdiff3; on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir prints the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automake use, you should have no problems with compiling. should nevertheless difficulties occur, please report on the & kde; -mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut (Strg-X or Switchalt-removal) copied to the clipboard and deletes the marked text. paste the text from the clipboard to the current Current position and replaces the current market position.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show differences: files the same as all folders are not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the target-folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current version you must update about changes to these options the folder with the function Updating new insights.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries to display the differences. this also performs that identical files will not be copied in the target folder. if the target-folder, these files will not already exist, they are missing after that. (the behavior will probably be amended in a later program version.) This option is switched in the default version.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons for selecting the source using the signment A, B and C below the menu bar. if you are attached to one of the buttons, the lines are attached to the close window at the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present), they are removed by clicking on the button below.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In preference, this option is deactivated. underground differences in individual signs (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; shows a miniature of all virtual workspaces. it is quite handy to see the ongoing programs on the desktop to change its size, stop or shift it. this works both within a desktop and for several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; it can display all virtual workspaces plus the applications running in it. the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button you can create windows within & kpager; the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other desktop areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on: when on the empty background of & kager, then the context menu has inserted only the two entries... and end. if however on an application within & kpager, it also appears on the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimizing, maximize, on desktop and end. the commands effect the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window on the full size of the desktop. appears only when applied to an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Send the application to select virtual desktop. appears only when applied to an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this cross field is marked, windows can be moved inside the & kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also shifted to other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is crossed, are in & kpager; the names of the virtual desktop are shown.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Ankreuzen this field leaves the & kpager; displaying the numbers of virtual workspaces. is it together with name show, the names are provided with ordinal-, eg; 1. working space.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is crossed, the background of each desktop is also shown as background in the background.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is crossed, the current programs are displayed as a small window in the & kpager; otherwise, others will only be shown the empty desktop to make their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. symbol shows the windows with its basic symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. remark: Pixmap is recommended only for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & kpager can be determined: classically leaves & kpager; in a 2xn reaster appear, like out of Pager applications in some other windowels; waagrecht shows all virtual workspaces in a horizontal series, which is very good for the representation on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager; it can be used as an alternative to the Pager miniature program in the checkbox. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, view the windows as symbols or with their content. besides, it runs outside the checkbox.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click on the right mouse button within & kpager; and subsequent acquisition of switchers... lets the dialog settings appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment, this cannot change in dialogue settings, but you can do this manually:</seg>

<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; may cause the pain by clicking the mouse and thus helps to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may also suffer from the mere loading of the mouse. suffer from pain that are associated with using your computer, you should look up a doctor if this has not yet been done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it happen once again: even though & kmousetool; pain also helps with clicking with the mouse, it's against pain, which are caused by the loading of the mouse, useless. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result can vary for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse motions and introduces a mouse click as soon as you break the motion short.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the smart relocating system makes & kmousetool; a break after it takes the pressing the mouse button. move the mouse run by mouse button. in this way you can execute the pulling with pressing mouse button. this smart moving requires a little practice, but you get used to get rid of it quickly.</seg>

<seg id="2509">The best use & kmousetool; first of all with the presets. especially the smart relocating should you be switched at first. if you then hit the automatic mouse click, you can later push the smart relocating.</seg>
<seg id="2510">When you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce the response times from & kde; to decrease in sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of what places a mouse-click without effect remains: the click on the neutral components of windows or on positions in the browser window which does not represent a link, does not cause uncertain reactions. you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse ruckelt, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is that you will not only clean the mouse but also the roles that come with the mouse ball in touch.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you have to remove the mouse hemisphere. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different. but it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the roles. these are located on the sides of the hole, used to the ball. the dirt and dirt can easily be used with a flat blade or the Fingernagel abkratzen.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system breaks the execution of & kmousetool; if just a reference finish started. if you are in this case the smart relocating means, that's that & kmousetool means that the surgery cannot finish more by clicking the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you are using & kmousetool; using another window manager and postpone a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you perform yourself a mouse click. in this case, the status of & kmousetool is reset and you can continue as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you type in text, try & kmousetool; to run mouse clicks and put the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to place where you want to have it. however, you can no longer manage the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop, if you do not encounter the mouse on a neutral button. safe zones for the mouse-cursor are & eg; the gray area around the toolbar and menus and the titles of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent connection, but I don't manage to edit the text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart moving is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very well possible to copy text in the clipboard, or want to insert it in the clipboard, while selecting the mouse with pressing mouse button. but there will probably be some advice to them:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart relocating process if you just start using & kmousetool; select text instead, and keep the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse-cursor to the other end of the text and move again the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. thus, everytime when & kmousetool; the mouse is pressing a sound like a mouse click. later, you can use the smart moving also without the audible mouse click. but in addition, it requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; you have to be the XTest-extension for & X Window; installed in most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system features a sound card and speakers and it is correctly furnished.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; attainted the mouse-cursor as soon as the mouse-cursor. this program was developed for people who suffer the RSI syndrome and which the actuality of the mest pain is causing.</seg>

<seg id="2622">To understand the functioning of filtering, it is important to know how the program "Speech Dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; differs four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of Screen Reaars has the highest priority. it will be dragged to all other orders and maintains this orders. if the output of screen reader is pre-read, the stopped orders will be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is going to be hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are continued after issuing the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the nearest top priority. a message leaves normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application to read the messages. while you & eg; a long text on a website can be read, you can go with & kmouth; someone you just enter the room. & kde; notifications are also news. read on this.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order that you encounter from the map card is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that are used text messages. text messages are intended for the issue some texts that have no particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in waiting-long, with the exception of the output of Screen Readers. if an application is sent the output of a screen file, during & kton; just one such preread, this issue will be stopped and ended.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen refunds. you will be applied to normal warnings, messages and text messages as well as on & kde; -news.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are executed as modules. in future, there can still be more kinds of filters.</seg>

<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology, in the second, all of & knetworkconf; changeable configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section can not replace knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information on the integration of PCs will be conveyed into a small (home -) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP Version 4 (IPv5). IPv5 has never seen large spread. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future. this description is currently focused on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is aware of which IP-address of a network interface is available. in foreign networks, on & eg; the workplace is the contact point, which is a valid IP address or, if available, the IP address can not be used simply any number!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a private little (home) network, IP address should be chosen from a specially for this purpose in order to avoid IP address accounts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, so its use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the internet for such machines can be achieved by setting up an gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, mostly addresses are used in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is big enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the network mask is usually set on 255.255.255.0 so that all machines are in the same sub-network.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0g; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first one is the so-called Standard Route, the Zweite the loopback address (localhost = the own computer). the standard route is required for the IP-transmission.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The power-address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP-traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to its own so-called loopback interface, which works as a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, the configuration files are affected by & knetworkconf; and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed at DSL-connections, so that it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections to find another content than defined there.</seg>

<seg id="2942">In addition, we also allows for example to provide information about problems related to information about problems that may occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore tries to provide some advanced functions, using their help the protocol files to certain programs are filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has a number of useful features, including a number of useful features. among other things include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, with their help the individual protocol-lines of a log file will easily filter and sort. the individual possibilities for the sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start tries to open & ksystem log; first of all, the main protocol-file of the system - to open the system protocol. it is probably not displayed with system configurations. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the folder / var / log, for the normal users usually no justification for reading.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the fileline in order to filter for a fixed criteria or by filtering character. the list of log files will now be displayed, so that only a log box is displayed in next to the filter. then a protocol-line will only be shown if in one of the columns the string of the filter is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry on this site. for example in the log file system, select the column process and enter the filter timeline the name of a process, so shows you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to see the important protocol lines. protocol lines of stage error will be displayed with a conspicuous color as a protocol-line of stage indicator. the colored presentation of protocol lines can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you only want to show certain process (for example in the system protocol or on the cron protocol), you can use the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can then be useful if you would like to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the samba server. in this case use filterbox.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can skip the option to translate new lines in the context menu of the main window, in order to display all the new add-line lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows the display of multiple protocol files into separate subwindows. to use this function, use the entries in the menu window to open up additional sub-window and administer. once you selected a subwindow, select a protocol to display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own web page on http: / / ksystem log.forum-software.org. Dort you will find further up-to-date information about the supply sources of & ksystemlog;</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you will also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion Archives: ksystemlog; im & kde; -archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & kde; system V init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv;. this section introduces a few concepts one and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V init develops quickly to the standard for controlling the program start at the top of the system in the & Linux; and this is because it is easier to use, powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD incite.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further on historical aspects here (e.g. because I do not know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file lies under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to put a machine on system V, without a reinstallation and re-format. that's why you need to make sure that the old init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV init also differs from BSD init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc, instead of / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for each system service that you want to start running the system or when switching to a different running system. system services include such things like networks, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such stuff as settra, which will only be started. such views are named after rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be in turn on / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even though it does not have much use for it. you can also let a rc.se in / etc / rc.d if you want to run something to do with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches for various locations after the program init and starts the first one you find.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / initty. you should see in the initial area a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look into the second column and probably discover that the default runway 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can perform / etc / inittle from hand and change the 3. be very careful when you go to inittating modifications. if you have something to go through, then you will fix it by reboot the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it all start the correct scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you will probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder there are no real files. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">As starts and stop init actually system services? very simple: each of the scripts is so written that it is an argument as start and stop. you can actually start this script from hand at the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would hold the httpd server. init reads the name, and when a K includes, the script is called with the argument stop. if it includes an S, the script is called with the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; one server -Runoff, which can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc., moreover, I could also have a user -Runoff, which & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; you should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or other pochargeable device is simple to not say trivial, simply drag an entry from the area of the availability system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can change script also between Runleveln or change the position within a level by moving it elsewhere. thereby, the entry is removed from its original runlevel (or its position). this will only happen if it will draw an entry in the area of the availability system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are delayed when you drag them into a new section. to copy them on a new running level, you must explicitly select copying out of the menu item or paste the context menu, even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the promotion.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorrow of a item can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting entries of the surrounding entries, before you can once again try to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to reproduce items that have been thrown in the trash. therefore, be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tabulator key to activate the different workspaces (Available Systemservices, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To postpone entry into another running level, move it with out into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X use) and add it into the desired running level with inserting (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorrow numbers or the name of an entry manually, press the input button to switch the Properties dialog. use the Tabulator button to accept the dialog box, in order to accept the changes, or press Esc to throw the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the danger of data loss, all entries in the menu file require a confirmation, before they are running.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings will be stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets will be taken to the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc). otherwise they are operated by & ksysv; restored. changes to the presets are stored in a local sysysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard Runleveln and now the machine starts in-resistant new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Type LILO -Prompt linux single one and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel at a reasonable value (3 should normally be ok).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; designed to execute under Runlevel X, but they will not be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) then you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual for distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way, how system services are launched in these distributions, however, simplified the configuration for the proprietary uniqueness of this distributions but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you use any other distribution: please check if all configuration files are available (and whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply end without notice if its configuration files are not available or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the running level so that this manual can be added.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation by & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Once you made modifications, you have to store this. either use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or the entry Save in the menu file.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is an easy application. the main window consists of two card cards, the user and user group. to update, select the desired user or the desired group with a double-click on the entry. it appears the dialog user and group features.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some card cards are shown only if you have enabled extended system settings. only if you have a limited time limits (Quota) for users, a cardboard card will be able to make use of individual configuration. further boxes may appear, if shadow -passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd as installed in BSD / Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card menu password appears, if Shadow - passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd as installed in BSD / Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This map-map appears only if for at least one built-out filesystem (Quota) is enabled and initialized (recognizable to the file quota.user / quota.group on the filesystem). here you can change for each user parameters, with the limited number of data in the KB are:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be individually adjusted for any file system. the current file system is selected with the help of the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The map-map Groups informs about the group members of the selected user. the standard group, to which the user is heard, can be found in the field group. furthermore, the user can count in other groups by marking them in the big field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog features of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, highlight this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the menu users or group or click the matching Add-button of the toolbar. to edit or delete the selected user or select group analogue.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO-boot manager to remove the boot password, remove and change the time until the boot of the standard operating system, remove, change operating systems, change, change, and more.</seg>
