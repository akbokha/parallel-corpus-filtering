although I had visited the US at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love of America is extremely great .
as many of my generation I grew up with American films , American music was d@@ anced , American authors read and operated his sport .
in fact this country had a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American movie journalist .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , who was covered with the help of Julia &apos;s Roberts as Jura @-@ Stud@@ entin , who had the most important federal court with judges which had received its interest .
I was caught .
free to Meth@@ od Man , &quot; I was it , as if that is the absolute truth , certainly everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , had only reinforced my admir@@ ation for the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I always said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting you can always be that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I even had a very well @-@ heart@@ ed love of his size .
then came Donald Tr@@ ump .
much was written about the xen@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most remarkable aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me , how he gets around with his bot@@ t@@ iness .
he never keeps in his mind behind the mountain as it says so beautiful .
he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague it expresses , and declar@@ es publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ ino , Af@@ ro@@ west and women .
nevertheless people have responded to his statements and voted to him for him .
the 13 million votes he won with the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number that had ever achieved by the nomin@@ ee candidate .
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ zy person , I asked myself ?
I could not get Tr@@ ump and his voters no line with people that I met during my time in Phoenix .
as for example my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme , the people from all over the world took , a deeply unbeliev@@ ing person with whom I was talking about Islam and his past .
also tun@@ ed Tr@@ umps &apos;s view was not in line with the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; from the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix One &quot; at the game .
m@@ umps is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity that I lived in Sandy B@@ ahr , who fought their lives long , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she adap@@ ts to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ l , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace , and helped me to get used to the complexity of American life .
then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot with my career .
these people and those through them em@@ bo@@ died my love for America .
while tr@@ ump his path to nomin@@ ate Republi@@ can candidate , sent me a grip and the counter@@ part of his limited vision of America .
but it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps precisely because of its cont@@ emp@@ t to non @-@ white people .
the debate with the idea that people voted for tr@@ ump because they had either shared its racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were prepared to over@@ look these things , I broke almost the heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the tr@@ ump voters as a rac@@ ist .
to as@@ sign the people , one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and respectful and indicates a in@@ capability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows the people that their concerns and fears are not taken into account of the hec@@ tic changes in their communities .
could it be that this voters no longer voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that does not dis@@ ap@@ point it ?
in other words , they might want to say that in this America they are still important ?
maybe .
however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who have commented the cru@@ el decision to raise a man who looks different with respect to those who look different from him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( an@@ m . ) : so much like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drawing up the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ nic@@ ities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the White and wh@@ i@@ pl@@ ash , which means as it was the great Van Jones , just killed what America has done so magnificent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the globe appreciate American ideal - no matter whether the myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever faith or background one may always have , America is everyone welcomed .
for this country chose his president , twice the son of Ken@@ ian@@ ers , whose story , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , with the election Donald Tr@@ umps , there is a huge part of the white Americas in this promise , saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again in the ruin , say they say .
with all of this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who died in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a r@@ ally for Hill@@ ary Clinton had a word@@ change with the crowd .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the amount answered with a sound@@ ly &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; ro@@ le@@ ed the amount .
&quot; have Lat@@ ino a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; I answered them .
have A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they called her and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received a vote and a strong &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
Mr. Khan closed in words : &quot; God be praised that Mr. Tr@@ ump is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country , for which his son was fallen , he sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ umps , said the message .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could not find no place in this new America .
and this is cr@@ ashing my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero municipality in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean town Cat@@ e@@ ura ?
that music , which is played in both places , not only the lives of children , but also a very close connection with ...
music , which lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a great gar@@ bage dump , only 16 kilometres south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; an old colonial city , which is very popular among tourists but far from the nearby magnificent ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for some years now the La B@@ anda de m@@ ú@@ sica ( musi@@ c@@ de ) has now been playing in the community : one of the children and adults existing Symph@@ onie @-@ Orchestra , which has found a way to overcome poverty with their music instruments .
a music @-@ school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , located in one of the poorest provinces of Mex@@ ik@@ os , is known for its drugs mis@@ use and banking violence .
but , after a random encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project and the youth had such a rare hop@@ eless@@ ness .
the young band members take their commitments to the music @-@ group very seriously , means the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty roads to follow their great passion .
they always come laugh@@ ing with sh@@ iny eye and playing in the excitement you will learn day for Day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , ob@@ oe , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga .
music from Mül@@ l@@ gar@@ bage
more than 7,@@ 000 kilometers south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village that is practically up on the biggest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay capital - on instruments produced from re@@ ver@@ wert@@ ely waste material :
music with re @-@ prepared instruments that consist of local solid waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for music instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura where the rec@@ ycl@@ er led by F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ ávez in order to transform parts of waste in instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , C@@ elli , double @-@ bass , gu@@ it@@ ars , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , which were all made out of the gar@@ bage .
the re@@ pertoire consists of classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article from Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ ávez , a local econom@@ ist and musician instructor the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , at the first time :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach in the same place where the parents worked in the gar@@ bage , The children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents , because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed as a tr@@ avi@@ o , something that he never had seen before : one made from waste her@@ ed in violin .
today there is an entire orchestra that plays on instruments produced and which called The Rec@@ ycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) draws the musical performance at :
the world generates around one billion tonnes of waste each year .
those who live with him and of him are the poorest people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here it turned him into something beautiful .
land@@ fill harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational spectac@@ le of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra has played his music even before the Pope :
these East African countries show how technology and team work can fight on illegal fishing
photo © FISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fighting illeg@@ itim@@ ate fish@@ eries .
this article , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , published a magazine that deliber@@ ates on international , practic@@ ing solutions for environmental problems .
the rep@@ ub@@ lication is done as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the common use of content .
in West Africa , at the time that this ship was already operated in liberal waters of illegal fishing , before it was the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were so accordingly raised and little incl@@ ined to welcome a hur@@ t@@ wister of this species to their shores .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the com@@ ers , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles mobil@@ ised himself quickly against the ship . they refuse to b@@ apti@@ ze one of its har@@ b@@ ours and also refuse to give him a fisher@@ man permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that would simply refuse to refuse anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ members Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leader of the Ken@@ yan Fish@@ eries Agency . he is part of a team that discovered and followed the ship itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region ; it was not succeeded to catch fish there .
finally , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to liber@@ ia due to pill@@ age of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , the criminal practices un@@ crossed and resources , FISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO stop illeg@@ ally stopped ( Il@@ leg@@ ale fish@@ eries ) .
the members of this network are next to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries which had driven out the prime minister of their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries which are equal and working together . they exchange information and stand up each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , leader of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts project ending illeg@@ ally F@@ ishing . this project offers FISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , present because it is extremely difficult to pick up there . thus , the illegal fishing is a leading cause of the over@@ fishing of regions .
by int@@ enti@@ onal ab@@ cont@@ emp@@ t of existing laws , through which certain habitats and types are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems can harm that del@@ ik@@ ates balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were ham@@ pered by bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ dles and also cur@@ ated by the sn@@ ail , so doing events today in real time , with trac@@ eable on FISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
here , the individual countries can interact with each other for lists of existing licenses , news about suspected activities or details that you noticed or experienced during a harbor spec@@ tion .
Fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea , using satellite data .
this allows the authorities to mark ships who fish in for@@ b@@ lowing areas - some such that point out that a ship loads its dom@@ est@@ icated fish on the road on other ships .
ideally , such surveys may show whether the ships have a fish licence , where they were on the road and possibly also , whether they have a crime .
countries that are against illegal fishing , may refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports . what means that ships could not sell their cargo in their ports . and that they could even be forced to the numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then about significant financial losses for the owner , which means that the illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , Chief Director of NF@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant @-@ company that advoc@@ ates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also being assisted in the FISH # .
a closed front
the aforementioned platform was created to win estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover , who lost the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i each year due to illegal fishermen who penet@@ rate the East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishing , present for the region commercial fishing trade from all over the world . among these also one @-@ seven illegal fishermen .
among other practices other actions count as the sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit licens@@ ing , st@@ ating patterns , fish @-@ protected species and the fish in nature areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they target@@ ing the lack of international co @-@ operation and make themselves the weaknesses of a un@@ brid@@ ged control system &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier , a ship could have illegal fishing and a country could then say &quot; you dar@@ ed my harbor not to run &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &apos; com@@ m to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ as@@ l tries to connect to the FISH # . &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to now the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , FISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ ects ships .
it has un@@ covered networks rag@@ ing that were distributed counter@@ f@@ eit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent ident@@ ities and found it found and found .
due to its cooperation with Inter@@ pol , the International Authority on fighting crime , FISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances and preserved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our studies are leading us rather far into the networks organized crime &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that should help FISH @-@ i double @-@ di@@ ct ships to be carried out .

Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always further developed , will also help to hide the illegal ships who would like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g Mat Tr@@ acking , a N@@ RO , which also deals with fish@@ eries data and FISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships switch for example their automatic in@@ denti@@ fication systems , which they can no longer be removed from satellites .
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects different information levels with each other . it &apos;s designed to help shape criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
yet , FISH @-@ i &apos;s team can actually influence African nations on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth is working together with Google and the marine environment Oc@@ e@@ ana , a platform for Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite data and can be viewed by means of which the position of each individual trac@@ eable ship can be displayed worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dental with the neighbours to get a better picture of who what is doing - this is just sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a chance for countries to combine and combine their resources to study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should do this on a global level . &quot; the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has to run a similar project in which a global system allows the pursuit of ships .
there are signs that FISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only feel crime , but they can also sc@@ are .
ships that conf@@ isc@@ ated earlier without a license and hardly to reck@@ on with consequences , now know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u some of the countries participating in the FISH @-@ i countries have now a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries set , since fishing boats can buy more licenses .
after having assisted in Somalia , Gre@@ ko 1 found 1 doors , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tow , whose use is prohibited .

&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a degree of study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , 2015 six countries have joined together , so called West Africa Task Force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are now fighting the illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as the FISH # . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with security , the goal is to generate more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , FISH @-@ i &apos;s recent member states could report of his first big tri@@ umph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was released under false flag - and not only was the ship without a license and were used to mount netz@@ e that are now banned by now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also included in har@@ dened waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with taking thousands of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for FISH @-@ i this is a further success of many . and at the same time evidence that such a particular , collabor@@ ative approach to protect the oceans actually works in the whole world ocean . Emma Br@@ yce is fre@@ el@@ ance and lives in London . she writes them on the subject of environment , technology and nutrition .
their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , The New York Times and The Guardian . situation in Venezuela is now step@@ ping to : demonstrations in several cities with the aim to reg@@ ain the country &quot;
the street mot@@ ions in Venezuela appears to be only the beginning of a wave of fier@@ ce demonstrations .
they are regarded as a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government of the opposition had rejected the application of the opposition to a referendum on Am@@ t@@ sen@@ so , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans held the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country in the country by meeting the streets of the streets .
under the has@@ ht@@ ag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the return of the Venezu@@ el@@ ment ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them .
the debate is also managed in other parts of the country - among other things in the bay of Bar@@ inas , in the Andes @-@ regions of Méri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , at the central flag@@ ship of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o , and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the federal state Nu@@ eva Esp@@ arta .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation is steadily deteri@@ or@@ ated in a continuous manner , which makes it more noticeable in the everyday life of the Vene@@ ti@@ ans through an acute lack of food and medicine .
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the Am@@ t@@ sen@@ vi@@ val of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance for a fundamental change , but ultimately , the position of re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Marianne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , takes part in the context of the government &apos;s role as follows :
within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , the infl@@ ation@@ ary and ant@@ al@@ tr@@ ate belongs to the highest across the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % of the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine has been considered to give the country the chance to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to close a new governance .
the elec@@ toral b@@ undle M@@ esa de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( approximately : r@@ under table of the Democratic unit ) , the demonstr@@ ators are aligned towards the support of the National Assembly . in addition , a twelve @-@ hour strike is scheduled for the election of 2015 as well as a march to the Miraflores palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government , on November 3 , the block@@ ade of the refer@@ en@@ du@@ ms should continue to continue .
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :

on Twitter , pictures that tell of disputes and reports of repression and abuse .
particularly large waves beat the news of polished oppression in the central @-@ north city of Marac@@ ay .
there , the protest@@ ers went back to the local cathedral , to protect themselves according to the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they could leave the cathedral safely , but the protests went on .
in other parts of the country were tried some demonstr@@ ators , the police forces , including those women in the state of T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not carry hands , because you could see something else , what many nationalities did not have !
meanwhile an inf@@ os already makes an info@@ graphic that forms the scale of oppression per day :
thus , the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had asked the validity of the demand for an approval procedure ; this was now demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the street .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s said :

others do consider these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government , which has undertaken a little against the devast@@ ating economic crisis and would prefer to con@@ front the critical voices of putting critical voices :
they have taken us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches are getting more and more in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media , they were hungry , to participate in a strike , rather than working or shopping .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father the atro@@ city in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentin@@ ean city Córdoba .
in the course of the adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano said now in the framework of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial in the Province of Córdoba to his father .
the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated , which were committed during the Argentin@@ ian military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not look for his life .
starting with the Bür@@ de , the same name as his father to carry up to the brutal military intervention in prison La Per@@ la , he watched at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family environment for himself .
in the situation at that time , I felt that was fine .
I felt like an en@@ viable .
as a child with 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer and mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ eri@@ rial @-@ dec@@ eption from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father from 1976 to 1978 Dep@@ uty Kom@@ man@@ de@@ ur &apos;s sec@@ ur@@ age of 141 in prison La Per@@ la .

no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and who spoke against his own father before a federal court .
his story shows which great power has a par@@ ental over his child , and how this child chose a path of salvation .
from the sport@@ hall to the military base point
when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went with us into the sports hall . I took my friends with a boy , the mar@@ tial arts .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have made you with one of the ERP .
pass only on that they do not escape one day and I must save you .
the ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revolu@@ cion@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - revolution@@ aries of the Liber@@ ties - the military arm of the Revolu@@ tionary Workers &apos; Party of Argentina .
therefore he offered me to go back to the sports hall . some days later he took me with the work on the military base .
he told me , I would be en@@ viable .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok . for this my Father had me educated .
on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all sorts of documents : University closures , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , pro@@ pag@@ and@@ amat@@ erial , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ there , the prisoners are tor@@ tured &quot;
my father took me four times in La Per@@ la , all in 1976 .
during the first and last time he allowed me to wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time he command@@ ed me to get out . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , television , Ref@@ ri@@ ger@@ ators - just everything possible .
all of it was stolen .
he gave me a little in a blan@@ ket sto@@ cked and command@@ ed me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great pl@@ ump of silver .
on this day I went to the other end of the Bar@@ ac@@ ke where the stolen objects were completed and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
there , the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I sp@@ ying into it , and saw a couch , tor@@ tured on man .
it looked like a rotating bed and metal @-@ feathers .
later I found out that they had attached to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the person who was cap@@ tiv@@ ated .
they rarely have a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ shot him with water and hunting him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the pl@@ ank there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirt wind@@ y .
years later , when my father was under house ar@@ rest , the same smell came from his room .
I realized the smell instantly and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I wonder@@ ed : how is it possible that a person can do so much sor@@ row ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I knew that these people were killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were cap@@ tiv@@ ated with handic@@ ra@@ fts and eyes .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilians who was also charged in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses , where naked people with the face down - all were cap@@ tiv@@ ated at hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance , people are still lying on the matt@@ resses .
when my father noted that I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; What Are you so , Ar@@ sch@@ loch ? &quot;
I thought , why did you otherwise put down ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my father told her home .
beside La cu@@ ad@@ ra were some rooms that were referred to as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero there was a man coming together and k@@ issed .
( according to information given by survi@@ vor@@ s the civil is Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video Emi@@ lio F@@ essi@@ a , the director of the memorial La Per@@ la , through the old Fol@@ der chambers .
the path on which you came here is also the way on which the kid@@ neys came here .
when you look at the map , see that they took about this path and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names have changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
if they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra till the order from above came that they should be imposed .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shift of men and dis@@ appearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; war@@ be@@ ute &apos;
my dad brought all sorts of stolen things to go home .
back then in the age I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - as they called it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when I was the military by myself , I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war is a bay@@ on@@ ett or perhaps military bad@@ ges that one perc@@ ei@@ ves one enemy that you have fought .

but if one walks into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ table , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not a war @-@ bear@@ er but Vand@@ alism .
this is theft .
I always asked me how my father , the leader of the security forces , could mit@@ ig@@ ate with this destruction .
I simply don &apos;t understand it .
I was also officer at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and me it would never like to penet@@ rate into a house and to ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
once he called me a crimin@@ als and I said , and thou that you have cars on the road ?
you are not crimin@@ als ?
he explo@@ ded before W@@ ut , struck me and cri@@ ed :
if you go so far , then I will find you and bring you on your own hands .
for this we need no other !
so my father was .
I have no only good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo from that time , on which I carried a jacket and a wheelchair @-@ Shirt made of Wol@@ le . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor but he still did clothes with home .
at that time , the defense , a co @-@ con@@ j@@ ure have been at this crime . I resi@@ sted , no problem , they can put me to the burden what they wanted .
I was anyway there , so to speak out .
&apos;@@ The dis@@ appearances of cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel Reu@@ e .
I have children . if one only has children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and realize that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
so , you have gone wrong during the dictatorship of humans . but why the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why children do you live ?
one day my father brought a girl with home , his mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have simply put them into prison .
I guess it was just decided to kill these people . but why their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
had these people not even families of whom they could pass their mort@@ al rem@@ n@@ ants ?
the dis@@ appearance of cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act that can do to a human being .
my father told me when the democracy was introduced again , they gathered machines to eliminate the extinction of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were destroyed and somewhere car@@ ved - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my Father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but something remains always forever .
&apos;@@ I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 crimin@@ als , including my father .
the thought , to view my father , was born during a conversation , when he was under house ar@@ rest .
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly and asked me what the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they said to be defended , actually well .
then finally I cr@@ ying :
how can you tell me what to tell me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have been committed horri@@ ble crimes and you were forced me to participate as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only rep@@ lied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na Then &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is what I did .
2010 I posted the first ad .
I finally had recognized that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can pre@@ di@@ ct that I am bi@@ ased . I finally said against my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in Japanese city Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can pro@@ long a newly opened centre , in the last month of witnesses of a particularly un@@ fortunate translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a shield the Japanese word means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means to be mist@@ aken - possibly also with mal@@ icious back@@ wards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and # 82@@ 12 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fri@@ ght@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was from 1st to 20th of September on electronic advertisement in the entrance area and in the building itself .
processing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine that was often shared in the social media .
the error was the transl@@ ator Julian Hol@@ mes , one of the inhabitants of Ky@@ ot@@ os , and he was also aware of the loc@@ alities .
in Kyoto inter@@ tw@@ ined daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . the design@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henn@@ drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , al@@ beit gram@@ ism not quite correct term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Kyoto ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation errors . furthermore , it stated that the error was already included in the text that they had received from the transl@@ ator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that older people felt thanks to the inadequate correction ( the translation ) of our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News set up a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; fri@@ ght@@ ful &quot; elderly drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ oun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older motor@@ ists . according to the police , the proportion of older motor@@ ists are involved in dis@@ appearances , but definitely cause for concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Kyoto , for example , in 2005 1.@@ 9@@ 41 were caused by a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents of sen@@ iors . this is equivalent to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , estimated sen@@ iors 1,8@@ 03 by a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
in doing so , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents altogether , the proportion of sen@@ iors has risen in the same period of time .
the attri@@ bution not named re@@ porter brought in the published version of Article comments to light that show which prejudi@@ ces were some Japanese apparently for some older drivers :
the article on Yahoo about the translation errors , among other things received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
- &quot; So then the translation is not at all , or ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that this is a real translation mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in all Asia
translation errors are widely used in Japan and in Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true treasure tro@@ ve for this bizarre mistakes in English .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are multi@@ fac@@ eted .
for transfer , one needs two important skills : passive language skills to understand the initial text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language .
the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is in case of native language . in general , the conviction that trans@@ lators are in the target language - not in the language language - mother@@ language should be .
thus a French native language should translate into French example from the English language - not from French into English .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ people who could use English as a mother tongue , translation into English . this may be attri@@ but@@ able to error , reasons , or the relatively small number of English native speakers , the Japanese learning .
some companies that do not have any foreign employees , they release translations of company @-@ internal . then the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge will be considered best to transl@@ ator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
the prescribed and pu@@ zz@@ ling phr@@ ases created by machine translation , show that this technique is not able to replace human trans@@ lators for a long time . this applies to several languages particularly .
some of the rar@@ est English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints , often used T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for st@@ ili@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Joseph Br@@ ent .
trans@@ lators are still acceptable or at least harmless . but of big companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
in the future , the city of Kyoto also makes use of a serious source for its translation .
Venezuela : protests and c@@ ens@@ ur@@ gency to take on the Internet and television
main page of Port@@ als &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ensa y soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institut für Presse und Gesellschaft ) .
on Friday morning , April 7th , the Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users that they have no access to the online radio station Viv@@ op@@ lay .
later other users wrote that the internet pres@@ ences of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV may be no longer accessible .
other on @-@ line radio stations were also organized by protests in Car@@ acas , which were organized by opposition groups organized by the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the protests started at the beginning of April after the upper Court asser@@ ted the parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the upper Court itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er . he pointed out that the connection is k@@ issed , and recommended the users , V@@ PN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet .
# c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your V@@ PN
it seems that Internet site with Venezu@@ el@@ an Provider again is disabled .
this is from the side of @ Viv@@ o@@ Play@@ Net .
offers like Viv@@ op@@ lay has become popular with the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditional media has been in reporting on protests in 2014 . at that time , the Commission for telecommunications to them with money furn@@ aces and lock@@ ings , if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appeal to violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without cable television and informative national TV channels I signed up again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that this continues to be cheaper than two lit@@ ers are to buy le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Viv@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by a block of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online transm@@ itter . this also concerns the website , which the national assembly does over@@ take their meetings .
previous post @-@ for@@ ation of the Institute of Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS use . this is a technique that fails to answer specific domains of specific domains .
if an Internet site is blocked by the DNA , the server respon@@ ds to or refused the request when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNA @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transfer was set on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flores , carried away the protests in Car@@ acas .
Flores was be@@ aten , while he was in police advance .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on show again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the Government is regulated the Internet connections : that is thus the Venezu@@ el@@ ans of access to multi@@ medi@@ al coverage of the current happ@@ en@@ ings in the country is steadily increasing .
in Paraguay , many girls will be slaves to get a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ ad@@ ita as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and colle@@ cts the witnesses of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , who were just as they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the brevi@@ ated version of a report of cur@@ ative , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with friendly permission of the authors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the article is part of a series called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ acas que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que ca@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , edited and released by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household in which they did not work together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the University she returned once again into the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about it . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
that , from which something has become , &quot; she said .
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as cri@@ ad@@ itas , one described in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a big family with little money handed over their short @-@ year son or her baby year old daughter to another , plentiful family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what does not mention here is that the children must do for this countless day work @-@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be raised . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this practice , called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widely used in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by major parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after the completion of her studies Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a couple of years for an organization dedicated to the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - sm@@ iled witnesses , resear@@ ched and p@@ ayed .
she tried to name things in the name , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated to Cri@@ ad@@ itas , guaranteed not to be silent in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is one hand the family who ref@@ rain their daughter in faith that they can close their education , and make their position in society and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make something out of itself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the family is related to the girls and whose exploitation by faith justi@@ fies that they would give someone a chance that otherwise would not get education and perhaps even star@@ ving .
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
if the girl is mis@@ led , his family will only experience many years later .
sometimes they have never experienced them .
in January 2016 , the hi@@ therto relatively un@@ known phenomenon which takes place in hiding in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín at Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú got into hospital , her body showed traces of violent beats . in short , she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former Mil@@ king Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an official office .
Mar@@ ín lived in their house in V@@ aqu@@ ería , a small village with only 3.000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of As@@ unci@@ ón capital .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira proposed a stick to Mar@@ ín as long as they suffered fatal injuries .
this was the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the child was killed a cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organisations such as UNIC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deeply rooted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ian society of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they declared Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest and demanded that &quot; no further co @-@ Carolina &quot; could give in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay are more cows as children , &quot; compl@@ ained Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers , it is much easier to hurt the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbors and nearly 60 civili@@ zed organisations called for a spe@@ edy investigation into the case .
they want the Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was their cri@@ ad@@ ita , sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes before the court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín may be landmark - if for the first time in the story of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is brought to court .
the everyday life of a cri@@ ad@@ ita
Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exploited not only as labour force , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ ners in which her father worked , went bank@@ rupt , and her father lost his work .
their brothers had to all work and began to sell on the street or in the market to sell sweets .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a house worked in the house of her employer between four and six hours every day .
she had to share the time so that you still stayed a lot of time to learn .
she stood up every morning at 5 o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
Friday for example , puri@@ fication them the refrigerator , cleaner the living room , polished the furniture and depos@@ ited the ground .
when the school was ended , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more she was done with learning , the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says , she had to be hungry , but also did not get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord than eating out of the refrigerator , &quot; they remember .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do liberal , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
in some evenings of the hous@@ eholder Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , to stand beside him and read editorial articles from oppos@@ ition@@ ists such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;

and he held it for intelligent , but he did not inter@@ f@@ ere with her . &quot; the landlord had found someone who sp@@ ake , while he spoke of politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; they told me not often to visit my family because they had the opinion that I would be able to learn there &quot; bad habit . &quot; so they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , that belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , at home again her mother@@ tongue Guar@@ an@@ í would speak .
their Lord feared that they had the education they had made it to lose again , she declar@@ es .
but she was totally clear that she was for everything she got of them , who had paid them with their hard work .
also in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a has been discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken , har@@ as@@ sment and the chic@@ ane where Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed , when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parent , is cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I could invite anyone to go home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in time , where friend@@ ships arise , I particularly noticeable that I belonged to no group .

the society endor@@ sed the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group in which to display vac@@ an@@ cies for cleaning personnel and nur@@ ses in Paraguay .
the administrator of the group is PE@@ PA Kost@@ ian@@ ov@@ sky , a city tour in As@@ unci@@ ón District .
hello ! I am looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and afternoon with her .
to learn .
please inform you .
start from Monday , if possible .
the display was awarded five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a three @-@ year girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment has been written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the national inner that wants to work &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the Verf@@ asser@@ t in the ad is once again a :
love Inv@@ est , I have found one . I look , if it works with her .
thank you , I write again , if something is .
the business was complete .
in Pro@@ log to report Cri@@ ad@@ itas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ ad@@ itas , how long still ? ) , a collection of stuff , former Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history we managed to establish systems like slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice at the Spanish conquest , the women of Guar@@ an@@ í had to be subjected to their &quot; wives ) , the women of Guar@@ an@@ í had to establish tri@@ bute to their &quot; wives , &quot; that many girls and boys go into a system of slavery with which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
social inequality in Paraguay and on the vision of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
legislative design writes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

&quot; &quot; &quot; six@@ ty Egyptian parliamentary groups recently voted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regulations regarding use and use of social networking sites . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it is accepted by the Parliament , users and users will need to register social media into Egypt with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up that is in@@ ordin@@ ated to give citizens a permission to grant social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within six months of the adoption of the law , users and users have to register on the website of the site with their proper names and personnel evidence to be able to use social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it fails to do so , that could bring a sentence of up to six months in prison or a pen@@ sion@@ ance .
the bill that consists of six parks , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice , video heads and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is en@@ forced upon when there is no indication of how Egyptian authorities are to im@@ pose on how Egyptian authorities are supposed to do , who do not register the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to guarantee regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliament@@ arians and sponsors of the law@@ suit , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received from the telec@@ om Ministry , and a password &quot; to get across the fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocked . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to educate a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of which it would be necessary for Egypt to submit information about their identity to access the network .
but so far , it is not known that such plans exist .
experts and experts on the spot are sc@@ ep@@ tical regarding the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; leader of research technology &quot; ) the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( EI@@ PR , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , &quot; told Global Vo@@ ices :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I doubt strongly about the technical capacities and the understanding of every authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they do not control physical public and private spaces it could be done online .
if I take them seriously , this means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who submit a permit or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring them to a court process .
this is technically no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must be discussed at the legislative elections and constitutional committees before it goes into the debate debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement shall be successful or not , the draft is consistent with a pro @-@ military monument in parliament , in which sense the control is maxim@@ ised and ensured that no so@@ fter nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year the parliament@@ arians Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ ha@@ wy founded a law@@ suit against cy@@ ber crime , in which a lifetime sentence for those intended to be found guilty of thre@@ aten the &apos; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

high up in the mountains of the Kur@@ dist@@ an in the Nor@@ theast of Ira@@ ks are working the Tier@@ sh@@ ütz@@ erin H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the non @-@ government organization Nature Iraq to protect the intellectu@@ als Persian leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of leop@@ ards that mat@@ ures through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat , and since they find less prey .
why is this particular type of leop@@ ards so important ?
like R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; the Persian leop@@ ard the only remaining rob@@ ber@@ y in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the thought of ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a big rob@@ ber is present .
the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ards in the free hunting is small and goes against zero . when the team in the video is thus determined that they have a shot of a great cat in the camera , R@@ aza breaks into pure joy .
as a trained Biolog@@ in R@@ aza is passionate about a different side of their country that has not only been out of war and conflict .
it has been involved in col@@ lage studies for wild animals and educational programs for six years .
it has been a member of IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to providing protection zones for wild animals in the region of Kur@@ dist@@ an .

in the beginning of March 2017 , the progress made in the nor@@ theastern United Kingdom of Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o , the progress made in the last six years to re@@ construct the life of the three @-@ fold disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a violent earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima had triggered the disaster .
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Send@@ ai , which is located in the Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the Pre@@ f@@ ecture Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was an unusual pre@@ fabric@@ ation in Japan , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring villages of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate have been forced forced , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had let entire coastal towns disappear from the map .
in addition , the Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima still lived a nuclear accident , already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses .
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o shows which progress has been achieved for six years to rebuild the life of local resident .
the full report of the newspaper involves both statistics of the Japanese authorities and survey results of those affected .
the housing situation in Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reported that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement man@@ sions ( co@@ ar@@ ab , in , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were completed .
the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures could record Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here , 80 percent of the planned replacement desk were finished .
I@@ w@@ ate is completed 75 per cent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima is up with 70 percent the final light .
at the same time , people still strive for six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated from Beh@@ el@@ ow ( in the south @-@ minute , kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final spare @-@ houses .
after the three @-@ fold disaster almost 80 000 people were forced to live in containers .
in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such claims .
almost 40 percent of the Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima still live in emergency accommodation , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i is still successful in emergency shel@@ ters . more than 75 per cent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated complex@@ es , which moved to the disaster in containers , were converted into final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate the number is here at 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by the un@@ happiness , their p@@ for@@ ting until December 2016 , which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , industrial reconstruction is far more difficult in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
during nearly 100 per cent of the fish@@ eries har@@ b@@ ors in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation in Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima only 30 percent of the fish@@ eries har@@ b@@ ors have re@@ ap@@ ed their operation .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and atomic accident , have moved into ro@@ dent in the three pre@@ f@@ ecture of agri@@ cultur@@ ally .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i managed to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of the agricultural land in Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima can be used again .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic fact , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed A@@ cker@@ el of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima , are located in the nuclear wave zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has reg@@ ained again to recover , but again Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima remains far off .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate can be up to 90 percent at the same stand as before the un@@ happiness . Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima , on the other hand , can only be found 75 per cent here .
however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reported that since the catastrophe , nearly half of the coast @-@ inhabitants , it is harder to find their living .
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to be able to establish a total image , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the native population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ated results . she asked them about the state of re@@ building and also how their sensation has changed against the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper explains :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey to bring more about ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local resident , measures have taken to be prepared to be prepared to the future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ amis .
however , 55.@@ 9 per cent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed that still has@@ n &apos;t been done enough in terms of disasters .
as it is to those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima
in their output to the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has strengthened its attention on the situation of ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima .
Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima still had to experience the enormous earthquake and devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima was also witness of the worst , disasters caused , atomic facts , the Japan ever had to experience .
from 160 000 Ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were moved into areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima , have been converted into long @-@ lasting spare @-@ houses .
after the booth of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima off their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the cat@@ astroph@@ ism , most of the ev@@ acu@@ ated shel@@ ters are older than 50 years old . you have to compete in correct Beh@@ aus@@ ages , because the efforts for reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima are competing with massive construction projects . this is a building projects , the part of the Olympic Games are to be held in Tokyo .
the World is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people encounter people from other countries , speaking a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , it is often seen that a more re@@ connect than it seems at first glance .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , extend our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at precisely these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat themes that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five global Vo@@ ices members who remember one moment in which they have felt highly connected with someone over voice and country limits .
Ver@@ on@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man talks about how the love for music worked from the Iranian culture ; Adriana M@@ aci@@ as speaks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

an Brasi@@ lian student at the age of 33 was initiated this week in the Inten@@ sive station : last Friday had struck him a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a head@@ stock against the head . flood@@ ed millions of protest@@ ers participated in a protest against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , the social sciences studied at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated this Saturday and now have put it into an artificial coma .
its state is regarded as critical .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , spread out rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
the pictures also identi@@ fies the face of the police officer , which was identified with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police force in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás were known that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been sus@@ pen@@ ed until the conclusion of the investigation into the incident of active service .
the pictures show the police officer , as he suggests in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his stroke at the face of the students Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
would a police be@@ am@@ ter sed by a demonstr@@ ator and would land on the intensive station would be his face six months on television and the entire oppression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , divided the video on the net in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several sanitary briefly to him .
another video with the same scenes , but from another perspective is also filmed in social networks .
in the shown clip you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus at the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another federal state , the internet user has now donated 10,000 Brasi@@ lian re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be bra@@ ve , Mat@@ eus .

the drawing has been divided more than several times in social networks .

on Facebook calls Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado further violence attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás in memory :
Go@@ i@@ ás experienced a wave of political force : here , the milit@@ aries of an W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group joined forces to crimin@@ alize and here was a occupied school with a gas station . and now we have been attacked the very sad fall of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who is in the intensive farm after he was attacked by a polic@@ eman , who has turned him down with a stroke .
police @-@ gri@@ ps
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , in which it came to brutal police actions against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
polic@@ emen continued at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where protest@@ ers had a stage for speakers , Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ rade and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and peac@@ eke@@ eping party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police via loud@@ speakers to reno@@ un@@ ce violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this also includes a report in fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country .
once again , the Brazilian media tr@@ aps ver@@ ified by focusing on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window @-@ board .
the fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo controlled over a v@@ ented glass window with a photo of their titles illustr@@ ative .
on the other hand , the O Glo@@ bo preferred a title @-@ story with one in brand @-@ added bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic cause , more about a broken window player than about the protests of thousands of people who serve defense of a special thing .
this must also recognise if you are strictly against any form of atomic damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also here , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is an absurd , dispro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence @-@ made of the military police , with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ating &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ating &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the police &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the villages of the un@@ in@@ duced villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the Act of Á@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar imports in Cuba had the doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the Volks@@ gemein@@ de Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western cub@@ an province of May@@ ab@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar be@@ ck@@ le - no matter what there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest@@ ed on site .
it is two years ago when the activities were put into the sugar be@@ et factories .
after the decline , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory moved , and after its installations , until only the frame of steel and concrete remained remaining .
approximately 272 workers had to re @-@ inv@@ ent itself .
some changes the work .
others re@@ signed and comm@@ ute daily to the factories , which still mah@@ len .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , which rises every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not smoke his sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he heard that in the east of the region of sugar cane prints , who are in operation after a long in@@ active time because they were received .
this was something he had not expected .
N@@ ene is just remin@@ is@@ cent that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would be obtained the sugar@@ be@@ hr@@ fabrik , but the promise has not been held .
the sugar industry had already resi@@ sted on the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ effic@@ ien@@ cies , the poor management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 the production was 1,6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced amount .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news would have been a motive for alarm for the country a few decades ago , but poor harvest@@ s are already no news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
why was the Cub@@ an sugar@@ be@@ ech industry swit@@ ched ?
the old railway station of the church saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar consumption industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar be@@ ers were out@@ dated , and hardly competitive were they un@@ sustainable for the country .
the initial idea was to focus on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives , which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless the added price increased about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 Report &quot; agricultural spec@@ tives &quot; of the OECD and FA@@ O , the agricultural and nutritional organisation of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3,@@ 6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar exports would be around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day is certainly going into the story , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro , during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
in the following years the lact@@ ation of a total of 98 sugar factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened in the sugar lo@@ hr@@ fabrik Greg@@ orio Arl@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked since 1967 in the factory .
if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closing of the factory , is the word he is most repeated , &quot; fraud . &quot;
almost all inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down .
thus the place will be preserved , they formed a full time - working group .
before the first dinner year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially written documents that would only be removed from the parts that would be removed from the add@@ ress@@ age and date .
all have been signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could be mi@@ red .
from there the responsibility was over@@ d@@ ged and the letters came more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the living factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for which he was still working in operation .
Eddy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the pen@@ sion@@ ing in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will at the breast@@ feeding of the factory , in whose construction he was helped .
with each part he left , dismant@@ led he one of his 31 work@@ years .
the developed industry developed by Cuba and more important job producers has been ext@@ ingu@@ ished .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for jobs and services that generated the installations in communities where they found themselves .
we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech delivered from October 21 , 2002 , the then president in the eyes of those present people saw that for the areas , whose factories had@@ n &apos;t been in use for five years , everything would run good .
the price of the population for the closing of sugar cane
since 2004 sugar@@ tube is extrac@@ ted only high by the deposit .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the People &apos;s community of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich began to change many things , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar factory closed , or better said than they began , they mostly heard , but they also hear@@ ken@@ ed to asp@@ iring the street , this dis@@ advant@@ aged also other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , had to look for kid@@ n@@ ene and Eddy other factories .
they have been recommended to spare parts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without future perspective , many young people also left the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area was created in the area , whose production serves not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impos@@ ing .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene went back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .

first Nations Youth People use Hip Hop to express themselves and maintain their own culture

young people from the First Nations Communities in all of Canada are dealing with issues that are important for them . they do this by Hip Hop , thanks to a series of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour since 2014 , workshop managers have worked directly to schools and youth centers in order to teach youth groups of son@@ g@@ writing , recording , audi@@ o- and video @-@ production and live performances .
the original workshops were initiated by the Ped@@ ago@@ gues David Hod@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and in Nord @-@ Quebec with ten cl@@ ree @-@ communities and then with the C@@ ree Hip Hop group The North@@ star collabor@@ ated together .
the workshop thus increases the young participants in talks on such as &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self acceptance or whatever comes into mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations Communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the k@@ iss@@ kal@@ um First State in British Columbia tells , for example , the history of the highway 16 , also called &quot; highway of tears , &quot; an street section in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen people were left indigenous young women disappeared or mur@@ dered .
the cases were largely unknown .
the next video of Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the mot@@ if of a video games to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences of globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although youth have not always domin@@ ate the languages of the First Nations languages .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation have recorded , the chor@@ us is sung to C@@ ree .
the young people involved got some help from Gary Jol@@ ly from North@@ star Hip Hop group , who gave them a St@@ rop@@ he in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
on the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an stands at the St@@ rop@@ he in turn , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to go on the earth my days
this is the day when you turn our cry
because we as youth have lost our way to life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and face our youth
this is how they can do what they are determined by the Creator
in the commentary box , the reader and supporters of the C@@ ree @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also gives a contribution and adds the St@@ rop@@ he published in Sil@@ en@@ closure ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :

in Japan one can see above almost every restaurant of sculp@@ tural dishes .
to show the potential customers what exactly on the menu , are located near the entrance sho@@ ok , &quot; Plast@@ ische models of the dishes &quot; ) of each speaker , which is served in this restaurant .
the customers look at these plastic gr@@ ated courts and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic gr@@ ated courts .
in the to@@ ki@@ ot district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a variety of these small companies that produce even those plastic film@@ makers Wim Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic gr@@ ated ones are so usually that they don &apos;t even record them anymore . a new trend is transformed , however today in con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets .
with Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the Blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos , which show this unusual tw@@ ist with the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ kh@@ u .
now on sale : new with plastic gr@@ ated cell phones , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu Kauf@@ haus .
many of these arti@@ fic@@ tional foods were turned to cor@@ rug@@ ated collection objects , as in this case , cooling @-@ out magn@@ ets :
here are some Sho@@ oting C@@ ups for a new exhibition at Tokyo @-@ Station .
the new boom of Essen@@ ti@@ fications is becoming more and more aw@@ kward .
in this case a ka@@ ons @-@ don ( a popular score with seafood ) turned into a mobile phone stand .
for this tri@@ ang@@ ular bowl ( lol ) we found a good use as a mobile phone @-@ rack .
we also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple that hold your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a cand@@ y for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing connecting flight .
some mobile phones and mobile phones allow you to manufacture your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or sal@@ mon are used , a popular to@@ pping which is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
is there anyone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can betra@@ yed my mobile phone with sal@@ mon ? &quot;
I think I will probably be the only one .
this interest in plastic gr@@ ated may also assume a less appeti@@ zing form , to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our new mobile phone @-@ stands has the form of mel@@ ting ice .
in addition , there are also travel st@@ ables ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , E@@ arr@@ ings and Hand@@ y@@ bands from dried sal@@ mon .

if you would like to know more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the town of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the Bel@@ i@@ ef@@ dru@@ k Restaurant . such as with sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ kh@@ u .

a Mexican project tells the stories of the survi@@ vor@@ s of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the victims of the fight against the drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of foreign and foreign media on the in@@ famous &quot; struggle against drugs trading &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ erable and mis@@ eries regularly emerge only in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle has .
the coverage of drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ Kart@@ ell , the stories of the victims of the conflict strongly pushed into the background .
on the day after a violent case , barely anyone looking at the trau@@ ma or to the municipalities who have learned to live with the pain .
there are behind each cor@@ pse , behind every button in the hundreds of hidden bas@@ soon tom@@ bs , the stories of numerous parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wo@@ unds might never cure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Anim@@ al Pol@@ í@@ tico will learn the digital project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vivi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with drug trading live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) to give that sacrifice a voice and tells stories of people who were told in the fight between criminal prosec@@ ution and cart@@ els . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anim@@ al Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organised crime can not only be afraid of our lives .
the impact is much more profound .
for example , if stores close , because they are threatened by drug hands and whole communities have to drive a lot of kilometers to buy something like milk .
pain of victims
a video with the title &quot; vi@@ das que cam@@ bian por el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; like anxiety life changes &quot; ) tells them exactly these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who ad@@ diction every weekend of secret tom@@ bs after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Rod@@ r@@ í@@ guez , who was on only one day their father , their four si@@ bl@@ ings , their husband and two of their ne@@ ph@@ ew .
priest : &quot; like every Sunday we prepare ourselves today again on the task that we asked ourselves to get rid of and by gra@@ ves , according to the people we loved to seek . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Contr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Contr@@ eras M@@ ata .
he was 28 , when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in a electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13th he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came back again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am alone with three children who need a training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , which is also here with me .
at the moment , she has no income .
you are aware of the insurance of my father , but they don &apos;t get paid off because they demand a mort@@ ality .
where should we go ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; Apr@@ on a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we do not only have to show the faces of those who face fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and government .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in Hoch@@ ris@@ iko territories .
here are some extracts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Anim@@ al Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central mex@@ ico .
your contribution reminds us that violence should never be viewed as normal , regardless of what form they occur :
I know the disease and the sensation of journ@@ alism already for several years now .
I &apos;m passing by date every day and see the titles pages with images , which actually only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from Ak@@ ten of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it acts as lack of respect towards the person who belonged to this body once .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider it normal .
you write on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 year old c@@ ous@@ in thinks that he is fo@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) will be if he is great . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hel@@ dent@@ ures &quot; of the off@@ ences if they go through the streets .
for me it is , when they were to the ones who have lost someone and those who fear that they have happened that way .
I see our weakness if stories about mere numbers are in a stati@@ stic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Tat@@ en@@ lessness of people is incredibly for me if the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring town will therefore be justified that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emig@@ rated &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to say that they remain spar@@ ed by such trag@@ e@@ dies if they are not st@@ ir and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months Com@@ press@@ ment in the main city district : like a family with threats to pl@@ under@@ ed it , until it was destroyed by the end not only the business but also their family were tor@@ n apart .
you think of everything you lost and remember how some people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain of this never goes , the trau@@ ma will remain , the fear is coming once again if you are alone .
habits have changed , telephone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the more we are removed , the better .
they included their report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , as one does not know when they are kid@@ n@@ apped or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days whether there would be my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but that reply is no , for I forgot how to cr@@ ying . I have to learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of war shared . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions on such as : who takes care of the child of a mixed woman and a man who was killed by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mex@@ ik@@ os ?
he is not like other boys of his age whose parents care about them .
Br@@ yan is a commodity and he tells you had to teach himself how to drink a egg , potatoes , tortil@@ las , tortil@@ las , and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies which live with him . this is his name for preparing the fl@@ yers with water , sugar and milk pul@@ ses .
he tells of the nine fo@@ ols on his left leg - one for every lifetime .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and the learning had to live in order to live .
when he was five years old he told him that his mother was van@@ ished .
but that was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood has been past two years ago when he was just a couple of blocks from his home , the bloody ly@@ re of his father saw that by armed men out of a passing car was shot .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez saw the situation :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence against organised crime and fighting against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez in 2006 .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murder for public security and the Government of the Government of the United States .
alone , the prosec@@ ut@@ or &apos;s Bar was 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the average 8.5 Mor@@ den per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of words that have organized organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
few stories still live in the face of new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we must not forget .
in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vivi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; founded the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 , its aim is to present the complex information behind the failed struggle against drugs , which has paved the country in the last four decades , in intelli@@ gible manner .
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ ing is Car@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Flick@@ r User Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages that he links , include images in which violence is represented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact check is important in a moment in which it &apos;s about to raise a rum@@ or , or f@@ ake a f@@ ake .
but how is the years after the first time sur@@ faced ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , incl@@ ined to continue to exist .
take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR@@ C ) .
since its first release it was mis@@ leading to gu@@ ise trag@@ e@@ dies which actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false p@@ airing of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in termin@@ ology by Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - deny not the fact that there are abundant reporting of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our longing for images on news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a pet@@ rol trucks at the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te around and explo@@ ded . 230 people came alive .
after the civil war , Africa has been neglected north @-@ largest country for years and thereby devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become dangerous paths filled with stro@@ kes , which were difficult to sail .
trag@@ ically , the tank @-@ car fell victim to the victim .
administration &apos;s representatives described a fire@@ ball , the d@@ utz@@ ing houses , including a cin@@ emas in the vicinity , which was full of people who vivi@@ d the football championship .
houses f@@ law@@ ed and ch@@ ast@@ ed cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to infin@@ ity .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur users Myst@@ ical Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Mehr@@ ere photos of the incident form the gray scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows sub@@ stolen bodies that are open on the ground while people watch them .
but here the story does not find its end .
over the years the same photo has been written several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , although real , but not related to trag@@ e@@ dies , particularly events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , the fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am disc@@ usses the Nig@@ eri@@ an towns of B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dra@@ stically by atro@@ cities before they were forced to fle@@ e .
houses and shops were burned down and cor@@ respon@@ ds in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one remained back to count , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a residents to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were destroyed , shot or burned .
only in the basis of satellite images , the following time could be displayed .
the occasion for the attack was likewise un@@ solved , but the arm@@ ing point in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ ella and the attempt of the B@@ oko Har@@ am , to gain land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture of the DR Congo came back again , as evi@@ d@@ ently prove to be evidence of the fact and the potential extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a mass@@ acre to 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
you are not Charlie .
you are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ cre@@ asing use of the image of the DR Congo is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has been documented for Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was taken as a test@@ ament to mass@@ ages .
still a step further bring personal comments like this example , the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in relation to deliver arguments .
the image from the che@@ ek also entered in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a light@@ ning , published by the United Nations those who were able to fle@@ e , rape , and et@@ ected t@@ ote , some due to burning .
while others reported from violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Post@@ s like the following ones who brought this descriptions with photos from the Democratic Republic of Congo :
this picture comes from a sau@@ di @-@ Arab news page , which was reported to 2012 , the President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ a Being told , mon@@ ks and politicians would have participated in the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim . in addition , she used the image of the DR Congo to record this information .
the original article on which the last on 26 April 2017 has been picked up , can be called here .
other news organizations who called AF@@ P as their source , were also mist@@ aken Th@@ a ness that had attributed this statement , but had not associated with the image of the DR Congo .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false cou@@ pling until the years 2011 and 2012 are coming back and actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enclosed image look &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be seen how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a revers@@ ed image look with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found at 18.@@ 8 billion images ( status of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the said image of the DR Congo .
they come from a mis@@ ch@@ mas@@ ch private site , platforms social media and community as well as national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed wrong reports , se@@ w others trying to un@@ masks the f@@ eit@@ ing .
we have examples of abuse of abuse and associated with the respective countries , on which page they had been published . by doing so , we want to represent the reach more clearly than through the language itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the countries below ( which in some cases were linked with each other ) multiple examples may be used for abuse of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some cases which can now be fully ins@@ ulated ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
lists of false positions of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the or@@ an@@ gled countries point out pages or server through the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ seh@@ oods are still available .
the countries in Gray are examples which are according to the met@@ adata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing examples .
as a memory , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this article from 2014 about students who were killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the author An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , has expressly explained that the image does not origin@@ ate from the k@@ ill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar d@@ schi@@ ha@@ dist@@ ic attack &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

there are further confirmed examples of an incorrect usage of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , ag@@ greg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the folder in grey ) , however , are no longer completely re@@ trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and time / date stamp exist on the web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and disp@@ ose it via image names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original mis@@ fortune of 2010 , the image is ultimately possibly a correct description , but the original article is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( frames ) which draw this post . the first frame focused on religion .
the photo was used regarding major discussions on the silence in relation to the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ yas by Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how a afri@@ can live in comparison to a European or French life .
religion should be understood and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth examine how pictures are used in connection with these efforts .
but a profound question is what happens when reading these images no longer can believe .
with social media there are tens of people who have acci@@ dentally share the water around a tragedy .
suggested this mood of mis@@ conception and mis@@ mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and nar@@ ro@@ ds the real sm@@ ew@@ ing of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the dis@@ sem@@ ination of dis@@ counted images has already been revised in detail ( here for example ) .
an argument is that the with@@ hold of pictures of a ref@@ us@@ al to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even demanded by the victims .
at the same time , the concern that violent images readers and viewers des@@ ens@@ it@@ ise them and give them the ability to emp@@ athy emp@@ athy ( such as this study , who sought , how violent media work on it , others to help ) .
while there is a lot to discuss with for@@ amer &apos;s represent@@ ations in the news media , the fact that it is indispensable for today &apos;s message reporting .
Techn@@ ologists experiment experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . you will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture is suggested by the context or by completely mis@@ used species .
however , any investigation is wrong grants , but should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog unveil@@ ed the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photographs from Andy S@@ imm@@ ons used in accordance with CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. D@@ t. inde@@ struc@@ tible ) makes every effort to offer lingu@@ istic enth@@ used a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
there are words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ translated words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ m@@ esa ) .
however , all resi@@ sti@@ ble stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly with any attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , which is a complete explanation and sometimes a context required to understand exactly what is meant to do with this one word .
these unique words have already been collected quite a time in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese , or Finnish words , during the author and Lingu@@ ist from &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find an example words from the VAT level of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ an you to recognise your parents in recognition of how you have tried in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - The ease or la@@ zin@@ ess you feel after having gotten around cold days in the sun . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they sne@@ ak other cultures , reve@@ aling other thought @-@ eng@@ ths and wake up our curiosity .
sometimes , how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the Lingu@@ ists on this site would like to publish any more of these &quot; un@@ mistak@@ able &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
Red@@ ner of the &quot; Tre@@ asure Langu@@ ages , &quot; which are much appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite sw@@ ells here .

how Sri Lanka is rec@@ alled by the worst fl@@ ut@@ ary disaster of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is currently one of the most serious high @-@ water and terrestrial disaster in this decade .
triggered by mon@@ soon , which is usually in late May , are characterized by strong ra@@ inf@@ alls the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , gin , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
after an opinion of the area of Kat@@ astroph@@ es of Sri Lanka of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and barely hundreds of thousands become mixed because of the flo@@ ods and mud .
over 400 000 people have been affected by the last Friday ( 26 May ) and around 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe resi@@ dences .
the rains left on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the waters in some areas went back slowly .
health and hygiene situations present a massive challenge in the affected areas and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following photos and videos give an impression of the extent of the fl@@ att@@ ing disaster :
flo@@ ods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water boards from up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like Azz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ et delivering regular updates to the flood plan .
many use the has@@ ht@@ ag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly disease wor@@ sen the Den@@ gu@@ e@@ fi@@ eber@@ crisis , save the Children , after further ra@@ inf@@ alls are already on its way .
today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was standing in the flood , water@@ front up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ag@@ oda near G@@ alle also flood@@ ed because of the yesterday evening of the Mor@@ og@@ oda E@@ la .
the Air Force has five planes available for lif@@ egu@@ ards and another five are made available for transport@@ ing emer@@ gen@@ cies for the residents made in their flood@@ ed villages .
even various organizations and start@@ ups have prepared to help .
Facebook @-@ Pages , such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tory in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high water supply and humanitarian assistance .

&quot; &quot; &quot; last year after the catastrophe of the Tro@@ pen@@ stur@@ m Ro@@ an@@ u , the Pick@@ Me led a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high water help &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button to call it users to pick up a vehicle to pick up support and donations . these were then transmitted free to the sr@@ il@@ ant Red Cross . &quot; &quot; &quot;
likewise , they conducted a &quot; SOS &quot; button , which had over thousand requests and 150 successful boat lines for high water and awakening people .
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kas , where multiple social media platforms are fully exploited , people will bring people in need for security and do guidance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has prevented the loss of other human lives , whereas the population of Sri Lan@@ kas are now ahead of the long path to restoring norm@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ ib G@@ ha@@ zi .
use J@@ t.@@ Dam@@ as in January I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neigh@@ bor and love friend .
I trusted her my four year old daughter to famili@@ ari@@ ze her children ; she is my rock in the bran@@ ding .
in one minute we call for the rights of women .
in the next sk@@ etch we push rights for trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some keep the iconic picture of a woman with head @-@ cloth high , bound from an American flag , other sk@@ ir@@ cular parks against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my friend look at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already run this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years - the Sah@@ ar , who know it - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; who has established themselves in their conception .
they escape me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion different .
we identify to be a Muslim on different species but somehow we will all put into the same Muslim dra@@ wer .
this dra@@ wer is in our collective idea so well designed that once Muslims that do not fit in there , escape .
de@@ gener@@ ative will be m@@ ashed
I am not alone with that alone .
that even has happened to the poet , whose poetry in America is best selling is : Rum@@ i .
which pictures do you come to mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
as a Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am , he was a orthodo@@ x Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ars .
Islam , the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad were until the day he died , the centre of his poetry .
but the religion of Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a huge part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims from this world .
another consists in the reduced images of Muslims , Western books have been col@@ oni@@ fied for centuries .
this temp@@ ting picture is determined by the dark husband to fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the landmark Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid was crus@@ hed by the history behind these pictures in the 19@@ 70s .
but these images also rise further today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood remains ver@@ ste@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , incorrect Nar@@ rative our news fe@@ eds was dominant .
this nar@@ rative is over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have managed to have their countries , while the US could not even vote their first female Presi@@ dential candidates .
this nar@@ rative fails to recognize that when French , Muslim women are prevented from doing their head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings and sau@@ di @-@ Arabic , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
a powerful group exercises its &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong f@@ law weak@@ ens Muslim women who run movements for change .
it looks beyond that the first Muslim prayers were spoken to African land of Afri@@ kan@@ ers who were hi@@ therto been killed here with slavery .
it del@@ etes the existence of que@@ er Muslims .
this nar@@ rative has st@@ alled our collective imagination of such deeply and f@@ law@@ ed that often Sik@@ h men and children become the aim of anti @-@ cosmic attacks and anch@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because of these stories , which we tell and due to the way we are telling it , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is today not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to include 1.7 billion
in the news industry , we do more than just stories to tell , based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ rative who help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to grasp the nar@@ ration of 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we have spoken here where seven million Muslims attain that in the highest grade &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; various &quot; religious group &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over one third of the entire Muslim population are African Americans .

four decades ago my dear parents came to live in New York to live their American dream .
my mother put her first gem design on 5th Avenue before and my father worked hard in the skyscr@@ apers of New York ; skyscr@@ apers were made possible by the Muslim , American statistics from Bangladesh with the name conclusion Rah@@ man Khan .
back then as Khan thought the Sky@@ lines of the world was emerging , my parents were un@@ um@@ ented Muslims and Americans .
but am I now un@@ um@@ bled Muslims and Americ@@ an@@ erin ?
sometimes , if people ask people why I don &apos;t tell a por@@ k , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes , or my hand@@ sh@@ am error , which all Muslims carry in themselves - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I Scher@@ ze , we do not carry all T@@ ash@@ mi@@ ane with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also need to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who are trying to fight far widespread lies across Islam .
these lies are produced on the current volume of a well @-@ fine Islam@@ ism machine with back@@ ers , Th@@ ink tanks and experts for counter@@ f@@ information which is our already faul@@ ty picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
due to the stories that we tell and due to the way we are telling it , there is Islam@@ opho@@ bia in more than just a stran@@ ger who knows the head of a woman .
or as the start@@ ling map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole USA , see below .

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ugly forms takes up our affili@@ ation .

I want to explain this .
I was born as Muslim , but to be a Muslim but was born only in my imagination , when I was four years old , in a pro@@ visional mosque in the basement of a Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian Church in New York .
when social dialogue describe religious life , they attack the following terms : faith , behavi@@ ours , and belonging .
my Muslim belief and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend would see my neighbour , my coat in the bran@@ ding that I am Muslims , if they could look through the 15 feet concrete and air that separate our homes .
she would see the all@@ ab@@ ble ritual with my daughter when I wi@@ den it in my arms , and set up the Arab verses for the protection of the Quran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
I repeat three times each of them .
I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim belief is perhaps not always visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims means to speak the prayers they told me if I have a bad day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims need to be how she brought me to God : Allah M@@ ian , what God means , my only Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a people , that - over centuries - by a &quot; Empire &quot; colonial , which has established a company with the name of Ven@@ erable Brit@@ ische Ost@@ ini@@ dia @-@ Komp@@ anie , it has a deep meaning , God , my only Lord .

belonging is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians whose families , such as with my grandfather , of col@@ oni@@ alists were raised , who have shared the Muslim world as at stake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans were colon@@ ized all the up to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means knowing that the first fly bom@@ b of history was turned out over a century about a Muslim country .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ y sub@@ ordin@@ ate of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous , &quot; as he caused the first mosque in England .
even before it existed , he jour@@ ne@@ yed in more parts of the world than I had ever been and pre@@ ached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim strain of 1.7 billion people go deeply into our unforgettable st@@ ables ; our uns@@ ett@@ led history .
it means to remember that four@@ teen years ago the migh@@ ti@@ est military in the world , distributed with forces that were distributed over every continent apart from the Antarc@@ tic , distributed in Iraq to em@@ ulate weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the w@@ reck@@ age of the war .
an American Muslim to realize that the murder rate of veter@@ an has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy w@@ ai@@ ves the US and the susp@@ ects has a Muslim name that covers the story of four times more than a story with a white attacks .
it means knowing that four@@ teen hundred years ago the first prayer call , the A@@ za@@ an , was called by a free black slaves named Bil@@ al .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought to that country two hundred years ago .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X a American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people filled the airports to fight against the Muslim .
it is the hope I feel when we stand for our dreams and if we say black life are .
an Americ@@ an@@ erin to be a Pak@@ ist@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , means the in@@ dur@@ ated inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our with multiple connec@@ tive ident@@ ities , but to fail to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the nar@@ ration of 1.7 billion creates more possibilities than a mag@@ ician , but is represented in the reduced amount of doubt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that powerful and privileged people on this branch are structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in the Muslim registry , which began with President Bush and have been exp@@ elled under President Obama .
it consists of per@@ me@@ able monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration officer , who takes a five year old child in a handic@@ ra@@ vels .
it exists in a country that con@@ cludes its borders towards people from just the countries that bom@@ bed it .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly @-@ list , &quot; which largely Arabs and Muslims takes into the Vis@@ ier .
it is the wars that we lead and the bom@@ bs we cast on Muslim countries .
because of the stories that we are telling and due to those who we do not tell , we are here today .
in a study with the title A@@ scent of Man , the scientists of North@@ western University showed a scienti@@ fically im@@ proper picture and they can judge them , groups on a scale of 1 to 100 with respect to evolution .
Muslims received the sli@@ gh@@ test score .
the con@@ greg@@ ations that we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are deeply committed to the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come back decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous expression that we engage in our news actions .
at least there is an increasing movement , led by American Muslim within the media industry , which tries to capture our frequently with connec@@ tive ident@@ ities and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast See Some@@ thing , S@@ ay Some@@ thing from Bu@@ zz@@ aia ; the vir@@ al Vide@@ os@@ erie Secret Li@@ ves ; Schu@@ sters Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , multip@@ ly Muslim authors to print and Ms Mar@@ vel , Pak@@ ist@@ ically , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .

col@@ lage the author .
but I am concerned with this difficult global time@@ frame in which we are located .
and that moment has consequences that go beyond 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspir@@ ators the@@ or@@ ist , who existed in the dark corners of the internet , now will make the White House .
they have grown exp@@ on@@ ential because Muslims have made Muslims from others .
there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ entially by created the &quot; other &quot; .
a few years ago it had not yet been given ; now they domin@@ ate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and history of which I was not aware of how I was as old as it is my daughter now , but that made me today to an un@@ winding Muslim .
things that I have left here like a bread@@ cr@@ um@@ per in my speech .
things that might aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ sec@@ tions that makes our humanity out like a story , where one is made to another . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , they will be taking place at the 8th annual conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more than one hundred academ@@ ics speak about our problems with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; structural racism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell the here at this TE@@ D@@ x talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where but Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are being guided , and men led by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public performance four decades ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions after the role of being aware and un@@ aware of the &quot; other &quot; that we have had a new future , in which we have no president , the chocolate festival , while he already broken lands and &quot; to other &quot; people bombar@@ ded , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,7 billion .
it begins with all of us .
initiative for Nar@@ l@@ art wants to preserve regional diversity
stories about Flick@@ r @-@ User Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be an opportunity to connect here and now in spite of a language barrier to anyone ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Tre@@ asure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the count of stories in their original language is a possible answer to that .
global Vo@@ ices reported a short report about another initiative by Steven Bird , the Un@@ translated blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of big cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ a@@ kland in the United States , where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages do not be given to the children &apos;s born children .
for the makers of the project applies :
the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that accept Di@@ versity - safe spaces where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to join in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen often associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bring these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to appreciate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ eller would first introduce their story in their own language and translate them into English .
even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their devot@@ ion will lead and their representation to that the audi@@ ences can be initiated .
they call forth laugh@@ ing and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
for example , the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Fas@@ o that is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ ellers of R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou are also the opportunity to explain to their country typical customs of nar@@ rative .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the fork of the rab@@ bit and the pump in the language Sh@@ ona from Zim@@ babwe :
after he explains the meaning of his fur , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked , &quot; How is it speaking to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide dit@@ ches he shares his sense of the inclusi@@ veness :
you have listened to !
you were attentive ...
they were very happy with me !
up to now the events of Tre@@ asure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling in three cities have taken place , and the organizers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS in order to organise their own stories .
Puerto Rico ur@@ ges the United States
with the aim of re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took up to 72 million US dollars , participated in the last 3 April 2017 various religious and civil organizations in a mass demonstration ; the march started in the histor@@ ian Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
she was called by the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano por la Audit@@ or@@ ía de la D@@ eu@@ da &quot; ( Civil War for the ural examination of the debts ) and of the Eastern Assembly of Puerto Ric@@ os .
the inter@@ c@@ essors of the re @-@ placement of the debt have also made a pet@@ ition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os is that politicians , ban@@ kers and government agencies responsible for debts are accountable for their corruption .
we call for a financial test and a conference committee without personal interests in public debts , with a firm , our working conditions , which acts in favour of the economy .
we will be black@@ mail@@ ed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os refuse to pay a debt that is not their .
we will not choose between education and health .
our Rent@@ als will not take place with decl@@ ining retirement payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not in the state of state @-@ built territory of the US - suff@@ ers from a serious financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; an government @-@ independent non @-@ profit organization without party membership must be focused on socio @-@ economic development , a law for state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state control .

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web@@ developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian government , his supporters and relatives were continuing the campaign for his freedom , and remind of the contributions he made for an open network .
this year &apos;s year : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on digital culture , which is oriented towards Berlin , devoted to an event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el &apos;s campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the German CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Executive Director of the Book C@@ ost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ enquiry ( The C@@ ost of Freedom : a collective Nach@@ forschung ) .
the book that has been published last year and here license @-@ free is available , contains a number of papers , which deal with the free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this book aims to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what the real costs are , with which this is linked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who have worked on the movements for free knowledge , have worked alongside the fo@@ g to read about the fo@@ g that surrounds our news and to create something from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celeb@@ rating internet volunteer , who has det@@ ained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was cancelled out of the index of Ad@@ ra prison , which he sat on October 3 , 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no information whatsoever about his current state or residence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intro@@ duc@@ tory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive memory gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture , has many of us start to reflect on their own destin@@ ies , actions and decisions .
why are we today here ?
what have we decided ?
what have we given up in this process of time @-@ filled extreme beliefs ?
the web@@ developer for open source and digital activists is since March 2012 in the cust@@ ody of Syrian government agencies .
in October 2015 Bass@@ el was transferred from the Ad@@ ra prison , a non @-@ military establishment to be transferred to an unknown place .
his wife , writer and lawyer , N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police in Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military training from his cell in Ad@@ ra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported it was contacted by individuals on 12 November 2015 , who themselves presented themselves as insi@@ der Assad &apos;s government and took note of a so @-@ called death section against her husband .
its location and state remain still unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in integrating access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Techn@@ ologist and at the moment of the leader of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project , the Bass@@ el founded , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
maybe none of Bas@@ sels cultural prot@@ otypes fores@@ ee than the work he began with a group of ar@@ che@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra Virtu@@ ally .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the path@@ ian of numerous ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ations and here mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architecture with local traditions and Persian influences .
Bass@@ el had not yet know that ten years after having started with this work , the IS would put everything to it , this architecture that does not only em@@ bo@@ died the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this ten@@ se into the digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule created to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of in@@ valuable value .
trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el could not yet finish this project yet .
N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of their man to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my entire life , dream of freedom to dream and b@@ ass@@ el taught me to embrace it .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el brought me English when he was already in cust@@ ody .
I learned to read English well , write and talk .
he always has shared his knowledge with each he has asked . he has taught other inc@@ tions , English to read , write and speak .
Bass@@ el opened to me the door to technology . he taught me to use both computer and smartphones .
he brought me the internet at .
he has also associated other impro@@ per how they use computers , at least theoretically , without that they actually held one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of orph@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a Pro@@ sab@@ uch which she wrote in the years 2012 till 2015 her husband was in cust@@ ody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ oura have worked together on the book for a long time .
they mu@@ g@@ ged the lyrics to him if she visited him and he over@@ took them from the Arabic , English .
the book is license @-@ free available .
book@@ case of Youssef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here &apos;s an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title &quot; It &apos;s happening &quot; :
it happens in every visit ,
that I fail in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the mind in the moment we embrace you
that any of the dangers doesn &apos;t matter ,
everyone of Z@@ ä@@ une , F@@ es@@ seln and W@@ ächter
I forget the thr@@ ong of pris@@ ons
and I enter every detail of your voice and words
who I am with passion for me
when your eyes was probably saying
and I let another piece of my soul with you ...
I return to my lon@@ eliness .
to rede@@ em all the moments ,
and to smile about your absence .
I exagger@@ ate myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the Bass@@ el wrote G@@ ha@@ zi :

Bas@@ sels History is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the regime b@@ ash@@ ar al @-@ Ass@@ ads have disappeared after the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Sy@@ ris@@ cal network for Human Rights ) more than 65,@@ 000 people .
those who were arrested or sei@@ zed under non @-@ violence by the regime , were tor@@ tured or even executed .
until 2016 , since 2011 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nest@@ y International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans in jail since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el for 2012 .
we reiter@@ ate our demand today in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambi@@ que : due to corruption contrac@@ ted director after discharge from prison back to previous post
Mos@@ ambi@@ ance re@@ acted by anger to a corrupt regime , where a govern@@ or after half his sentence has returned to the workplace at the state apparatus at which the corruption was committed .
in this case , Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza is arrested in 2008 and 2010 with four other def@@ endants were sentenced to 22 years imprisonment together with four other def@@ endants ( about 800 000 Euro ) .
the money figur@@ ines from public funds from the airports of Mos@@ ambi@@ que , whose council is Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately urged its re@@ inst@@ at@@ ement to the firm , which was then also happened on April 19th .
in accordance with an opinion of the general secret@@ ary of the Republic , which claims the request , there would be no obstacles to Cam@@ b@@ aza to re @-@ return to his old post since the company was no discipl@@ in@@ ing procedure after his term .
however , many citizens are not working well .
the centre for public integrity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de p@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , briefly CI@@ P ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned into an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to re@@ press the director .
represents a return in the fight against corruption and clar@@ ified the lack of transparency and even a return in terms of the efforts of our legal system , so the CI@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we take note is that the company should have a discipl@@ in@@ arian treatment against the in@@ mit@@ igation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the company sh@@ wie@@ c apparently and promp@@ ted no reasonable legal steps to apply the appropriate functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the mos@@ ambi@@ que social media , reject this behaviour also , and considers the case be contradic@@ tory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent type , he would be advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a sentence and that half has sat down .
he could hold lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and develop his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has un@@ authorized to re@@ integrate into the company that he helped to cause damage .
therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will gladly pay for its silence .
contradic@@ tory !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambi@@ ance and student of political science in Brazil , the director does not mention any mor@@ ality :
Cam@@ b@@ aza from the state is rewarded , because he dism@@ issed him , I can &apos;t believe that one is rewarded someone in such a way that the state has already been so massive .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing to return to mor@@ als and to serve the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead he serves only the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as administ@@ ered to an in@@ exhau@@ sti@@ ble money source and the state itself this man became tired , which was charged and finally sentenced to a long det@@ ention .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te fav@@ ors the Prime Minister of Mos@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remember that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el &apos;s b@@ ambi@@ ans not only to be remembered as the first independent president but also as a sharp , s@@ lic@@ ed and - in the next - proph@@ etic speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of his most famous ver@@ bal depic@@ tions was as he energi@@ zed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ambitious person would be able to be able to sell even the f@@ ather@@ land for his ambitions , his own individual interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that it is not that way . it changes the tactics , but he does not turning away from its ambitions .
a ambitious man is also criminal . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also abl@@ ending :

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users in@@ justice
the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook @-@ users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took her post out of the net , because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although about the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people ost@@ indi@@ an origin or in general use as an ad@@ j@@ ective . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cen@@ sored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or a part of a initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical &quot; nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely ab@@ id@@ able con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists than hate speech against Muslims who constitute a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight out hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos;s can usually be associated with racism related to racism , but the word itself is not automatically step@@ ped out of hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; many people have reported that too , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed by his use .
furthermore , there are several bur@@ mes@@ ical words with basic mean@@ ings which have the same letter like &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written on Bur@@ mes@@ isch also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( Sp@@ age ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos;@@ kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ ie User A@@ ung Ka@@ at declared the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of a friend of mine was deleted today , because he contained the word of Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a great way whether they knew he could lin@@ ders his back pain by making a word play .
the proposition ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the Fr@@ age@@ word ( la ) on Bur@@ mes@@ an - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there have been various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win is the opinion that she will reduce hate speech radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook analytical should be analytical , before it all post@@ ulates , which war@@ dly spread in the suspic@@ ion of racism .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manual .
it fil@@ tering the word automatically .
the automation will not understand what you are looking at Fac@@ et@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words left .
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; ( split@@ ting ) .
the good is that these three @-@ term nation@@ alists spread the hate speech , received a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to circum@@ vent their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all , the hate speech allows the efficiency of this strategy not long to hold .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ alth have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of impact often becomes a cat@@ ch@@ - and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply going to start to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cen@@ sored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described as Facebook started to clear his post@@ s as he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; from social network is ban@@ ished :
... when I was aware of this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the Word is locked .
ir@@ on@@ ically my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited to post the Li@@ ken , post and parts of content for 24 hours because of the Post Office of the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of post@@ ings from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the Hass@@ an nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his mail has been removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech :
mail without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post he shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community ask for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work .
those words to shave will only be more hat@@ red within the different communities .
it seems as if it started it without local context or technical assistance and have banned as words such as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; her@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry . &quot;
even when they found that they have made mistake , they tried not to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied postal mail .
if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits they would have a big turnover , it would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has taken care of a lot of don@@ or among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make themselves funny and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ an , to see if their postcard from the net will be taken .
here you can see some screen@@ shots from Facebook @-@ Post@@ s that have no hate speech , but still far removed :
use with permission .
the bur@@ mes@@ ical text reads &quot; I want to sit on a stool and inher@@ it@@ cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
just to check out whether Facebook contains the mail , which contains the word of Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screens@@ hot , with permission is used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mail rate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you cure people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screens@@ hot , with permission is used .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists , who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should be aff@@ ection@@ ate in the communities in Myanmar in addition , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have forced thousands of escape .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his understanding , critic@@ ized hate speech at its Bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control .
but instead of simply selecting the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it could have been better on the context rather than on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is an end to the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted un@@ anim@@ ously a law that is supposed to offer this practice so that the he@@ ater age is now at 18 .
prior to this change of the spouse , some members held over Hin@@ du@@ ist@@ ischer and Muslim religious communities on the practice , and in May 2016 it came to a great public out@@ cry . back then , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leaders of the religious organization ( I@@ RO ) , a group that state representatives of different religious groups of the country gathered , that the state does not inter@@ f@@ ere since the state , the age is not the maturity &apos; .
this happened in no matter of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contrac@@ tor of the UN &apos;s ancest@@ or , the min@@ ors are as defined , every human being under 18 years of age . &quot;
statistics from the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children , who were already married , in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8,@@ 1 percent .
2011 confirmed the statistical central office of the country , that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online @-@ pet@@ itions and social media @-@ movements that stri@@ ves to establish laws to children , followed at the foot and were great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring this result .
nonetheless , it did not go smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hind@@ u @-@ leader for example had no concern to say the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should be condemned to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition cause tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and at some point , there came doubts as to whether the opposition would not agree to the law .
but early in 2017 the bill is decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of opposition and an independent , which could be discussed , so that he would be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him to the law .
now only the President of the country must agree and declare the law .
one of the Sen@@ ators of the country announced on Facebook a status update , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ agram again :
Mr Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ramb@@ har@@ at : the bill of bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one decided against it .
after having previously agreed in the Senate , the draft can now be applied to the law .
the majority of the social media user was thrilled , because the laws were finally changed to the children &apos;s marriage .
Facebook @-@ Member Lo@@ vell Francis , who at the Council of Education in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has taken too much time and unnecessary talk , which has cre@@ eping the core of the matter , but know what ? the children &apos;s marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now , and that is worth every price .
while A@@ bel Jackson &apos;s opinion was , it was definitely long enough to establish the practice was Lara Qu@@ entr@@ alle @-@ Thomas over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come :
public Status @-@ Update on Facebook von Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which reports : , , Her@@ vor@@ rag@@ ing News !
the sp@@ elt has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
following Mut@@ ota that belonged to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group , which was quite openly about how important the adoption of the law were noted :
the hei@@ gh@@ ing age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the age of 18 .
the draft amending the spouse has been approved today , on 9 June 2017 .
in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 members and of which were present in the vote .
all members that were agreed upon , have agreed for the law .
the children &apos;s marriage is no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ dents .
many thanks to all activists who have led him out .
Con@@ gr@@ ats .
a thank you to our members .
yet a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , therefore , the Secretary General of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a few months Mahar@@ aja has proclaimed his intention of taking judicial steps , the law should be adopted and he seems to be his promises now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the general @-@ state @-@ General Paris Al @-@ wi , a advoc@@ acy of the law , said it is quite un@@ law@@ ful if Mahar@@ aj wanted to proceed to the law , the most social media users would like to address the debate on the subject differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rell proposed in front of :
rather sat , when we take place instead of discussing the discussion so general , in a way that would invite the state into our bedrooms , &quot; simply specifically advised that the state to preserve our daughters , that they may have been beneficial to them , &quot; if you are ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
yet whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s he@@ h is legal or continue to be the norm , although there are laws that they are under@@ taking .

to China , Turkey is the most famous country in the world when it comes to massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to be blocked , there are now several mir@@ rors ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
one solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform created all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alised Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer @-@ network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator links ) which does not base itself on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship difficult .
the content is not available in spite of legal pro@@ hibition .
in a blog@@ post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
since we have heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything to set Snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the content on de@@ centralized and distributed way .
this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wiki@@ pedi@@ a.org themselves .
IP@@ FS was also assumed that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation , and it is merely taking screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the web page .

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos he saw around herself , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ ry with badly positioned mot@@ if@@ s and mature colors .
the motivated himself to carry him a camera with himself and try to understand the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar is seeking to bring Sag@@ ar , Nept@@ une to the international scene .
and his homeland right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos , which direct the attention to Nept@@ une &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook , how it helps him to get this prime location in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographers ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly myself was re@@ born in Navar@@ re@@ am ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river a leop@@ ard would be a leop@@ ard .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I went out with my camera and was in a few minutes there .
my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the Leopard was and I immediately began to cr@@ ac@@ kling pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar is seeking cooperation with the authorities to attain global recognition for Nept@@ une nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as fear@@ less as they look .
and he should know it , for he stood Tig@@ ers already from face to face .
a tiger can not be bot@@ her@@ ed by the opinion of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
even I was on the way home because of the darkness was on the way home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ f@@ ty appeared . he immediately goes away , we see ourselves and he felt st@@ ained by the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar is the logo &quot; I click for &quot; ( lit . : I cli@@ des on environmental protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nept@@ une &apos;s nature and wild animals is not always easy .
he wa@@ ited 22 days long , and usually lived in a tent to take in the Bar@@ dia National Park recording of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it took until he took a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist .
look at some of these photos below .

this article was dra@@ fted by Kay@@ ona@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally published on Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organization from India .
a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women avoid with the utmost care to speak the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Father of my child &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hatt@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Prad@@ esh give women to respect that they should respect the husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences they should ab@@ ide by the norm that practice in life .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned to the Indian state of O@@ proph@@ a by a head@@ dish , and rejected by her family and the vill@@ agers after they had raised their relatives by name .
the tradition their wives are likewise common not by name , is also common among men . however , they have far less to fear to fear if at all , they should not be able to experience this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health professionals , as well as house@@ wives , a unique club , and thus quickly became the main ch@@ rom@@ atic theme of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the int@@ ric@@ acies of the patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as one of 56 clubs that there are in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the community of Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers and is committed to the dismant@@ ling of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to un@@ cover practices , such as children &apos;s marriage up to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS infection , and guides these clubs .
she tells about how these clubs created a safe place for these women and they have made them king in the midst of amb@@ ass@@ esses .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini was shown in its panel discussion , acted by women who do not name their hus@@ bands out of name .
she decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation over the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the name of their hus@@ bands do not speak loud , a Br@@ uns , that they all maintain all duties and never questioned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini writes :
this tradition test@@ i@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not keep this one , is regarded as being depos@@ ited , as a woman without mor@@ ality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted , that we have never made thoughts about this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never had her husband never seen in the name , to try at home like it &apos;s going .
she showed the video of the panel discussion of her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
botan@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband slept long , after the video was ended .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me around and said , I can name him from now on his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage started Roh@@ ini had their first discussion .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that there was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem at U@@ tt@@ ar Prad@@ esh .
after the video projection the women tried to bring discussion with a exercise in motion .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different emotions - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked all the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we can not say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want , means that they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of her husband over the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the Bre@@ ast of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women could never speak out the name of their hus@@ bands .
botan@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that she went forth throughout the exercise just before him ; another decided to allow the whole to di@@ m@@ ess fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
even in adren@@ aline in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation about to have broken with an ancient br@@ ine , the women decided that they would really try to name their hus@@ bands in the name .
and they stopped their word .
in the next days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband called a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put into his head : his wife could not stop telling his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the entire family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she was rigi@@ d , she got fear and said that there was an error .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I shall do it . &quot;
a husband to participate in was less understanding and the situation generated in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women tried to stop other practices , such as the wearing of galvan@@ ization red points on the forehead , which indicates the sp@@ est@@ atus :
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would wear the galvan@@ ised red point , if he did it also . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he just laugh@@ ed and I heard that to wear it .
the other women have not completely heard completely , but my , they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it in some days .
for many women the discussion is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do a trip with every discussion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
usually , we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want the women to worry who what could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last few months her life celeb@@ rates her own birth@@ days with cakes ; they d@@ anced and talking about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I also have about some things , for example , how our ident@@ ities have been knot@@ ted to our hus@@ bands , never so honest .
it feels great to say certain things according to say , no matter how small they occur .
in a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have been carried only Sar@@ is since their Savi@@ our .
for most it &apos;s okay , but some wanted a sal@@ ine @-@ Kur@@ ta , a vast shirt about a tro@@ users , wear ; they did not get .
after a lot of arguments and discussion about the advantages of one &apos;s clothes , mor@@ als linked to the sar@@ is and much more , mu@@ g@@ gel@@ te Roh@@ ini her own pair of courses ( Upper hem@@ den ) into a panel discussion , so that the women could wear them .
next they have now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where you can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure to manage it .
on the question , whether in the five months since its first discussion , had changed something , the raw materials confirmed that things are slowly coming into roles :
we have only made little steps so far .
some women tried it a few times , but then heard again to say the name of their spouse .
some , including me , do it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there .
only one or two will continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women are wearing at any time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
the women in the discussion club know that changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the f@@ las@@ hing for more freedom of movement or clothes - at the end of a hard to navigate the river .
by giving each other self confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how raw ini explained :
every one of us is a victim of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also .
but this club gives each one of us confidence that will change something .
and I know that it is not only confin@@ ed to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when each woman goes home and other individuals who talk about what we are talking about and what we do .
we are all in the same boat .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this led to the UN in the South African country to investigate a mission in order to investigate this practice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania where the government developed campaigns to fight these super@@ st@@ itions and prejudi@@ ces .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the impro@@ per Chinese dis@@ si@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer in late June had announced that he has been supplied to hospital for liver cancer .
in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state je@@ ure ) , after having placed himself on the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that the democratic reforms in China had demands .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the State Department in China has called Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal affair &quot; and tells a speaker , he did not notice it as &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
however , China continues to meet calls from the international community , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , fre@@ eing or allow him treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ized strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have fully exploited the issue .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
united nations
time Ra @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese official in order to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a nar@@ rator should reject it whether the United Nations should put pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad to allow treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Norway &apos;s Norway
Nor@@ gens Prime Minister of Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ enden have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway were dou@@ bling , after the Nobel Prize 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian Government was able to conclude that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision .
the diplomatic relations were continued only in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the sal@@ v@@ ings after China since the exports have been blocked since 2010 .
after the message had spread that Li@@ u had seriously fallen seriously , the Nobel @-@ committee brought his hope in an unconditional release expressed and lu@@ d Li@@ u , to pick his prize in Oslo .
due to its det@@ ention he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution in which China was promp@@ ted to liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house ar@@ rest and allow him to seek medical assistance , where he wants .
the EU &apos;s leading diplom@@ ats of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for release Li@@ us on how to release it in a statement on June 30 :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members .
they should meet and receive all the visits , which they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States - United States
&quot; &quot; &quot; us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad informed that the Americans would like to wish him that he may have the opportunity to treat abroad , in so far as it may help him with his gen@@ esis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a speech in the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , gave the message &apos; AF@@ P on June 27th , announced that the message of the Chinese authorities &apos; urge not only to release ay , but also to liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house ar@@ rest .
the call of the U.S. message passed an angry response from China to itself , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country has the right to interven@@ ing and ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley informed that China should offer the following following :
protection and freedom such as travel security and access to medical supplies of its choice , to which they have to be according to Chinese Constitution and judicial system as well as international obligations .
the U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have just introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to push for Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I urge China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate of Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that he can enter into proper medical treatment . ht@@ tp : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o

Li@@ us attorney told AF@@ P before that Li@@ us wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police always super@@ vised the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk with someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells about :
Canada calls for China to share his international human rights obligations , including free speech , to maintain and release the exercise of these rights in cap@@ tivity .

it is my belief that the initiatives that he took and for whom he was rigor@@ ously pun@@ ished to have led to a harmon@@ ious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn had contributed to a peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and the rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem sil@@ ly , as Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state .
but according to the Justice Minister K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Singapore should be considered as a city .
this remark in the blog@@ osph@@ ere has triggered a debate .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Office of the State of New York , the Minister noted that many people critic@@ ized the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , because it is compared with other countries in Singapore .
he support that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a Democracy ...
this is where most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we may be different .
we are a city .
we are not a land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the judicial Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rot@@ ate logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacri@@ fic@@ s to create this valuable land you can say that we are not in no country .
it so@@ unded as vul@@ gar , it had the sem@@ blan@@ ce of a flight before the responsibilities , a must @-@ breaking .
Singapore , if you are not my country , and eating land is it then ?
the reasons for Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am led reasons were not very no@@ bles : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries , given the one , it appeared in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic .
but he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently managed by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core point of the topic , the good old ly@@ re emerg@@ es from the author@@ it@@ arian rulers to be instruc@@ ted democr@@ ats , leave the twi@@ sted logic , since they adap@@ ts better to their power .
in the end of the final week of Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am there were given answers to his American guests with regard to our press , our Ju@@ rist@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ responses .
corresponding questions clo@@ aked it with non @-@ answer type .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am to illustrate his opinion as they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
when Singapore is no country , but a city is , thus to which country belongs to our city ...
in short , I understand nothing .
I would be very thankful if our wer@@ ter K Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take the effort to clarify this point unless it was paid high in order to be part of the government of the City of Singapore .
by reading his comments on the blog , he points to the reviews that you should begin to read the entire co @-@ ordin@@ ating of the conference so that you can better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am better , according to which Singapore is a city and no country .
read the trans@@ cript .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore should be so un@@ equally important , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is living in Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party in decades of decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously does not mean in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , which makes as a leader of a growing generation , such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am over what the Just@@ in Minister of Singapore has said , very embarrass@@ ed ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the ancient Gar@@ de which I expect - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he &apos;s really believed , correctly associated and aware of what he def@@ ends .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review dis@@ connects the weaknesses of Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am Arg@@ umenten
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; goo@@ gling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has committed a mistake , or was it a mis@@ cre@@ ant speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is no country , we are only seen as an independent and sovereig@@ n state ?
if not , on which country do the sovereig@@ n Rights of the City of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the ruling party , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ gr@@ am are of serious importance .
why do the Singapur form their military service , do they only defend their city but not their country ?
whom does our Prime Minister have to pay b@@ ills ?
what is the value of our pink recruitment ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
, the magazine Jour@@ ney of a decade to the affir@@ mation , Singapore is and always was a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this proposition seems to have become anno@@ yed for many communities ...
nobody ever has said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island nation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defence of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but this is not quite true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the myth of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cute Kan@@ adi@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed flan@@ ders .
screens@@ hot of a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editor : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your homeland or homeland ?
your answers will be published here as part of a continuous series , with the rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world face and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ is Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question which is most posed to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I then come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I am living there and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is regarded as polite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ or by giving personal questions .
on my clar@@ inets then usually follows the basic response : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ic@@ ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many can@@ adi@@ er cook maybe inter@@ r@@ war@@ dly in front of W@@ ut when they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t distur@@ b this .
for someone who does not know himself , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Canadian from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans make a can@@ adi@@ c banner clearly visible at their back@@ pack when they &apos;re travelling .
all love Kan@@ adi@@ er .
Americans on the other hand ... .
it was also when I began 20 years ago to travel through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and the 11th of September .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le sheets at their luggage to differ from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
there is no weapons with us !
gender equality in Canada has been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are polite .
we obviously say very often &quot; exc@@ use . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada is alle@@ ged@@ ly said to be the most toler@@ ant country opposite ethnic groups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are not like these types south of the border .
we can@@ adi@@ er are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends , which I have very ad@@ mi@@ red .
I would do nothing if you would go to Dallas to Dallas to his example with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the p@@ unch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; first : being referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said basically , sp@@ icious , gentle , but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Simp@@ son &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( who has a separate Canadian double ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Canada really had a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; no personality has .
there are no corners and edges , nothing that can come across .
harmless to be in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and do not deserve attention .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around one .
I would even go back to say that the desire to be free and alone is a main body of the Canadian .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
what out@@ si@@ ders as &quot; nice &quot; call , maybe simply cool courtesy .
Canadi@@ ans do not often talk about the neighbors with the neighbors .
we are missing the warm @-@ heart@@ ed , open friendliness that I joined with my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Just@@ in Tru@@ deau die stage , to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada straight to sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ Band par@@ o@@ ert Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand the pop @-@ band has released a music video which took over the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 , and in spite of their promises , restoring the civilian government , continues to re@@ igns the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det girl ) of the band Tattoo Col@@ our describes a young man who told what regulations makes him his girlfriend .
although not expressly political , the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band has been praised by many fans and other websites for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video of the song was a great success .
only during the first three days that was shared on Facebook up@@ loaded video 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last month , the Charlie @-@ Chap@@ lin &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand since a group of activists called the public to watch this video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai policies , special about how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the jun@@ k rule .
look at the videos of the video which refer to some of the political issues that Thailand has been pursuing in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refer to the dra@@ stic section of 44 of the pro@@ visional constitution resulting in the superi@@ ority holder of the He@@ eres absolute decision @-@ making authority over important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; setup change &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by journalists , students , activists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are regarded by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image above reflects the introduction of the Law on Computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to prosec@@ ute activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army , monitors the online content and people whom pre @-@ accused , the monarchy will have deteri@@ or@@ ated and prosec@@ uted .
Thailand is set a stri@@ ley against &quot; read Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic ) .
on 20 May 2014 in Thailand the war was declared .
two days later it was a put@@ sch of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to persec@@ ute is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ marine , although security experts they war@@ n that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax funds .
in the video even shows how people are thrown into a black supplier before taking them into an inter@@ rup@@ tive camp , another problem occurs .
some journalists are in prison , because it supp@@ os@@ edly causes &quot; confusion &quot; in society and internet users will be threatened long det@@ ention , they should off@@ end the monarchy .
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song members of the band , who took the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; who was already used by put@@ sch @-@ opponents during the 2014 protests .
life goes on into the ruins of the gh@@ ost cities in eastern waste .

the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society is only very slow in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al district .
it has now been over 20 years , since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ hic war has been officially completed , but his fo@@ ols are still highly visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern districts in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the coal @-@ bas@@ ins of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , shut@@ ters , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ian lived and worked together to sovi@@ ets in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , the majority of Russians and deport@@ ations live in the area .
such settlements are also referred to in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia as well as spirit @-@ cities .
in the pre @-@ war era , more than 10,000 people lived here today , there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost cities .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the 16.@@ 000 people had risen more than a decade ago .
in 1989 some 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ story housing blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , called the hr@@ ush@@ che@@ uk@@ kas are symbo@@ lic@@ ally stand for the decline and the devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are falling apart and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native guy .
he begins a conversation and it falls him hard to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why ?
it is still clear . &quot;
in front of the war the village was full of life .
there were municipal centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , all of the community .
now , there are only paved road with f@@ las@@ hing spl@@ end@@ or buildings .
the people that once lived in this place and contributed their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union , have now left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha about fifty inhabitants .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the hr@@ ush@@ che@@ ow@@ ka , which are still one or two families , one can recognize in the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when she came to the camera with the camera , they immediately move back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother is forbidden to let us photograph , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you simply has forbidden it , that is all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pered something to her girlfriend and suddenly they left the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish @-@ Turkish company called T@@ ku@@ archi@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence farming ( cultivation of agricultural products for the own needs ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable @-@ growing .
it is difficult to come across the laps .
the District administration supplies free candles in winter and bread to the villages .

about ten years ago an older woman moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ k@@ ha .
despite their oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left before Ab@@ ch@@ asi@@ as to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina does not want to accept financial aid from her daughter and insist that she is supporting her young grand@@ son .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly pension are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; she gives .
a@@ unt G@@ alya tells that she and other vill@@ agers attempt to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
if holidays are , we visit us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot constantly do this - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neigh@@ bor appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ asch@@ a , &quot; calls T@@ ante G@@ alya her to . &quot; They said we could join Zu@@ cch@@ ini .
I already prepared the floor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what is going to happen , but we will join the cour@@ get@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as Party ( Nat@@ asch@@ a ) has lived together with her husband and the five common children in their house for some time .
Nat@@ asch@@ a was 11 years old when the war began .
every day it reminds itself of the village @-@ life in front of the war .
despite the relatives , which live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the Land Ab@@ ch@@ Asia , simply left ) , they had not the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we recently purchased land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative trial in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
we want to build a house there , but it will still take a little &apos; , explaining it .
Nat@@ asch@@ a receives about $ 9 children for each child .
your man works in the Koh@@ leng@@ pit .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house , where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was , keeping them pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
it told that at first it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time they lost their fears .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that this buildings were destroyed during the war .
indeed , it has to do something with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
I remember every day the city and the war once were . &quot;
as our conversation incl@@ ined to the end , a little boy will be over us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hiding .
a ball flies from the window and another boy j@@ agt also behind him .
he plays with the ball , who then desc@@ ends the hill .
a group of children now follows the ball .
while they run , some of them are stones at the devast@@ ated buildings .
these ruins are a part of their childhood , which care for uncertainty in their lives .
you do not know it otherwise .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the road of migrants that Europe or Latin America cross , some places are known for their hospitality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is run by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mex@@ ik@@ an@@ erin , a small woman with a basket and g@@ ild@@ ed ear @-@ rings in Ted@@ dy@@ b@@ ären form .
it is called Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in tap@@ e@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know a lot under the name of Mama Africa .
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on the journey .
the hotel has no less charm .
for about 2,50 Dollar per night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with k@@ ills , br@@ itt@@ y walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a c@@ age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haiti &apos;s migrants are coming here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes , Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells the people in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at present it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept on cardboard boxes .
it does not want to reject anyone .
she also helps them and bring them to hospital when they are sick , they bu@@ ys them drugs that they cannot pay , they massive them with a bal@@ m that ring off the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , is recently arrived .
I asked him if Mama Africa is a reasonable nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a Jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) posi@@ ert with Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ aking .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; says he with a smile . &quot; I really feel it fits to her as African women are very nice women .
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard of other be@@ ers of Mama Afrika . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ in , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells that the Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ cans often travel the distance and that Afri@@ cans speak to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
how many of his companions has lived Michel@@ in beforehand in Brazil and worked as a construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was we@@ aker , he started his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest in Mama Africa for months : he sold SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bu@@ sti@@ et after Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will contact Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave them again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in contact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells us that their guests often send her messages , when they went to kiss her or to report her about the course of their journey .
she declar@@ es that her Christian faith was the drive of her work .
she does not know much about Africa , but their guests have brought her to bring chicken as in Ghana .
Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but she is not the only spark hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the town , a dead @-@ end street leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter in Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family were migrants in their small house .
it is a polic@@ eman a polic@@ eman and found that the pen@@ gu@@ ets are sold to many African migrants to be too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar per night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleep on blan@@ kets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking area outdoors .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declar@@ es that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I experienced what they experience .
I crossed the border crossing the wilderness and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . this is the reason why I give them my assistance . &quot;
after having lived three years , he was referred to a raid on his work place from the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez told me that he fled to people with his wife and three children who wanted to squee@@ ze the money from him without a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and a unknown , a single educ@@ ator , has offered him its roof .
several months later the family still lives and they tried to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Afrika , everything is full of guests .
in the courses the travelers consult their phones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large majority of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seemed happy that her house is full , but she is also a no@@ stal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother , she is fil@@ tered in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair we@@ ave , which has made her a sp@@ er , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travellers more , boy and Old .
they lau@@ gh sad , while she pre@@ faces me briefly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; repeatedly says it . &quot; They are already gone . &quot;

on 10 July the mobile users at the Tian@@ shan District , the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a cell notification in which it has to install the District Government , a surveillance app called Jing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Communication , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to keep access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , k@@ ò@@ n@@ n the authorities use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonom@@ ous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture , because shortly after they had the app to install messages with a private We@@ aver group .
in the communication of the police , the app would determine the sources and the distribution of terrorists , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
Jing@@ w@@ ang website describes the app as follows :
Jing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main function is the block@@ ade porno@@ graphic web pages , from online sc@@ am , Tro@@ jan@@ ers and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to remot@@ ely control their own home network .
this app with fil@@ tering for min@@ ors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these features can naturally be used in many different ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ acker can enable the home network to manipul@@ ate or ste@@ al it from it .
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while messages about digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship primarily focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often ble@@ ak for those who live in distant , pressing ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme ups and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ ing internet de@@ activ@@ ations .
the findings of Twitter @-@ Out@@ let &quot; Images from the mainland China &quot; ( call@@ back home ) , the cen@@ sored messages in China released , showed photos of a check@@ point , at the police officers &quot; subsequently transferred if they had the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure the people use the official Jing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile alert indic@@ ating that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a back@@ bone for the technological development .
they have the people forced to use devices that are intended for older people to use .
this is a form of cap@@ tivity through the observ@@ atory technology .
we are back in ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from the mainland China &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) published also a Jing@@ w@@ ang product description , out of which the software can up@@ lift the password &apos;s requirement of a Windows operating system , thus receiving unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the installation of Jing@@ w@@ ang , computers and Hand@@ ys in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become an electronic handic@@ ap .
the regulations in Jing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City of Party Council , to minimize the circulation of illegal contents .
all government agencies , government agencies and related institutions including universities and research institutes are oblig@@ ated to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office during operation of their computers and communication devices .
a later report of Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned this new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi announced a regulation to all residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August their &quot; personal ID maps , manual , external drives , not@@ ebooks , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; register with the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos , &quot; however , this action does hurt the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for quite a number of other possible dec@@ eption , including those that relate to peaceful religious or political notes .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything fri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane writes its experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world you look at yourself and tell you that you &apos;re totally alone in one place where everything has gone forever .
everything has gradually been resolved , and reveals a truth which is clearly recogni@@ z@@ able , both inside and outside .
one which makes her name all glory .
one which has put down in a list of feelings and expres@@ sions that has no met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when you catch the reality again and you are looking back behind the scenes - beyond actors , the beautiful scen@@ eries and the performer - the characters in nature are transformed into flesh and blood , and everything falls upon death .
all doubts be resolved in R@@ auch , and you will be aware of your existence , even though the earth are on the axis of the we@@ dge . you will realize that you are caught up between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone built around stone .
they took me and my father thre@@ e@@ times , but I don &apos;t know yet so that I mean &quot; my L@@ ess@@ on , &quot; as the boss of the Security Services , it was form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure .
he presented his power over us , by even destro@@ ying the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five young people were tor@@ n during a peaceful protests such as we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it took out so that the city sh@@ out the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ an Ak@@ bar &quot; cry .
all urban district co@@ v@@ eted , just my own not .
for the first time , it was quiet , rainy , at the wrong time , even if I didn &apos;t put high demands on a city that had stopped to the arter@@ ies with state security , and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down something after the power supply in the quarter stopped to work .
I broke the silence , by conf@@ using several times &quot; All@@ ahu &quot; from my Haus@@ d@@ ach .
I heard my voice ref@@ unding through the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends were cour@@ ageous enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we conc@@ eive ourselves to a pra@@ ising picture that fully met my expectations .
in such a moment you are aware that you free the spirit from the lamp , but it is not just interested in the beginning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; makes you ready , we meet in the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low , nothing can give you your voice , after you have mel@@ ted them all the way up to the office of the security service .
I came there .
the thir@@ st gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ober@@ st gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; let &apos;s also hear me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or you are just cour@@ ageous enough to cry out if we are not nearby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his ugly eyes set up for me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you feel really something to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was on my door@@ way , van@@ ity , and perhaps at the revolution .
I was so sure when I said , &quot; I did not think you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I never ceased to look into your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me and yet I don &apos;t regret any word from what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular and his Father is equal to them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is equal to this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gest@@ ive of this dist@@ orted set lies down to the present day in the nose .
he became a &apos; syndrome , &quot; a spiritual torture that I was subjected to monthly message .
I terri@@ fy the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I am with me .
afterwards again through the yard and into the second office , which leads through a gear to the single cells .
I pre@@ di@@ ct the details exactly before I support the room .
otherwise they probably got a larger cell to me this time .
I have to share them with only one single det@@ ain@@ ees and may immediately put me immedi@@ at@@ ly , without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I sat down on an old @-@ established communication method : to hit the wall with the f@@ ist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my z@@ g@@ umm@@ ers was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation , he rep@@ lied to me ultimately .
apparently lay in none of the surrounding cells a respec@@ table middle aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the complete darkness do not let me know a distinctive face , and doctors are not there ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like my sounds ? &quot;
all the answers are connected .
perhaps he got into one of the great cells .
perhaps he will list@@ ens right away .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would love him if I stay .
li@@ ar .
I would like to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to rep@@ el all these cro@@ ws , which are lab@@ elled at the fruits in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I still hear them &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ende Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always around this time the cry , every day .
the door opens itself .
I was always convinced that black saw the colour of understanding , until I saw the yellow light that presented us to the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ spiel@@ ung on 13 S@@ ure des Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; they are here to be questioned . &quot;
this was the secret to protect the security of us : to protect the state security in front of us , and to avoid the tra@@ itors and the terrorists in us , they talk in the al@@ a@@ wit@@ tic dial@@ ect - thus they played their denomin@@ ational black@@ board and betra@@ yed the narrow perspectives of their world view .
this is not a house that is here is not a land ; it is a cur@@ se that they call co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of its k@@ lan@@ s into a hero .
I super@@ vised the audi@@ ences and meet in Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender and disgu@@ sting man ; at least he is coming in front of me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he begins a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; despite the facial expres@@ sions : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can begin as much more important with your life when you join this Tag@@ edi@@ ger and protest to demonstrations that will soon be an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I rep@@ lied .
I acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to not answer .
I can really no longer say exactly when ins@@ ults and b@@ lows after a friendly conversation for me to become an ordinary communication means .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I was at ease or arous@@ ed to get used to be pun@@ ished , although I did nothing to make this punishment .
in punishment in all its diversity .
its command is to pl@@ uck me as much meat as possible of the body .
he is called the lov@@ ingly &quot; Gest@@ än@@ d@@ nis . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe , which probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your hen@@ ker rejo@@ ic@@ ed in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him and you cannot with@@ hold your cry .
my scre@@ ams did not give him enough , why they re@@ plac@@ eable the pipe by a cable .
during my first feast , I wonder@@ ed whether the investig@@ ator worked as a gar@@ bage dump or whether it belonged to the normal working space .
they had four cables to inter@@ f@@ ere with each other , to present us from their perspective , great invention of a huge cab@@ els .
within a single hour they are often mist@@ aken three of them while I was still at the series .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped to cry .
the ex@@ ecu@@ tion@@ er re@@ marked the cooling and did not find a favor , which is why he purchased as a neighbour to an electric loaded st@@ aff@@ le .
flow through my whole body , enough to feed my entire quarter .
my semi @-@ naked body that lay down on the ground was the perfect power manager .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
it must have been so at midnight .
I decided to lay down again , let &apos;s say that was my only option .
several hours passed , that came to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning fills the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answered with the voice of an in@@ exhau@@ stive young people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be fear@@ ful concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be silent and mot@@ ed you , you will be ref@@ unded . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the J@@ ord@@ an Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b covers the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smok@@ es a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b spends much of his time inside ; sometimes he s@@ ander to his canvas , to his computer , and once again to his couch .
but what you can leave is a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or his nic@@ otine to discover lips .
he lives in the top of his family house , which belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel was completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family were forced to fle@@ e from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as fel@@ i@@ ye@@ en ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for six years H@@ ath@@ ai@@ b is a passionate activ@@ ist who presents itself to the conservative majority and questioned their alt@@ proven opinions on gender issues , sexuality and freedom of expression through art and Rap@@ music . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his music , who often deals with issues such as orient@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues do not only be found in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ ance but also in cities that are rich in Damascus by far to San@@ aa in Y@@ emen .
with its 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as a man who has not restricted in his mind by borders , and he may mit@@ ig@@ ate the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Y@@ emen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not give it openly , he defeated a particular dis@@ incl@@ ination against the US @-@ American foreign policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b looks for his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his sympathy goes to those who try to do in war areas , something to do with its identity as a &apos; Palestinian f@@ ray of the second generation - so he called himself , even if he was born in Jordan and never was in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not think about my own lives , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed H@@ ash@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he adds : &quot; I think that because I am a man , &quot; while he sho@@ ok in water with this Nes@@ café in two cups ; it &apos;s the holy month of Ram@@ adan . in this time it is planned for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset .
the j@@ ord@@ ian law also states that the public intake of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness for it to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ es@@ cent hot jun@@ k has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the mud@@ dy warm coffee and the swe@@ eter of the K@@ ent @-@ cigar@@ ette in the nose , first and foremost of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when looking into neighbouring countries .
therefore , one avo@@ ids to do basic things - to drink basic things - just as they drink in the public during Ram@@ adan , not to land in prison .
recently , the House of Jord@@ an@@ iens has cancelled an appearance of the band M@@ ash@@ rou &apos; Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some parliament@@ arians who support the Islamic Action front - the j@@ ord@@ an branch of the Muslim Br@@ otherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of hom@@ osex@@ ual in@@ cis@@ ers Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contradi@@ cts the cultural and traditional standards of the country and be the main reason for concert coll@@ usion .
the MP and former spokes@@ person in the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that was told the concert &quot; just &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the S@@ ang@@ aro@@ o .
many argue that the involvement of the band in affairs such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world be dangerous acti@@ vis@@ m that questioned the Ancient @-@ proven legitimacy of author@@ it@@ arian regimes in the entire region .
in a public statement M@@ ash@@ rou &apos; Lei@@ la the j@@ ord@@ ian people as &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights , &quot; which continue to use &quot; for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement may not be simply prob@@ ed in Rh@@ et@@ oric , but actually a clearly reflected in cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan which occurs in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work clearly .
in 2016 , H@@ ev@@ ai@@ b traditional sex men led to Lei@@ be by creating his vision of the fate of Arab women who have vo@@ re@@ hel@@ i@@ chen sex .
the image shows the sk@@ elet@@ on of an apparently dist@@ orted lady , their arms and legs down to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those they actually should trust .
over the past few years , the number of &apos; honour mor@@ de &apos; has increased - the un@@ official outside is left intact .
human Rights Watch predicted the number of winners in 2016 in 2016 ; however , it is still horri@@ fic that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to assist women who tried victims of murder or domestic violence in order to provide appropriate manner .
according to a law on the ground control by the year 1954 , women who are exposed to the risk of inner @-@ family violence , &quot; and for her release is often a years of bureaucr@@ atic effort as well as the guarantee from the family necessary that the woman has nothing to happen .
too H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music is very popular with popularity and is known for it , not to be back in front of issues that are long standing in his country as tab@@ u .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is argu@@ ed that his work is political , but is a fact that he is his music , who is full of explicit ass@@ essm@@ ents on sexuality , freedom and expression , does not separate from politics .
&quot; I come from the Ne@@ ar East , Man .
to me politics was born , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of the songs , which are in the core of political will be further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated many times :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is also . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market in which one can get in his words , &quot; what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , Het@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he noticed that hardly any someone talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still heavily cen@@ sored until 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b introduced an interview for the popular J@@ ord@@ an On@@ line@@ age Ro@@ ya , to later notice that his comments from the context was tor@@ n , dist@@ orted and his opinion were cen@@ sored .
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but has been only a working version , &quot; he says .
today H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that int@@ ri@@ ance to homosexu@@ als do not speak to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ ke , a poet of the eigh@@ th century , who still has stayed in memory today thanks to its hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ something that was later to work on behalf of the calibr@@ ation , in the eigh@@ teenth century could openly write about homosexu@@ ality , why can I do that ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ rou &apos; Lei@@ la , or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the ha@@ schem@@ atic realm there is nothing new that the government has sanc@@ tioned on freedom of expression and that progressive voices will be sil@@ enced .
still recently , in January 2017 , the Jav@@ anese news service held several former government officials and members of the teacher , with the reason they have expressed themselves on comments in social media and related to the problems that were deeply rooted in the Land with the deep within the country .
given its view , the concert of H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs believes that only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to bring structural changes in the next generation of the Jordan .
for him , progress is a continuous giving and taking . Jordan has re@@ vered M@@ ash@@ rou &apos; Lei@@ la now for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - it looks long , precious and inner changes . it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the j@@ ord@@ an Society .
ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , also from an Arab world without interventions from abroad .
he dre@@ amed of doing his work until Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of what they experience . &quot;
perhaps the region is going through the use of music , art and literature a genuine and basic openness - and not by bom@@ bs , spreading and arti@@ fic@@ i@@ ally manner . at least , he hopes that .
until the end of this , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will res@@ old and therefore also res@@ ist .

Neb@@ uta to A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these great , ex@@ travag@@ ant war@@ ri@@ ffs are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
one suspected that it is celebrated a variant of Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival that is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ cus . a further theory asser@@ ts that the drums and dancing over more than a thousand years have been handed over and from a time come to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi to force in the kne@@ es .
we are at the L@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could grab some great seats , so we have a super sight .
you can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ el@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I watched the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ o@@ en for a long time : two stron@@ gh@@ old are straight to see .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ ula Festival is the only true one - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and looked at the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high car was amazing .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely there were ou@@ trag@@ eous phenomenon and body care as important as in this story , for they help out away from the Peru@@ vian youth from crimin@@ ality and to promote a legitimate profession like the of the Fris@@ eurs .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us principal port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where stre@@ et@@ b and illegal drugs are daily .
in April 2017 , a survey showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region may not be safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sport@@ s@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to develop more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ styles , who can trace these elaborate hair@@ styles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , who go to the outer limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been held since 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are experts among each other to show who can create the ex@@ cre@@ ti@@ est L@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( other videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who found themselves in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to take young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of spending a training in hair@@ dressing art , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered have do@@ zens of young@@ sters seeing that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops prior to the school year in March , reported on some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only school in the community and district where we are very proud , because of love for the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love @-@ letters on gu@@ err@@ illa

the following article is the revised version of the Beit@@ rag@@ s &quot; Liebes@@ bot@@ cies &quot; gu@@ err@@ illa &quot; which has released the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
this article will be published as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write just love @-@ letters to people we know ?
is it not yet much more important , people who make themselves tr@@ apped to do affection ?
exactly this question went to the two young Colom@@ bian activists from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth @-@ Stiftung not anymore from the head and inspired it to the campaign Cart@@ as por la Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ li@@ ación ( letters for reconciliation ) , the young people were killed , gu@@ err@@ illas , gu@@ err@@ illas letters .
only recently , her land was a place of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to its part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had a peace treaty with the Guer@@ ill@@ ab@@ we@@ ation F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces in Columbus ) , which forms the s@@ cap@@ tion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
international saw the submission of the peace treaty , as important that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos received his mer@@ its for his mer@@ its to Nobel Peace Prize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a long way to be able to speak of a true reconciliation and peace . &quot; &quot; &quot;
gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who have lived for many years in illegal camps , were exposed to a war rh@@ et@@ oric , and around the clock their weapons , must now be restored to life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society in turn , which had used to live in constant fear and in some cases deeply hat@@ red against err@@ illa war@@ ns , they have to record them in their ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bian needs to join forces and would need to help in the integration process .
and that is exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in society .
the goal of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for any former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters - that should be handed over personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters for reconciliation was carried out at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize , which took place in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ á . there , Leonardo and Crist@@ ian had the opportunity to speak shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize at 2014 .
this explained that we love the people we love , on Valentine &apos;s thousands of love writing , but those forget that they need much nic@@ er .
he qu@@ ad , he re@@ tired , to share his love with people this year , which necess@@ it@@ ates the most urgent response .
thus , the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former war@@ ri@@ ors of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and to build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian company is willing to make the dis@@ course of a war history to a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
up to date , more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major towns of Columbus such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first 500 letters were handed over in one of the UN &apos;s warehouse in the Cal@@ don@@ o region in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
a group of 40 students at the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city council of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art traveled in the camp to give letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC rated as they had done earlier in order to face the prec@@ ep@@ ts of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of sub @-@ care of people from all over the country .
it was a very event@@ ful moment for all parties involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that da@@ between lies , &quot; the political knowledge of Manuela Jim@@ é@@ nez Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a co @-@ assistant of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience :
after we had passed the letters , me led me a former war@@ ri@@ or through the camp of the gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ ri@@ ors .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ck &quot; ( a kind of cabin , where the err@@ illa fighters live ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down , because beside him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ eg@@ cher , a deadly weapon in the Dorn@@ rö@@ schen@@ schl@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said to him yet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answered on a letter that someone has written me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never in my life someone has written something so nice , so I response to it . &quot; I suddenly gave me the tears over the che@@ eks .
I strongly im@@ pover@@ ished it completely and set me next to the pom@@ eg@@ ectors .
perhaps he was tired of p@@ ity , I was tired of having all the years of faithful companion of this fighters , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC , the only way to preserve him and his six brothers in front of the hunger to@@ d . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society out there that is waiting for us with open arms .
so far , I just learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace is igns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
for the pre@@ l@@ ude came to students and some guides of the F@@ ARC to a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC already died in the hiding place .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave an insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years have experienced how the social in@@ justice on the part of the state was emerging on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to build ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to shape the society in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a purpose of this scale , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
those people hear that had never been heard before and no voting rights , and to recognize that people who have often seen as monster and even hate who were shot by their lives and their environment was extremely painful for me .
the reality in which the country is alive , does me sore .
but it com@@ for@@ ting me that all men - even those who have killed and so much damage , let us teach us and give a smile and a hug .
many former war@@ ri@@ ors have responded to letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the com@@ mander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the town of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the Colom@@ bian@@ ern was re@@ mitt@@ edly , that after the dra@@ ining peace this would reign .
but this is not the case .
as long as there are inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to grab the weapons , rise up and to protest for their rights . and that &apos;s also completely justified ( ... ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we from the F@@ ARC rely on peace on a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why we call for all defen@@ ders of peace - regardless of which race , religion or ideology they belong to all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrif@@ ices because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those under us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

it follows the translation of an article , which was written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ owa and its initial publication on the OC Media website .
the homosexu@@ als and que@@ er men who live in the Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mailing .
with terror activists , the reporting of the last months on the persecution fluctu@@ ates men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat , which is like a dy@@ nasty over the local LGB@@ T@@ Q community depends not only at night .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny who has divided some of her experiences with us and talked to us what is currently happening in the Republic .
the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has taken over several months ago , following reports published the dis@@ cop@@ ing , torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic of them@@ at@@ ised .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gas@@ eta ; it thre@@ w a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , the dam@@ aging que@@ er men soli@@ ds and they in secret pris@@ ons in the gun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sabrina , a trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
even since her childhood she felt that she was in fact a woman .
when she was growing , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , why she moved to Moscow .
after a group ch@@ ords of the gender @-@ san@@ ction of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sabrina .
they moved out of fear for their lives in the USA .
Sabrina : I was working as an honor@@ ary hel@@ per at a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Dag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ wife that raised in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , he made a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his ch@@ est@@ rian friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate these shame ? &quot;
afterwards the photos of my documents made the round of the W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I was just trying to bring some shopping from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a Male Im@@ press : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I turned around , I sens@@ ed something in my body , but I did not hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard one sentence , but this time on the Che@@ chen : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long do you wish to rep@@ el the family ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and wo@@ ke the final end of the hospital again .
apparently some women had everything and started to cry out .
the man was flying .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two key@@ rings in my right lung wings .
OC Media : in what ambul@@ ances were you placed - in which men or women ?
Sabrina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name , but the doctor got up and put me to the women .
I am very grateful to him .
when I read his name for the first time at his office , I got it to do with the fear ; it was a Muslim , a caus@@ al name .
but he set himself as a good person .
I am grateful to him that it is respectful with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I got Dro@@ ps .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown .
this was the beginning of a night@@ club .
my family was attended by neighbors and some remote relatives .
the requested to send me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all that was a lie .
they said absurd demands : some said to me , I wanted to prove it by far without the roads ; others wanted I was in the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my gender , that all was just bad , and Photoshop .
I have body @-@ size C - what would I like to say in television ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still hard for them .
some older men spoke to my mother on the road .
they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that is not only your family , but the entire Republic .
we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she lay down a stri@@ ck around the neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , under the window there was a car with a dar@@ ken@@ ed window and a number@@ ing plate with a 95 .
once it was happened for the third time , it was clear to me that there was something la@@ zy .
my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my human rights members aud@@ ited the number depic@@ t signs - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to award its name but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the land , but then did something unbelievable .
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I just bought it , without sign me , without a reference , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and cast it into the gar@@ bage .
came and checked out into the hotel
the number was registered to a stran@@ ger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
in the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you felt not about , you are in security , just because you left the country ?
our people know already , in which hotel you st@@ eck@@ st . you even know your room@@ .
only to prove it , it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine ? !
this was actually my room @-@ number .
OC Media : do you still contact your family ?
Sabrina : just with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , we do not speak about the gender equality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , we do not speak that is a tab@@ ular topic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some traditionally c@@ au@@ c@@ asi@@ an elements I still play in me .
as much as I wish , this se@@ el@@ ic barrier can I not overcome .
I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we ch@@ att@@ ing with camera , I actually give myself to look like the person who rec@@ alls itself from their past - so to my male forms .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what are your friends , those who have remained d@@ ort@@ on ?
Sabrina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who has saved the one and a half months in the gun .
he told that while Ram@@ adan were not arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait to wait and he didn &apos;t lock out a new wave .
most likely they will focus now on family and relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , they probably invite the relatives to take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has experienced by blood satisfaction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : will you now be det@@ a@@ illed for men in these myst@@ eries ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine said , there were just not so many .
if , then especially those who have no rich relatives or have dropped out of their relatives to make a Kad@@ y@@ rows court .
as far as I know , they are held there so that you can present them later as terrorists .
say : should they be brought up , you will show your body on TV and claim they would have attacked any village or military base point .
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply van@@ ished , but sub@@ mer@@ ged in order to radic@@ alise itself .
OC Media : is this now only a fault , or do you have a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I had just someone who was det@@ ained in Ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard grown .
there was no news of them ever since .
they have simply taken them .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even when these people were taken .
until now , however , they were not presented as a band@@ its , in addition there has been no reports yet . we suppose that such actions are possible .
why else would you not have allowed these people to shave yourself ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kid@@ n@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already taken place in the past ?
Sabrina : I always carried my hair for long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known quite big , when I lived there - and I never had any problems .
in the Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the shar@@ ia was considered , I never had problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia wanted to lead us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civilian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil society , but ultimately has thrown back into the St@@ one@@ age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my eyeb@@ rows were t@@ ore ; I had st@@ ing@@ ed lashes , carried away Tub@@ ular and short T@@ ops .
the safety Ministry of Sh@@ aria has never made me a hair even more .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , a whole group of people met me .
it was a small place where several ri@@ ben@@ ches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people met there .
we have never been insul@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a phrase : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Acc@@ otto does not mean over the un@@ happiness of another . &quot;
you often say it to children if who make themselves more than sick .
OC Media : so they just have her eyes closed before you , because they believed , you are sick ?
Sabrina : yes .
they have never been insul@@ ted , never h@@ unted , and never be@@ aten .
OC Media : how long did this grace take time ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row came to the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak on television on mor@@ ality .
he did not talk about us per se , but rather on the behavior of women .
nevertheless , one could feel the people in the city started to change .
who had sm@@ iled and laugh@@ ed before , viewed you on once with suspic@@ ion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I got back home , I could feel how the situation in the Republic is steadily wor@@ mer@@ ing .
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I did not make much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
that also I am still working as an activ@@ ist .
at present I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize teac@@ up , gath@@ ers , I beg@@ ining it to the hospital and help them to get Essen@@ sk@@ arten .
I have not been a pen@@ ny for a long time .
I discovered these people themselves when I t@@ ear@@ ed the flu@@ kes .
I am Muslim and would like to help the people who need help .
OC Media : wear a Hid@@ ding@@ y ?
Sabrina : this is important .
this is the nature that has purely nothing to do with religion at all .
that is exactly the same as Ch@@ ani@@ ans who want to present you with foam in front of the mouth that there is no sw@@ amp@@ ed in them .
the Dag@@ est@@ ans have those who have Kab@@ ar@@ din@@ er who have the Russians also which ; on the whole planet there are - but not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I am from there , so it is un@@ pleasantly surprised , just what to hear .
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims who go to the mosque and fasting during the Ram@@ adan - live with men together .
do you know , many think with tran@@ sp@@ acy to men who love men , and they believe that one changes its sex to gain more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a chest .
these are two different things - two different types of sensation in order to be precise , different habitats .
for me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ash@@ amed for my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m going to be personally personally , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I am not very sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself .
local groups war@@ n of an increase of self @-@ mor@@ ants within the for@@ ged Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Irish Z@@ wa@@ z region suffer from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last few months there has been a strong rise in self @-@ mor@@ den .
the photo of the Arab worker in Iran was made available by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ sc@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 , the dist@@ ressing situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the spot@@ light .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ sc@@ z in the South@@ west of Iran .
he suffered under anxiety and depression , and he was ash@@ amed of his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , the in@@ ability for his family to come up , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ human rights groups who want to work in pedi@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
one on YouTube video held the moments after he had imagined ourselves .
some people managed to clear the fl@@ ames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was taken into the Tal@@ eg@@ ger hospital in the city of Ah@@ sc@@ z .
according to local sources , the bur@@ ns were so strong that doctors could not do anything anymore .
he died short time later .
it was not the only su@@ icide that l@@ ends itself in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and campa@@ igners war@@ n that more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights announces that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im .
their stories have a thing in common : it was all family members committed to persecution by the Iranian government , and they felt un@@ able to feed their families and to pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , located in a large part of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community , was sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to tre@@ ad its living .
in a century ago the Arabic Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predomin@@ antly autonom@@ ous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi @-@ monarchy took over power and under@@ took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in the entire Iran .
in the Ah@@ sc@@ z region there are some of the largest in Iran &apos;s oil and gas fields , as well as some of the best @-@ rich and valuable areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy is still developing slowly , and the native population does only get little of that ri@@ ches .
it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and austerity .
the Iranian regime is denied the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arabs systematically jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also builds a variety of dem@@ ons , the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lying .
these d@@ ams have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused in the region through dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy the local farming as well as fish and palm @-@ men industry .
unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ k @-@ young people now increased to 81 % .
NO@@ UR Moh@@ ammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director@@ ate , for cooperation , work and social welfare , announces that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who are looking for a job , completed my primary school , 55 % a further school ended and 45 % have university degrees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high increase &quot; in the number of self @-@ mor@@ den among the young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ men .
Doh@@ im@@ i said that especially the unemployment has become wr@@ ap@@ ly worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ancestors , newly in@@ coming ethnic and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the process of in@@ stell@@ ations :
as function@@ aries and institutions do not prefer Arab labour power , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will ent@@ ail access to work@@ places in all sectors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their living outside of their home ancest@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are people who had to alter their pre@@ - and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i and so be asked , as even Arabic names are not toler@@ ated , because the speaking of Arab language or wearing Arabic clothes .
given the given circumstances , which the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i have to end@@ ure , beat human rights activ@@ ist alert before the situation is explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world aw@@ ake and taking note of it .
the main reason for su@@ icide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ icide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I am not identifying with the femin@@ ism , nor with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a translated version of the opinion which was written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions appeared .
you can read in the comments under the original text .
when I say that I am not femin@@ ists , many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even lay well through scientific and social arguments in front of me , why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should generally be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , that women still earn less money in spite of the same formation as men .
that women are still under str@@ ingent monitoring when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women were tr@@ acked sooner or later in various areas of life at a gl@@ acial blan@@ ket , and that discrimination based on sex are still going through the many different countries and beliefs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced that I have been double and three @-@ fold under@@ ne@@ ath .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I come on skin color , on racism , on black CIS women , on black tran@@ si@@ dente women , on black women in the LGB@@ T community or on black women from the Dias@@ pora ; if I mention , on what kind we have been physically , se@@ el@@ astic and ver@@ bal mis@@ used , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , decide to keep many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but they all agree that women - all women - should come together to up@@ lift their voices and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya to sing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to sing the equality ( some ) of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they don &apos;t want to talk about it , in addition to sexu@@ alised violence an institu@@ tion@@ alised form of rac@@ ist violence , we are exposed to black women on two times .
or about that black women and women of other eth@@ nic@@ ities and home countries earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls will be referred to as a white girl as white girls , due to apparent integration problems .
or that women in black spher@@ es and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk , domestic violence and violence in the partnership suffer , as white women .
on the one hand , I know that all women , all men and all men have no skin color , on the other hand , I cannot join me as a black woman , in whose centre the white woman stands , who refuse to take in@@ justice in their mind , which relate to the gender as well as the skin colour of a person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women and repeatedly rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
So@@ jour@@ ner reported 18@@ 51 in her speech : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I also find myself to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a de@@ human@@ ized and margin@@ alized essence .
I am looking forward to re@@ plen@@ ish myself , who also absor@@ b through cultural appropri@@ ation of our customs and customs in order to drive its eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c program .
I will no longer try to suggest white women &apos;s importance of exagger@@ ation of skin colour and sex . for some of them will continue to im@@ pose the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to off@@ end them of a better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women different homes a home and limit themselves from the white femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name .
I prefer to get rid of me full and completely different from femin@@ ism instead of putting me into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of feeling for a white @-@ femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m that is so stub@@ born that inter@@ c@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it &apos;s more important than ever that we define black women from our own ideas and move into the spher@@ es which will be created by us . &quot; &quot; &quot;

although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists are immediately called separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion after they have read these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can up@@ lift black women and women of other cultures because in this para@@ dig@@ m I have existed .
I am recognized because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this para@@ dig@@ m .

p@@ add@@ ling against cont@@ amination : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this entry by Tod@@ d Reu@@ b@@ old was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reported in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the framework of a content sharing agreement , this article will be re @-@ published here .
over the past 7 years , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern due to the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . its mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentation by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of cont@@ amination in its church .
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a .
scientists from all over the country are concerned that the decades of war , the construction of storage and un@@ controlled development , lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization of Water@@ ke@@ e@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ ke@@ eper Alliance - that advoc@@ ates and working to protect the rivers , rivers and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a sums up the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water more , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq , and multi@@ medi@@ al journalist , produced , filmed and published .
the focus of her work lies on over@@ followed , little frigh@@ tening sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use co@@ oper@@ atively video graphics and new multi@@ medi@@ al techniques , with their help of oppressed communities to tell their stories in their way .
Paraguay Women and her more difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The we@@ eping women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents their pain over the women &apos;s ordination in the country and in the region to express their ref@@ us@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the short@@ ened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # soft @-@ smoking smoking ) reported on the violence of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed for the protection of the persons concerned .
a police comm@@ iss@@ ar said Ada B@@ á@@ ez , that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their ex@@ ecutives who have become violent @-@ violent .
since the end of her relationship has passed some time and the police said , her statement would be put to the files , but more could not do .
as another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena due to abuse , useful also the acute ad of Ada B@@ á@@ ez nothing .
a few days later , the second wife moved their message .
breaking the v@@ icious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women even fail to show them , they do not generally receive support from the state .
in many cases women also are financially dependent on the men who mis@@ use them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence , to be victims at all in the enforcement authorities .
inhal@@ t@@ 1 beats and Stati@@ stic@@ s@@ 2 Un@@ seen abuse and a judicial system , which is nothing special imm@@ on@@ 3 Paraguay laws : good approach , defic@@ i@@ ent implementation , b@@ lows and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women are really mis@@ used , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gen@@ der@@ ask at the Centro de Doc@@ ument@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various data and reports , which , however , do not even indicate to show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
however , the numbers available are alarm@@ ing .
in 2015 , at the District @-@ state department of 9@@ 600 ads continued because of domestic violence . at 70 % of it , it was about violence against women .
86 % of ads in the police came by women .
there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in peace @-@ dishes . also here came 86 % of the adver@@ ts of women .
in the ads said 40 % of women , that they were physically demanding , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse .
these statistics however do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually displayed . &quot; on any woman , which may be ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of mental abuse , 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on any woman , which may be ref@@ unded because of physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared it at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since eman@@ cip@@ her in Paraguay is not an own off@@ ence , the enforcement authorities cannot be adequately documented how many women become ass@@ ass@@ inated any year by their current or former partners .
until August 2016 , journalists were at least 12 cases of women &apos;s genocide in the country alone .
the Co@@ ordinator of Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women have been mur@@ dered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates die in Paraguay all ten days a woman due to violence caused by men .

invisible abuse and a judicial system that takes nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z has been the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called his name to him all of her former friends .
in the beginning they didn &apos;t want it , but then there was still . this should be her forever .
today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer work with Carlos . but two years she bore the mental violence against women , while the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recogni@@ zing the most severe recogni@@ z@@ able :
I have never thought that I would once again be victims of abuse .
when I read earlier about it , I always thought that only women happens to be subj@@ ecting because they f@@ ool themselves from violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse through Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had ins@@ ulated them .
many people responded to their posts , including Carlos themselves . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ isch if he ever had the hand against them , and refused to conf@@ ess that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why they had fallen by Carlos so long and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had a certain extent to blame .
Victoria San@@ tos that did not come from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with authorities in Paraguay , to prove that their former partner had mis@@ applied them .
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe &quot; ) which consists of women all in any way of abuse off@@ ences .
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences to listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victoria &apos;s case all started with mental abuse .
their prosper@@ ous partner eventually managed to convince them that they were worth@@ less .
then he started to beat her .
Victoria ads with the authorities did without the result and also from their relatives , they received no support .
it led to a trial against its former partners who developed into an in@@ consistent legal struggle between Paraguay and her native country , in which it was mainly about money , power and influence of their former partner .
Paraguay laws : good approach , defic@@ i@@ ent implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws , which are very good but are not used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the indication of abuse is a path full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , a bill was discussed , known under the has@@ ht@@ ag # Por@@ El@@ las ( # Für@@ th ) .
this has@@ ht@@ ag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ income ) are part of a campaign on Twitter , supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International .
the original design of the law looks ahead , Fem@@ ig@@ d to explain an independent pen@@ ft@@ ment @-@ continu@@ ance and tough@@ er to pun@@ ish as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the legislation was changed in some points , in order to also win members for the law , which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions are paved , which are currently banned in Paraguay , and pun@@ ished with up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill introduced , most of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) moving costs incur@@ red by the victims of violence by present themselves , if they just want to apply , and would like to receive a secure accommodation , to the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective if the law does not provide sufficient financial resources for this purpose :
in Paraguay , abuse is seen as a part inter@@ personal relations .
here a re@@ think has to take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something Nor@@ mal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who are silent in view of these facts is guilty and contributing to the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need to refund so long you until abuse is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate has been adopted , however , parts of the law has been modified ; however , there was a passage of passage that included the partners in cases of domestic violence for reconciliation .
the opinions about the changes will go apart .
the section regarding reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for ag@@ g@@ ressor to re @-@ attack his prey .
the fil@@ ing of words &quot; gender &quot; , &quot; political force , &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ as@@ sment &quot; from parts of the law applies as much back@@ stroke .

independent media in O@@ man to continue to ban on a newspaper after the pro@@ hibition of a newspaper
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked because of a decision of the exchange of information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the For@@ bidden Zeitung Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago the Ott@@ oman authorities have concluded an independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the Sult@@ ant .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues in prison , where he was imprison@@ ed in prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and put in trial , but later came free .
O@@ man is governed by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n S@@ aid , who came to power after he ib@@ n his father , S@@ aid ib@@ n T@@ aim@@ ur , by a State .
since then , he d@@ ressed , in addition to his role as the only Sult@@ an , the main offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defense Minister , Defence Minister , Foreign Minister , Foreign Minister , Foreign Minister , Minister of the Supreme Council for planning and President of the Central Bank .
the rule of sult@@ ans is characterized by the persist@@ ence efforts of the security forces , the public freedoms , including press freedom , limiting and human rights defen@@ ders , independent journalists , blo@@ gg@@ ers and other activists .
the authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematic and hin@@ dering citizens , also activists , to express their views on public affairs of the country like corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , her closing and det@@ ention three of their editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n has been an independent newspaper since its inc@@ eption in 2007 about corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces J@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n was published an article entitled &quot; high @-@ level parties to the hands of the judiciary . &quot; it was about corruption in the judiciary and the intervention of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report by government officials , judges of the Supreme Court in O@@ man were put under pressure to lift a verdi@@ ct in an inheritance dispute . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n from 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ level parties bind hands of the judiciary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Al @-@ Abr@@ i was approved by the ISS and was charged with the Special department by the ISS and on arrival by the security managers .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS awarded the dep@@ uty @-@ chief editor of You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j who claimed to be named after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper had been closed at un@@ certain time after the information was given the statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and spread of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial in Mas@@ kat was the first hearing in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i .
the Court condemned three journalists to prison terms and also ord@@ ained the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned to the dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet &quot; and &quot; excav@@ ation of the pre@@ valence of the State . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of the violation of an audience and sec@@ rec@@ y guilty .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year imprisonment and funds in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a one @-@ year working @-@ ban was imposed on the two journalists .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine . in the amount of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 million dollars ) after making use of &quot; an information network to spread material that could pose a danger to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i a deposit was set up in the amount of 5000 om@@ an Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the judgment .
the Appe@@ al Court said to Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after the postpon@@ ement of his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he was imprison@@ ed his sentence in prison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Appe@@ als also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information , the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the decision of the court to resume Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper sees itself still exposed to attacks by the om@@ anic government .
on January 8 , the information of information leaves a statement with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the information of information is personally conducted an additional statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and thus the Minister expressed another time against the decision of decision @-@ making , the publication of the newspaper .
the continuing closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where press freedom was wo@@ unded in recent times .
for example , the closing of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country , can susp@@ end their operation .
due to the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the det@@ ention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ an authorities still are not ready to end the extensive infrin@@ gement of the press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the administrative authorities to :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediate and un@@ condition@@ ally release ;
2 . ensure a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper so that their journalists can go on their work ;
3 . to protect freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances ensure that human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in O@@ man can ex@@ ert their right@@ ful human rights work , and without fear of exposure , including judicial supervision .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , the human rights defen@@ ders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ gg@@ ers , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf Region and in neighbouring countries through the promotion of opinion and organisation , and the right to meet peac@@ efully , supported and provide them protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it W@@ arri@@ er 2016 in Zambia , picture happens with his permission
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media . it is an increasing area that addresses the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need on site @-@ performing medical research . there are two reasons for a lack in the range of global health , many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far better effects in the poorest countries in Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for studying these diseases from the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem .
second , research , which is conducted by African scientists by establishing own research capacity in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can be con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it W@@ arri@@ er is director of central centr@@ or in the centre for research on Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , particularly when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Louis@@ iana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he sear@@ ched itself on HIV virus that he decided to go back home to support the s@@ amb@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices Dr. W@@ arri@@ er discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ concep@@ tions of the media about this research .
( Disclaimer : Dr. W@@ arri@@ er speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it W@@ arri@@ er RW : the main focus of my work on the application of research results . at the moment I support the s@@ amb@@ ic national program for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
moreover , I just strengthened a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogen@@ s .
G@@ V : what do you think are the most important current themes in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only set solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise we will always stay receiver instead of being M@@ acher .
the solutions that we get are often not appropriate in our environment , and sometimes it &apos;s impossible to use it here .
G@@ V : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists to projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are very well supported .
it &apos;s difficult to find people who want to come back or want to draw here because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research that you did not previously had ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs much money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratories is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
G@@ V : how is the public opinion of science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
G@@ V : how big is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa what should they focus on , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there are need for special scientific training , starting in every age .
the social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of the space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ agi@@ ous diseases ) and efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
G@@ V : can you describe us the advantages and cons of life as scientists in Africa from western countries , based on your experience ?
LW : often there are the limited speed , things to do , and the complicated access to scientific expertise which represent here challenges .
the system that peri@@ odic@@ ally make articles available only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of availability and the speed of research .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the USA to India : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to change global food production . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contribution by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on was bre@@ d in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ ge@@ ous , the first plant that is cultivated and consumed by NAS@@ A A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for nearly 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was achieved only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question how many sal@@ v@@ ents can get there .
but beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he re@@ marked that more and more Sal@@ ads have been pat@@ ented and that he could not use it further for the bre@@ eders .
the patents are not only available for individual types , but also for certain properties such as resi@@ li@@ ence to diseases , a special red or green leaf .
over the past few years more and more such patents have been registered on more plants such as cere@@ als or cart@@ on locations . due to this trend , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts are providing food security to the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia , mort@@ ar is still alive , but in the meantime he takes longer , since his work is still further complicated by more and more limitations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s as I would lie in a river a rock bit around which I must f@@ ump@@ add@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we must do that now , but it is a break with the tradition of tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents go to Sal@@ ads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand in court , no one can breed any new sal@@ ine , because all the characteristics are already pat@@ ented , &quot; he &apos;s doing so well as possible and tries to breed those characteristics he wants .
however , he is very careful and stri@@ ves to use no material that is protected as a intellectual property .
it has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the U.S. and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; ) .
A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the ISS and have Red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at the Sor@@ te Out@@ red@@ ge@@ ous in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station gr@@ ated and eaten there . there will be tested whether plants can be cultivated in the outer space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather than it would come out of the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding .
the open source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was brought to life to ensure that some plant types and -@@ gens are not protected as an intellectual property and are permanently usable for plant bre@@ eders permanently .
within the framework of the initiative , in short , Os@@ si , can also commit itself to US bre@@ eder that others can use it freely freely from them .
this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds , and they can sell them . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders only allow others who buy seeds , to breed , and not immediately pro@@ so@@ w out - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant patent or prescribed .
do@@ zens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
for the Emer@@ itus Professor of the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si @-@ executive member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are in control of the seeds and the possibility to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
seeds , according to him , plays a role in larger co@@ res like biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter or only little by bre@@ d seed with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open source &quot; movement is not busy with gene@@ tically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be pat@@ ented , whether vegetables , cor@@ n , gene@@ tically altered or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; to buy our goal of ecological sustainability , in addition to the most recent examples the inter@@ pret@@ ations of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer , which is offered in August and September 2016 . &quot; who is a good , locally and sustainable producing vegetables , should also know that the way it is breeding is breeding .
nutrition sou@@ ps without seed of seeds is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative strongly commit themselves to making other seeds at their disposal . in order to pursue its action in contrast , seeds and plant characteristics .

Os@@ si @-@ supporters argue that the future of food supplies is je@@ op@@ ar@@ dised because the available co@@ pool is due to the ever numerous intellectual property rights based on plant material , which is thus always available to be reduced , un@@ abl@@ eness .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive of the Os@@ si , has engaged himself in her doc@@ tor@@ ate with genetic variation with car@@ r@@ ots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all cart@@ ou@@ fl@@ es has been protected as a intellectual property , making it available for plant bre@@ eders either at all or only usable .
for other plants there are still no such estimates , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass @-@ in@@ cis@@ ion plants as wheat is pat@@ ented in a bigger scale as a salad or car@@ r@@ ots .
a question of point of view
plants are bre@@ d that they are targeted their desired features - of such , through which their taste or colour improved until such , due to which they hold in certain environments , and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eder through more and more patents always decre@@ ases . genetic diversity is currently unnecessary than ever since the altered conditions are worse by climate change are far worse predic@@ table .
in an e @-@ mail &quot; Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spre@@ cher@@ in Car@@ ly Sc@@ adu@@ to that genetic diversity is important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four Gen@@ banks and the cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company will implement the preservation of genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradi@@ cts that intellectual property re@@ im@@ bur@@ se other bre@@ eders , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant quality innovations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expi@@ res . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method for the same result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such protection does in@@ hibit innovation not , but encourages it to be provided by the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mort@@ on sees that differently : 20 years to wait until a patent is moving , certainly not innovations .
and if you are waiting for such a long time to breed plants , adapted to the changing environmental conditions , you could have lost the fight already .
the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general public and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither time nor the money for such form@@ alities and mon@@ ary incentives are not attractive to us .
we want to make farmers work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what motiv@@ ates us and it will be impossible if we can &apos;t continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
altogether , Mort@@ on is bot@@ her@@ ed by Mort@@ on to pat@@ rons in the concept , &quot; We created the characteristics not really itself .
the plants form they themselves and as bre@@ eders , we are ultimately no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , Plan@@ z@@ enz@@ ü@@ chter@@ in in the US @-@ State Oregon and Os@@ si @-@ executive member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who bre@@ d a s@@ orting and ch@@ d his own values into them .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures should be needed for cultivation as such as Her@@ bi@@ zi@@ de , who are bre@@ d in his sorts of agriculture .
my concept is precisely the case . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that are moving on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they create the majority of smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they refuse to patent or hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewar@@ ding or both is the case .
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on is looking for a breeding garden of Sal@@ ads .

Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eder through the A@@ void of pest@@ ici@@ ents of innovative things : &quot; it looks like I am using my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that pat@@ rons .
I still need new material for my catalog , since I know that my competitors are selling my varieties within a couple of years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years , so that in my opinion it is pretty simple . &quot;
while the USA seem to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept has grown rapidly throughout the world .
in India the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources , an &quot; open source &quot; seed program . to preserve the seed of traditional crops , the center of farmers work together and helps them to breed new varieties that fulfill certain requirements .
it also supports them to get to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
the German organization Agre@@ co@@ l operates at an &quot; Open Source &quot; License , which ultimately is a form@@ ell@@ ar and legally binding form of the Os@@ si @-@ obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union .
( rules for breeding differ from country to country , present , because of the Os@@ si obligation cannot simply be one of one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive Council of the European Union , the European Commission , declar@@ es that conventional plants should not be pat@@ ented , so it is against the current practice of the European patent , which patents on conventional plants in conventional plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a statement is not yet a law ; now it is by the governments of the Member States to bring the sponsor@@ ship to this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation H@@ iv@@ os hosted a conference to &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ seed systems in Ethiopia , launched by farmers , operators of seed banks and seed companies from all over East Africa to find out something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Program for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systems explains that the organization is currently a global alliance for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed systems built next year of the official start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a merger of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on Ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database on seeds and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - an Verb@@ und made from aid organizations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - published a report . it shows that farmers have the opportunity to live on seeds , to exchange and improve seed policies to ensure a stable supply of food .
the report also empha@@ sized the importance of a varied , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a link , by the Lu@@ by of Os@@ si hopes that soon more people will be recognized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has grown mainly on where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to make the people clear that there is more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still , the Egyptian authorities still un@@ lock content on the internet .
this time it hit the website of an human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend around the 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government has documented the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documented human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt as well as the Arab world .
August published the network an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ized for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ab@@ bt@@ - despite this attack and the perpet@@ u@@ ation of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities to release the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it was never as important as it is now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirm that all technical possibilities will be postpon@@ ed to overcome the block and not em@@ ulate . we insist on to fulfill our task further .
AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first ar@@ dised website of an human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities planned more than two months 21 websites , such as the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ speaking edition of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar origin@@ ating network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era because of the alle@@ ged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , there is also no access to the blog of the Colom@@ ni@@ sten and human rights researchers Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of colum@@ ni@@ sts and articles , which he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now the blog , which he initiated to get the c@@ ens@@ ur@@ ors of the Egyptian government , even the aim of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider at which also Zi@@ adas blog is native , on the other hand it is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , was spent nearly 500 days in cap@@ tivity , after having been arrested by Egyptian security workers in December 2013 , and recorded a video how the police exercise of physical violence against two students .
his articles mainly focus on politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed itself to the block in the block and reflected what this means for him :
the , blogs to block is very old , however , has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , so it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It was able to give me the feeling of a revol@@ t condition ; a dec@@ ency , a su@@ bre@@ eder murder , un@@ loading at the national Security Council , the barrier of blogs as well as any other web page for which I worked .
2 ) You have proved that I wrote not otherwise . in other words , my words have an impact , if only on a small audience .
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used to post the post of articles in order to avoid the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
but now , after they have blocked him and they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog yet .
the Mu@@ ehl continue the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ence and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from May 24 to August 06 . August 133 websites . this includes technical tests in the networks of different Internet Service Provider ( IS@@ P ) , amongst others Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also document the block@@ age of vendors , which was possible through the processing of intern@@ ships and private brow@@ sing , so called Virtual Private Net@@ works ( VP@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday , June 12 we noticed how the inter@@ ruption of web pages that offer VP@@ N@@ s .
such practice indicates the intention of the government to block content and fil@@ tering the Egyptian users may have access to the Egyptian users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is additionally wast@@ ed that the vill@@ agers must be made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis , using the fact that they can proceed before the Court against these actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to walk with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day after day newspapers in whole Brazil with d@@ ding head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of many postcard theme .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old at school , &quot; J@@ eden in the second day is killed a police be@@ am@@ ter in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Di@@ ebe smok@@ y pharmacy with military weapons from , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ he sends to 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Lu@@ ftw@@ ood in Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation the atro@@ cities of 2017 reached the highest state in Rio for 10 years .
the Brazilian government organisation Global Justice has even called for the United Nations to interven@@ e .
reports like these have become all@@ daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; find at least the managers of a local paper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the article published for the detailed reporting of violence in the Rio known newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which they announced a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now being published there .
the motives for their decision declared the paper as follows :
extra will continue to report on crimes that will happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex marriage , etc . all , but what happened by the civili@@ zed standard and what only in Rio is going to be published in the heading &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative , so that we as journalists do not close our eyes before cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the chief editor of the newspaper , that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra is probably the only newspaper across the world with a war of war in a country that does not recognize the war at all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that there are indications of the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro .
the newspaper continues to write the paper :
we recognise that a war dis@@ crete when it is dist@@ orted to also be used , atro@@ cities of the police , who first sho@@ ots and then asks questions to cover .
but we defend the war based upon information and the fight against corruption in police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; mean more than they have been useful ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasil argu@@ ed the journalist in Cec@@ í@@ lia , to design@@ ate the violence as &quot; war . &quot; this is in their opinion a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy through the media , and could make it difficult to account the police force .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as in the analysis of military operation in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in staff , education and a historic and self @-@ suff@@ iciency condemned by public service .
to the memory : the federal state Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just his capital .

Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the non @-@ violent place in Brazil &quot; is false , &quot; 22 of 30 violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date data .
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .

at the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases . for several years the U@@ PP , however , following several reports on chic@@ ane and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor commun@@ es , which should protect the newly established police unit , increasingly under attack .
on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux ch@@ art@@ ed from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio are not equal - by the Geneva Convention and identi@@ fies the name of civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the setting of the situation in Rio as War are also serious consequences for the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this calls on the state to use the means and ways that are typical of a war . this includes the penetration into the territory of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enemy of &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where a civil war is an in@@ geni@@ ous point in the countryside and become an object for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ ater@@ al damages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; irrit@@ ated balls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal attacks and block@@ ages , mainly by the Assad regime against lo@@ y@@ ale troops .
according to victory Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace organisation PA@@ X and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege .
the region of East Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack on chemical weapons killed August 21 , 2013 , called the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume , based on investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the mass@@ acre of Assad regime has been exercis@@ ed by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , those of rebels have been controlled outside of Damascus under si@@ ege , which resulted in local citizens &apos; residents or are instruc@@ ted by tunn@@ els and check@@ points .
by the years of block@@ ade , traditional food such as meat have become un@@ att@@ ain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a return , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can en@@ plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and guide the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the conventional , in Syria being planted foods and are only extremely rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . their food is however an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the besi@@ eged East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Dire@@ kt of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news Agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultiv@@ ate pil@@ es because they have high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for this project for three years and op@@ pressing his relief that it now gains more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reputation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to raise money for the initiative , take advantage in consultation with the NGO gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to give 125 families knowledge to the plant@@ ing of mushrooms , so Dr. Lei@@ la for Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12.@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative is dependent on generators , which keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel tight , locally produced fuel are used in plastic materials to provide the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. Lei@@ la told Global Vo@@ ices that they started with &quot; production from the regions , before they test their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mush@@ room in a tub . when they managed , they used a greater tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have created a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apprentic@@ eship &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after further 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms anywhere in the east Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la declared that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the Pil@@ z@@ breeding from various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; break of si@@ ege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suff@@ iciency , by eating ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) to recovery new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women , the home work .
create new jobs for people with disabilities who are tied to their home .
he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and si@@ ege is visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get inspired our experiences in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for victims of the fires of 2017
several hundreds of people protest@@ ed in many district towns in Portugal and called for justice for victims of the fires that occurred at the North of Portugal in the North of Portugal .
twenty @-@ two people died and around 70 were wo@@ unded as a result of the forest fires of the 15th and 16th of October . this led to the fact that the Government proclaimed the last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days of a state of State .
bre@@ aches were also registered in the region of G@@ ali@@ zi@@ en in Spain , where there were 4 dead .
it is estimated that there have been more than 500 fire@@ bur@@ sts that spreads in the northern and centrally located regions of the country and about 250 million acres of forest and numerous villages .
in June in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and over 200 years .
according to European forest surveillance systems that monitors the forest surfaces by satellite , are around 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest in 2017 - an area of the size of the district Lisbon .
so that you can make a better picture of the Ernst of the situation : there &apos;s no fire in 4 districts .

the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy
the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better prev@@ ent@@ ative and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked themselves why civil protection was not able to l@@ ame the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
João So@@ ver@@ al from the Federal Republic of Portugal , declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o ,
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for anything and nothing .
this Sunday they did it anywhere , there are d@@ art@@ ed reports of open streets that were enclosed by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen in June as the streets were very late . &quot;
furthermore , building permits are depos@@ ited in furn@@ aces with high bran@@ ding .
a far @-@ reaching proposal to the Wal@@ dre@@ form , which had brought the government to serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was addressing the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a Lock@@ ass@@ ing of the law , if the applic@@ ant had a means to self @-@ protection , it was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says João Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in one night in autumn 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years ago , a terrible civil war broke out between the different Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings which had conqu@@ ered the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan has become a land of terror and despair .
exactly at this time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of the Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Centr@@ af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , for the last time with his family at dinner .
even though his mother was not so said at that time , she knew that she would no longer see her son for a long time - maybe even more .
in the morning , the boy should stopped .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ ron &apos;s party of Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ dat had just been mur@@ dered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara were suddenly scre@@ ed .
the Taliban located for its hat@@ red on the Ha@@ ara of the Taliban is getting closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the land toward Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af took her back in Pakistan .
he worked for a few years in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his little reward , and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country with other refugees and s@@ lug@@ s with mort@@ ar who were he@@ avier than he himself , in order to earn his livel@@ i@@ hoods .
back then as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran were characterized by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; rec@@ essed A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the site , on which we worked .
there was no services there and no heating . we suspended t@@ oss in front of the open windows so that we do not refres@@ h at night . &quot;
after four years A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and went up for the trip to Europe .
in the dangerous over@@ ride on the sea he suffered a boat race and stran@@ gled on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities had rejected his asylum war , A@@ mi@@ af 2002 came to Italy .
some time was rob@@ ber@@ nation &apos;s homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day meal to the need@@ y .
it is true that Italy is a very second chance for being an asylum seek@@ ers . it is true also that the conditions , the asylum seek@@ ers in the country are found , cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
the human rights organisation of Civil Liber@@ ties for Europe writes , the system &quot; suff@@ ers under a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be housed in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special performance centers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law asylum seek@@ ers , asylum seek@@ ers may only be assigned to an open centre , if they officially asked a request for asylum , which can be drawn after the registration of asylum sear@@ ched for month .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation to rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so there is also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his unbeliev@@ ably li@@ fest@@ yles helped ash @-@ sheep to release yourself from these conditions soon .
after having made various works in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ f hidden his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this went so well that after a while , he opened a second hostel and a car@@ amel .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is &apos;s success story now is the topic of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Vene@@ tian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director A@@ min W@@ ah@@ id@@ i .
the movie was awarded the Venice City Award , which has been awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles .
according to the official estimates about 20,000 people live in Italy .
for many of them the country is a trans@@ itional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years some of Afgh@@ ans come across the company , including tail@@ oring , travel agents , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea to his restaurant Orient Experience , in which the wa@@ iters and the chef is mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the restaurant &apos;s menu reflects by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts the history of their trip to Italy .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Cab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sushi Restaurant in Rome also represent Afgh@@ ans .
A@@ shar@@ k &apos;s goals also reach far beyond the Italian food industry and the retail and aim of the country , which he had to leave behind than teenagers .
&quot; where a risk is , are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I never forget my country and I can &apos;t live happ@@ ily when I know that my people suffer .
I am planning a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent the half of society and have to get the same possibilities as any other . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af also nar@@ rows plans for opening a factory in Kab@@ ul where the people will learn the packaging and preser@@ v@@ ative techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their harvest@@ ers on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end are stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af made this journey itself . well , now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
Ne@@ ti@@ zen Report : legislative dis@@ cards from Egypt allow down@@ turn social networking Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for over 900 days in cust@@ ody .

global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ ti@@ zen Report is an international snap@@ shot , the challenges , vic@@ tories and upcoming trends in global Internet rights
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian parliament is scrut@@ in@@ ised a bill that considers that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after registration at a government agency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
users need to be able to use social networks within six months after un@@ successful legislation on the website of the authority under the name of its complete name as well as their exp@@ ul@@ sion number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who failed to take this step could be sentenced to up to six months sentence or en@@ tri@@ c@@ ation of a criminal payment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law , which was advert@@ ised by six@@ ty members , is currently the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament in front of and should be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may a further member of the Parliament adopted a legislative proposal to be introduced to the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the president or a senior officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the Egyptian Law , the prosec@@ ution of the President as well as state facilities were already stra@@ ined . under the legislative proposal , such an act would be sei@@ zed with pris@@ ons and money charges , as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
should the law be adopted , it may mean up to three years imprisonment for the sentenced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , this would under@@ pin political climate , in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of expression has already been in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who took photograph@@ ed by the Egyptian police officers while putting force against demonstr@@ ators who had taken against the military put@@ sch who had led to the President Moh@@ ammed Mor@@ si elected by the President Moh@@ ammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan wa@@ ited , as more than 700 protest@@ ers , who had been arrested by the same incident , four years in jail for a tri@@ bun@@ al .
recently he was postpon@@ ed his trial on 20 May because the prison management according to human rights groups failed to bring the accused of prison in the court room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty on the basis of one , so many human rights groups agree , hy@@ po@@ ids of inter alia , weapon @-@ owned , illegal assembly , murder and su@@ preme murder .
in another case , a criminal court in Giza was free for the two journalists h@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting to pro @-@ Mor@@ si seating block at the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya place in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Ab@@ dul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly who were also arrested in the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tun@@ e@@ tical activ@@ ist to we@@ ed documents
in May Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which co @-@ founder of independent Medien@@ playsite Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was primarily questioned by the President of the Republic , according to the plan , the busin@@ ess@@ men and during the former regime was supported by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali the corruption filed , Am@@ nest@@ y , provided that all un@@ law@@ ful funds with@@ drawn .
that published on April 21 on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at &apos;s website , casts a light on how the presidential plans to support the law@@ suit .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia le@@ aning the nam@@ ing of his sources under the indication of article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press report , which journalists have the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless he joined the District Court in Tunis on May 9th as a witness .
will China force the users of social media to act as a reference point ?
according to new provisions of the Information Author@@ ities of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users need social media outlets in China before they write or share messages in social media .
in the regulations it is also stated that the registration is required with the full re@@ plac@@ eable name .
analy@@ st assume that an anonymous comments in social networks are supposed to be achieved within social networks . it is still un@@ clear how the authorities apply these regulations .
Chinese networks have proposed in the social media , these regulations sel@@ ects only sel@@ ectively in order to protect the citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
see you then in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may the state c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Russia have access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or failed We@@ eks to register at the state government as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organizer of the information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this design@@ ation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government arran@@ ges a list of online services , which provides the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; the law allows the government to be responsible for removal of content and force them on request for the suspension of user data .
these websites are currently owned websites like V@@ kontak@@ te and od@@ no@@ class@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mailbox and d@@ utz@@ ing other services .
Turkish Court consists of blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court had the block Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administ@@ rators refused to clear two English @-@ speaking articles , the statements , Turkey under@@ cut the ji@@ ha@@ dists in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication has been blocked because it is too &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an information source that works with groups to don@@ ate a political black@@ mailing campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time Turkey has blocked the website completely . it is thus , besides , China , one of the few countries around the world in which access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain can not stop to turn around .
following this week , the Government of Britain is based in a targeted consultation with regard to increased monitoring tools , the Internet services provider , to monitor communications in real time and install back@@ door programs to de@@ cryp@@ t the data encryption .
the government has been consul@@ ted by telecommunications companies and secret services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population .
this consultation will be valid until 19 May . responses and proposals by members of the public can be forwar@@ ded to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
