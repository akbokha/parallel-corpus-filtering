<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love of America is extremely great.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my generation I grew up with American films, American music was danced, American authors read and operated his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact this country had a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American movie journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, who was covered with the help of Julia's Roberts as Jura-Studentin, who had the most important federal court with judges which had received its interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free to Method Man, "I was it, as if that is the absolute truth, certainly everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, had only reinforced my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "I always said," "" "America is the only country where I ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting you can always be that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very well-hearted love of his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most remarkable aspect of his ascension is for me, how he gets around with his bottiness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never keeps in his mind behind the mountain as it says so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague it expresses, and declares publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latino, Afrowest and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless people have responded to his statements and voted to him for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won with the Republican elections, was the highest number that had ever achieved by the nominee candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigzy person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not get Trump and his voters no line with people that I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme, the people from all over the world took, a deeply unbelieving person with whom I was talking about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also tuned Trumps's view was not in line with the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer" from the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix One" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Mumps is also in contrast to the generosity that I lived in Sandy Bahr, who fought their lives long, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She adapts to the commitment of Kristi Kappl, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace, and helped me to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot with my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those through them embodied my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While trump his path to nominate Republican candidate, sent me a grip and the counterpart of his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, more than 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps precisely because of its contempt to non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The debate with the idea that people voted for trump because they had either shared its racism and fanaticism, or because they were prepared to overlook these things, I broke almost the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the trump voters as a racist.</seg>
<seg id="34">To assign the people, one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates a incapability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their concerns and fears are not taken into account of the hectic changes in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that this voters no longer voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that does not disappoint it?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might want to say that in this America they are still important?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who have commented the cruel decision to raise a man who looks different with respect to those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(anm.): so much like" "" "drawing up the whites against all other ethnicities" "" "as much as" "" "titled" "" "on the White and whiplash, which means as it was the great Van Jones, just killed what America has done so magnificent." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the globe appreciate American ideal - no matter whether the myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever faith or background one may always have, America is everyone welcomed.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose his president, twice the son of Kenianers, whose story, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "however, with the election Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of the white Americas in this promise, saying," "" "to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism." ""</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11, the white man is again in the ruin, say they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all of this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who died in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton had a wordchange with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"" "" "" "Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" "" "Mr. Khan." ""</seg>

<seg id="56">"" "" "" "if someone who is not like you, a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a vote and a strong "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan closed in words: "God be praised that Mr. Trump is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country, for which his son was fallen, he sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan, could not find no place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And this is crashing my heart.</seg>

<seg id="70">That music, which is played in both places, not only the lives of children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music, which lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a great garbage dump, only 16 kilometres south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city, which is very popular among tourists but far from the nearby magnificent ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now the La Banda de música (musicde) has now been playing in the community: one of the children and adults existing Symphonie-Orchestra, which has found a way to overcome poverty with their music instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music-school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexikos, is known for its drugs misuse and banking violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But, after a random encounter with a French pilot, who started a musical project and the youth had such a rare hopelessness.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music-group very seriously, means the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty roads to follow their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing with shiny eye and playing in the excitement you will learn day for Day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Müllgarbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically up on the biggest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay capital - on instruments produced from reverwertely waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with re-prepared instruments that consist of local solid waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for music instruments in Cateura where the recycler led by Favio Chávez in order to transform parts of waste in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, violas, Celli, double-bass, guitars, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, which were all made out of the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire consists of classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article from Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local economist and musician instructor the children of Cateura, at the first time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach in the same place where the parents worked in the garbage, The children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents, because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as a travio, something that he never had seen before: one made from waste hered in violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is an entire orchestra that plays on instruments produced and which called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) draws the musical performance at:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates around one billion tonnes of waste each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here it turned him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational spectacle of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="100">In West Africa, at the time that this ship was already operated in liberal waters of illegal fishing, before it was the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were so accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a hurtwister of this species to their shores.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the comers, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised himself quickly against the ship. they refuse to baptize one of its harbours and also refuse to give him a fisherman permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that would simply refuse to refuse anything," "" "remembers Benedict Kiilu, a leader of the Kenyan Fisheries Agency. he is part of a team that discovered and followed the ship itself." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region; it was not succeeded to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to liberia due to pillage of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, the criminal practices uncrossed and resources, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO stop illegally stopped (Illegale fisheries).</seg>

""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, present because it is extremely difficult to pick up there. thus, the illegal fishing is a leading cause of the overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By intentional abcontempt of existing laws, through which certain habitats and types are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm that delikates balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also curated by the snail, so doing events today in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">Here, the individual countries can interact with each other for lists of existing licenses, news about suspected activities or details that you noticed or experienced during a harbor spection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea, using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to mark ships who fish in forblowing areas - some such that point out that a ship loads its domesticated fish on the road on other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such surveys may show whether the ships have a fish licence, where they were on the road and possibly also, whether they have a crime.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing, may refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports. what means that ships could not sell their cargo in their ports. and that they could even be forced to the numbers of penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then about significant financial losses for the owner, which means that the illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile." ""</seg>

<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is always further developed, will also help to hide the illegal ships who would like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and position." "" "says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NRO, which also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>

<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth is working together with Google and the marine environment Oceana, a platform for Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite data and can be viewed by means of which the position of each individual traceable ship can be displayed worldwide.</seg>

<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only feel crime, but they can also scare.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that confiscated earlier without a license and hardly to reckon with consequences, now know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu some of the countries participating in the FISH-i countries have now a 33% increase in fisheries set, since fishing boats can buy more licenses.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are multifaceted.</seg>
<seg id="377">For transfer, one needs two important skills: passive language skills to understand the initial text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is in case of native language. in general, the conviction that translators are in the target language - not in the language language - motherlanguage should be.</seg>
<seg id="379">Thus a French native language should translate into French example from the English language - not from French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ people who could use English as a mother tongue, translation into English. this may be attributable to error, reasons, or the relatively small number of English native speakers, the Japanese learning.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that do not have any foreign employees, they release translations of company-internal. then the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge will be considered best to translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The prescribed and puzzling phrases created by machine translation, show that this technique is not able to replace human translators for a long time. this applies to several languages particularly.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the rarest English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints, often used T-shirts or bags, are used only for stilistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>

<seg id="388">Translators are still acceptable or at least harmless. but of big companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto also makes use of a serious source for its translation.</seg>

<seg id="460">Alvarenga house worked in the house of her employer between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time so that you still stayed a lot of time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up every morning at 5 o'clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">Friday for example, purification them the refrigerator, cleaner the living room, polished the furniture and deposited the ground.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was ended, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more she was done with learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says, she had to be hungry, but also did not get unlimited food. "I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord than eating out of the refrigerator," they remember.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizers of the Partido liberal, a liberal party, which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">In some evenings of the householder Alvarenga, to stand beside him and read editorial articles from oppositionists such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to persuade them to give no faith in the reports of official media about the regime of dictator.</seg>
<seg id="471">And he held it for intelligent, but he did not interfere with her. "the landlord had found someone who spake, while he spoke of politics," she says.</seg>
<seg id="472">"they told me not often to visit my family because they had the opinion that I would be able to learn there" bad habit. "so they said that Alvarenga, that belongs to the indigenous group of Guaraní, at home again her mothertongue Guaraní would speak.</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they had the education they had made it to lose again, she declares.</seg>
<seg id="474">But she was totally clear that she was for everything she got of them, who had paid them with their hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also in school, Alvarenga has been discriminated against. "one thing that is almost never spoken, harassment and the chicane where Criaditas are exposed, when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parent, is criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I could invite anyone to go home. I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in time, where friendships arise, I particularly noticeable that I belonged to no group.</seg>
<seg id="479">The isolation was the worst of everything, "explains Alvarenga.</seg>

<seg id="526">A subtype of the larger family of leopards that matures through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are due to Wilderei, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat, and since they find less prey.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">Like Raza in the video shows, "the Persian leopard the only remaining robbery in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and the thought of ecosystem also depends on that a big robber is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopards in the free hunting is small and goes against zero. when the team in the video is thus determined that they have a shot of a great cat in the camera, Raza breaks into pure joy.</seg>

<seg id="544">In the beginning of March 2017, the progress made in the northeastern United Kingdom of Kahoku Shimpo, the progress made in the last six years to reconstruct the life of the three-fold disaster "of March 2011. a violent earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had triggered the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the Miyagi prefecture Miyagi. the Prefecture Miyagi was an unusual prefabrication in Japan, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring villages of Fukushima and Iwate have been forced forced, because the tsunami had let entire coastal towns disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, the Fukushima still lived a nuclear accident, already alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows which progress has been achieved for six years to rebuild the life of local resident.</seg>
<seg id="549">The full report of the newspaper involves both statistics of the Japanese authorities and survey results of those affected.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reported that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement mansions (coarab, in, saigai kouei juutaku) in the Prefecture Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate were completed.</seg>
<seg id="552">The biggest success among the three prefectures could record Miyagi, here, 80 percent of the planned replacement desk were finished.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate is completed 75 per cent of such houses, whereas Fukushima is up with 70 percent the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">At the same time, people still strive for six years after the catastrophe, evacuated from Behelow (in the south-minute, kasetsu juutaku) in final spare-houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the three-fold disaster almost 80 000 people were forced to live in containers.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such claims.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the Fukushima still live in emergency accommodation, whereas Miyagi is still successful in emergency shelters. more than 75 per cent of the evacuated complexes, which moved to the disaster in containers, were converted into final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number is here at 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools, who were affected by the unhappiness, their pforting until December 2016, which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, industrial reconstruction is far more difficult in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="562">During nearly 100 per cent of the fisheries harbors in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation in Fukushima only 30 percent of the fisheries harbors have reaped their operation.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and atomic accident, have moved into rodent in the three prefecture of agriculturally.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi managed to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent of the agricultural land in Fukushima can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic fact, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed Ackerel of Fukushima, are located in the nuclear wave zone. "</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has regained again to recover, but again Fukushima remains far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate can be up to 90 percent at the same stand as before the unhappiness. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only be found 75 per cent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reported that since the catastrophe, nearly half of the coast-inhabitants, it is harder to find their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to be able to establish a total image, the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the native population and among the evacuated results. she asked them about the state of rebuilding and also how their sensation has changed against the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring more about tsunami consciousness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local resident, measures have taken to be prepared to be prepared to the future earthquake and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 per cent of the surveyed that still hasn't been done enough in terms of disasters.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it is to those who had to be evacuated from the prefecture of Fukushima</seg>
<seg id="576">In their output to the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has strengthened its attention on the situation of evacuated from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima still had to experience the enormous earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima was also witness of the worst, disasters caused, atomic facts, the Japan ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">From 160 000 Evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were moved into areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, have been converted into long-lasting spare-houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the booth of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima off their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the catastrophism, most of the evacuated shelters are older than 50 years old. you have to compete in correct Behausages, because the efforts for reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima are competing with massive construction projects. this is a building projects, the part of the Olympic Games are to be held in Tokyo.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people encounter people from other countries, speaking a different language, the differences seem to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, it is often seen that a more reconnect than it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, extend our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look at precisely these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast we treat themes that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five global Voices members who remember one moment in which they have felt highly connected with someone over voice and country limits.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherman talks about how the love for music worked from the Iranian culture; Adriana Macias speaks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences that he collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were put into the sugar beet factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the decline, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory moved, and after its installations, until only the frame of steel and concrete remained remaining.</seg>

<seg id="637">The sugar industry had already resisted on the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, the inefficiencies, the poor management decisions and climate change.</seg>

<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugarbeech industry switched?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway station of the church saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar consumption industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar beers were outdated, and hardly competitive were they unsustainable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives, which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the added price increased about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025 the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 Report "agricultural spectives" of the OECD and FAO, the agricultural and nutritional organisation of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3,6 million tonnes), the raw sugar exports would be around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>

<seg id="654">In the following years the lactation of a total of 98 sugar factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar lohrfabrik Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on 14 May 2004.</seg>

<seg id="690">Admission of a song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations Communities in all of Canada are dealing with issues that are important for them. they do this by Hip Hop, thanks to a series of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour since 2014, workshop managers have worked directly to schools and youth centers in order to teach youth groups of songwriting, recording, audio- and video-production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were initiated by the Pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in Nord-Quebec with ten clree-communities and then with the Cree Hip Hop group The Northstar collaborated together.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop thus increases the young participants in talks on such as "cultural identity, language, debate, love, self acceptance or whatever comes into mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations Communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo in the area of the tribe of the kisskalum First State in British Columbia tells, for example, the history of the highway 16, also called "highway of tears," an street section in Westkanada, where almost two dozen people were left indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video games to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs, despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although youth have not always dominate the languages of the First Nations languages.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation have recorded, the chorus is sung to Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from Northstar Hip Hop group, who gave them a Strophe in dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebookpage of N'we Jinan stands at the Strophe in turn, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on the earth my days</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you turn our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as youth have lost our way to life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and face our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">This is how they can do what they are determined by the Creator</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary box, the reader and supporters of the Cree-language Kevin Brousseau also gives a contribution and adds the Strophe published in Silenclosure (which is also published on his blog and published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that violence should never be viewed as normal, regardless of what form they occur:</seg>

<seg id="780">I'm passing by date every day and see the titles pages with images, which actually only come from a textbook for criminology or from Akten of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the only one that is disgusted or sad. it acts as lack of respect towards the person who belonged to this body once.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider it normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">You write on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10 year old cousin thinks that he is foco (German: drug dealers) will be if he is great. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heldentures" of the offences if they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is, when they were to the ones who have lost someone and those who fear that they have happened that way.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories about mere numbers are in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the Tatenlessness of people is incredibly for me if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town will therefore be justified that they were" "" "emigrated" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of war shared."</seg>

<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexikos?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age whose parents care about them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a commodity and he tells you had to teach himself how to drink a egg, potatoes, tortillas, tortillas, and "Chichi" for the babies which live with him. this is his name for preparing the flyers with water, sugar and milk pulses.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine fools on his left leg - one for every lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and the learning had to live in order to live.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old he told him that his mother was vanished.</seg>
<seg id="807">But that was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood has been past two years ago when he was just a couple of blocks from his home, the bloody lyre of his father saw that by armed men out of a passing car was shot.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez saw the situation:</seg>

<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murder for public security and the Government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">Alone, the prosecutor's Bar was 3103 Morde. this corresponds to the average 8.5 Morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of words that have organized organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories still live in the face of new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we must not forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" founded the data journalism project Narcodata in 2015, its aim is to present the complex information behind the failed struggle against drugs, which has paved the country in the last four decades, in intelligible manner.</seg>

<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (frames) which draw this post. the first frame focused on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used regarding major discussions on the silence in relation to the assassination of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the assassination of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how a african live in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion should be understood and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worth examine how pictures are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">But a profound question is what happens when reading these images no longer can believe.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media there are tens of people who have accidentally share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggested this mood of misconception and mismisinformation that actual atrocities are untrue and narrods the real smewing of what actually happened in the DR Congo, in Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The dissemination of discounted images has already been revised in detail (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that the withhold of pictures of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are even demanded by the victims.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern that violent images readers and viewers desensitise them and give them the ability to empathy empathy (such as this study, who sought, how violent media work on it, others to help).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss with foramer's representations in the news media, the fact that it is indispensable for today's message reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experiment experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News". you will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture is suggested by the context or by completely misused species.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be an opportunity to connect here and now in spite of a language barrier to anyone?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the count of stories in their original language is a possible answer to that.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported a short report about another initiative by Steven Bird, the Untranslated blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of big cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already carried out events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages do not be given to the children's born children.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project applies:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that accept Diversity - safe spaces where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to join in.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listen often associated with it," "" "bring these events instead" "" "listening to appreciate," "" "to feel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storyteller would first introduce their story in their own language and translate them into English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storytellers, their devotion will lead and their representation to that the audiences can be initiated.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call forth laughing and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">For example, the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso that is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storytellers of Rassidatou are also the opportunity to explain to their country typical customs of narrative.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the fork of the rabbit and the pump in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After he explains the meaning of his fur, John Nyamusara is asked, "How is it speaking to an audience that does not understand your language?" with a wide ditches he shares his sense of the inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">You were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were very happy with me!</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which took up to 72 million US dollars, participated in the last 3 April 2017 various religious and civil organizations in a mass demonstration; the march started in the historian Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">She was called by the grouping "Frente ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (Civil War for the ural examination of the debts) and of the Eastern Assembly of Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The intercessors of the re-placement of the debt have also made a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Ricos is that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debts are accountable for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We call for a financial test and a conference committee without personal interests in public debts, with a firm, our working conditions, which acts in favour of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We will be blackmailed and suppressed.</seg>

<seg id="1187">The book that has been published last year and here license-free is available, contains a number of papers, which deal with the free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is:</seg>
<seg id="1190">"" "" "" "this book aims to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what the real costs are, with which this is linked." ""</seg>

<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture, has many of us start to reflect on their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we today here?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What have we decided?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of time-filled extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The webdeveloper for open source and digital activists is since March 2012 in the custody of Syrian government agencies.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015 Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment to be transferred to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, writer and lawyer, Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police in Bassel had taken on the basis of a" strictly secret "command of the military training from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported it was contacted by individuals on 12 November 2015, who themselves presented themselves as insider Assad's government and took note of a so-called death section against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">Its location and state remain still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in integrating access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, Technologist and at the moment of the leader of New Palmyra, a project, the Bassel founded, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Maybe none of Bassels cultural prototypes foresee than the work he began with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra Virtually.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the pathian of numerous civilizations and here merging Greek-Roman architecture with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel had not yet know that ten years after having started with this work, the IS would put everything to it, this architecture that does not only embodied the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This tense into the digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule created to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of invaluable value.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not yet finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of their man to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my entire life, dream of freedom to dream and bassel taught me to embrace it.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English when he was already in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read English well, write and talk.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always has shared his knowledge with each he has asked. he has taught other inctions, English to read, write and speak.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened to me the door to technology. he taught me to use both computer and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet at.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He has also associated other improper how they use computers, at least theoretically, without that they actually held one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of orphiting (Waiting), a Prosabuch which she wrote in the years 2012 till 2015 her husband was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together on the book for a long time.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mosambiance reacted by anger to a corrupt regime, where a governor after half his sentence has returned to the workplace at the state apparatus at which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">In this case, Diodino Cambaza is arrested in 2008 and 2010 with four other defendants were sentenced to 22 years imprisonment together with four other defendants (about 800 000 Euro).</seg>

<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately urged its reinstatement to the firm, which was then also happened on April 19th.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with an opinion of the general secretary of the Republic, which claims the request, there would be no obstacles to Cambaza to re-return to his old post since the company was no disciplining procedure after his term.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many citizens are not working well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The centre for public integrity (Centro de Integridade pública, briefly CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned into an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to repress the director.</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a return in the fight against corruption and clarified the lack of transparency and even a return in terms of the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">"" "" "" "what we take note is that the company should have a disciplinarian treatment against the inmitigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company shwiec apparently and prompted no reasonable legal steps to apply the appropriate functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the mosambique social media, reject this behaviour also, and considers the case be contradictory." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent type, he would be adviser after he was sentenced to a sentence and that half has sat down.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and develop his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has unauthorized to reintegrate into the company that he helped to cause damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore, it is obvious: Cambaza will gladly pay for its silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambiance and student of political science in Brazil, the director does not mention any morality:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza from the state is rewarded, because he dismissed him, I can't believe that one is rewarded someone in such a way that the state has already been so massive.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing to return to morals and to serve the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead he serves only the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as administered to an inexhaustible money source and the state itself this man became tired, which was charged and finally sentenced to a long detention.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook-users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took her post out of the net, because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although about the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people ostindian origin or in general use as an adjective. "</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or a part of a initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical "nationalist movements has given the word an extremely abidable connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra-nationalists than hate speech against Muslims who constitute a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight out hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar's can usually be associated with racism related to racism, but the word itself is not automatically stepped out of hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that too, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed by his use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Furthermore, there are several burmesical words with basic meanings which have the same letter like 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written on Burmesisch also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words such as' Kalar PAE '(Spage),' Kalar oat '(Kamel) or'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookie User Aung Kaat declared the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of a friend of mine was deleted today, because he contained the word of Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a great way whether they knew he could linders his back pain by making a word play.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The proposition ku la - "healing" (ku) + the Frageword (la) on Burmesan - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There have been various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win is the opinion that she will reduce hate speech radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook analytical should be analytical, before it all postulates, which wardly spread in the suspicion of racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manual.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtering the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automation will not understand what you are looking at Facetook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words left.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar PAE" (splitting).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these three-term nationalists spread the hate speech, received a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumvent their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all, the hate speech allows the efficiency of this strategy not long to hold.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and Wealth have proven that the censorship of impact often becomes a catch- and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply going to start to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described as Facebook started to clear his posts as he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' from social network is banished:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was aware of this new directive on Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the Word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited to post the Liken, post and parts of content for 24 hours because of the Post Office of the Facebook community standards. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of postings from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the Hassan nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail has been removed, who has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Mail without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post he shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the beginning of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Those words to shave will only be more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">It seems as if it started it without local context or technical assistance and have banned as words such as "chair" or "hersencurry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found that they have made mistake, they tried not to correct the falsified postal mail.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits they would have a big turnover, it would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has taken care of a lot of donor among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make themselves funny and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of Hassan, to see if their postcard from the net will be taken.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots from Facebook-Posts that have no hate speech, but still far removed:</seg>

<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists, who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should be affectionate in the communities in Myanmar in addition, especially in the area of Rakhine where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands of escape.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for his understanding, criticized hate speech at its Burmese pages under control.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply selecting the word 'Kalar', it could have been better on the context rather than on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1394">Day after day is evident how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV-series leak up against the lockout.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technologically sealing Internet users are used to use changing tools (an up-to-date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third VPN prevalence of the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been unched since 2008 articles from Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society held at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet since 2007, after the internet law (no. 5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">To China, Turkey is the most famous country in the world when it comes to massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to be blocked, there are now several mirrors (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">One solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform created all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralised Peer-to-Peer-network (i.e. calculator links) which does not base itself on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is not available in spite of legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogpost, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">Since we have heard the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we put everything to set Snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, the possibility to read the content on decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS was also assumed that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia-Foundation, and it is merely taking screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the web page.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to handle the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consunny from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mirrors page from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to rise similar mirrors if contained in the particular country of Wikipedia.</seg>

<seg id="1410">One responds to another URL, which is not the original one. that what you see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server guides the request to the correct Wikipedia-page so it's possible to see the contents of Wikipedia, then if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are there.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two will continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women are wearing at any time Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the flashing for more freedom of movement or clothes - at the end of a hard to navigate the river.</seg>

<seg id="1629">The case of the improper Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer in late June had announced that he has been supplied to hospital for liver cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009 Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (state jeure), after having placed himself on the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that the democratic reforms in China had demands.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The State Department in China has called Lius case as "an internal affair" and tells a speaker, he did not notice it as "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">However, China continues to meet calls from the international community, Nobel laureates and his wife, poet Liu Xia, freeing or allow him treatment abroad.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem silly, as Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Justice Minister K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark in the blogosphere has triggered a debate.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Office of the State of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore, because it is compared with other countries in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He support that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a Democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is where most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we may be different.</seg>

<seg id="1694">"" "the Blog Cavalierio accused the judicial Minister," "" "rotate logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifics to create this valuable land you can say that we are not in no country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded as vulgar, it had the semblance of a flight before the responsibilities, a must-breaking.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, and eating land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons for Shangrgam led reasons were not very nobles: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other "normal countries, given the one, it appeared invariably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">But he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently managed by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core point of the topic, the good old lyre emerges from the authoritarian rulers to be instructed democrats, leave the twisted logic, since they adapts better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end of the final week of Shangrgam there were given answers to his American guests with regard to our press, our Juristative, our political system really non-responses.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding questions cloaked it with non-answer type.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shangrgam to illustrate his opinion as they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">When Singapore is no country, but a city is, thus to which country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful if our werter K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point unless it was paid high in order to be part of the government of the City of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By reading his comments on the blog, he points to the reviews that you should begin to read the entire co-ordinating of the conference so that you can better understand the context of the statements of Shangrgam better, according to which Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>

<seg id="1804">The post-war society is only very slow in East-East Asia, especially in the Tkuarchal district.</seg>
<seg id="1805">It has now been over 20 years, since the Georgian-abchashic war has been officially completed, but his fools are still highly visible in this part of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of the northern districts in Tkuarchal show striking images.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages like Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharchilava are located in the coal-basins of Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, shutters, Georgians and Armenian lived and worked together to soviets in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their houses during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, the majority of Russians and deportations live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also referred to in AbchAsia as well as spirit-cities.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war era, more than 10,000 people lived here today, there are only a few hundred people in these ghost cities.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the 16.000 people had risen more than a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 some 43,000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1904">The hotel has no less charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 Dollar per night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with kills, britty walls and beds made of metal.</seg>

<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities region in the West of China are forced to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July the mobile users at the Tianshan District, the city of Urumqi received a cell notification in which it has to install the District Government, a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>

<seg id="1964">However, kònn the authorities use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because shortly after they had the app to install messages with a private Weaver group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police, the app would determine the sources and the distribution of terrorists, together with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blockade pornographic web pages, from online scam, Trojaners and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to remotely control their own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filtering for minors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these features can naturally be used in many different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" state actors or even hacker can enable the home network to manipulate or steal it from it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages about digital censorship primarily focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often bleak for those who live in distant, pressing ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and dissatisfaction in the conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme ups and surveillance measures as well as routing internet deactivations.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The findings of Twitter-Outlet "Images from the mainland China" (callback home), the censored messages in China released, showed photos of a checkpoint, at the police officers "subsequently transferred if they had the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure the people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>

<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a backbone for the technological development.</seg>

<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computers and Handys in Xinjiang become an electronic handicap.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City of Party Council, to minimize the circulation of illegal contents.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government agencies, government agencies and related institutions including universities and research institutes are obligated to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office during operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A later report of Freedom House, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned this new monitoring methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang the authorities on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi announced a regulation to all residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August their "personal ID maps, manual, external drives, notebooks, notebooks, and media memory cards" register with the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos," however, this action does hurt the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for quite a number of other possible deception, including those that relate to peaceful religious or political notes.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordan Rapper Emsallam Hdaib covers the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends much of his time inside; sometimes he sander to his canvas, to his computer, and once again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can leave is a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine to discover lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top of his family house, which belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel was completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family were forced to flee from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as feliyeen (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">"" "" "" "for six years Hathaib is a passionate activist who presents itself to the conservative majority and questioned their altproven opinions on gender issues, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and Rapmusic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, who often deals with issues such as orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues do not only be found in his hometown of Amman Relevance but also in cities that are rich in Damascus by far to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With its 25 years, Hdaib sees itself as a man who has not restricted in his mind by borders, and he may mitigate the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not give it openly, he defeated a particular disinclination against the US-American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks for his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his sympathy goes to those who try to do in war areas, something to do with its identity as a 'Palestinian fray of the second generation - so he called himself, even if he was born in Jordan and never was in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I do not think about my own lives," "" "stressed Hashaib" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think that because I am a man," while he shook in water with this Nescafé in two cups; it's the holy month of Ramadan. in this time it is planned for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordian law also states that the public intake of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for it to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a senescent hot junk has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the muddy warm coffee and the sweeter of the Kent-cigarette in the nose, first and foremost of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when looking into neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, one avoids to do basic things - to drink basic things - just as they drink in the public during Ramadan, not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the House of Jordaniens has cancelled an appearance of the band Mashrou 'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians who support the Islamic Action front - the jordan branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of homosexual incisers Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional standards of the country and be the main reason for concert collusion.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former spokesperson in the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that was told the concert "just" because of the sexual orientation of the Sangaroo.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many argue that the involvement of the band in affairs such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world be dangerous activism that questioned the Ancient-proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement Mashrou 'Leila the jordian people as "progressive supporter of human rights," which continue to use "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement may not be simply probed in Rhetoric, but actually a clearly reflected in crystallizing reality in Jordan which occurs in Hdaibs's work clearly.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hevaib traditional sex men led to Leibe by creating his vision of the fate of Arab women who have vorehelichen sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The image shows the skeleton of an apparently distorted lady, their arms and legs down to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those they actually should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past few years, the number of 'honour morde' has increased - the unofficial outside is left intact.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch predicted the number of winners in 2016 in 2016; however, it is still horrific that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to assist women who tried victims of murder or domestic violence in order to provide appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on the ground control by the year 1954, women who are exposed to the risk of inner-family violence, "and for her release is often a years of bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee from the family necessary that the woman has nothing to happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Too Hdaibs music is very popular with popularity and is known for it, not to be back in front of issues that are long standing in his country as tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib is argued that his work is political, but is a fact that he is his music, who is full of explicit assessments on sexuality, freedom and expression, does not separate from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Near East, Man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">To me politics was born, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" "" "Ghareeb" "", "the focus is on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of the songs, which are in the core of political will be further.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"" "in March 2016 Hdaib published a song with the title" "" "Santandano" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated many times:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is also." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market in which one can get in his words, "what you want" - be it faith or non-faith, Hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noticed that hardly any someone talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still heavily censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular Jordan Onlineage Roya, to later notice that his comments from the context was torn, distorted and his opinion were censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but has been only a working version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intriance to homosexuals do not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuke, a poet of the eighth century, who still has stayed in memory today thanks to its homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nusomething that was later to work on behalf of the calibration, in the eighteenth century could openly write about homosexuality, why can I do that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila, or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the haschematic realm there is nothing new that the government has sanctioned on freedom of expression and that progressive voices will be silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Still recently, in January 2017, the Javanese news service held several former government officials and members of the teacher, with the reason they have expressed themselves on comments in social media and related to the problems that were deeply rooted in the Land with the deep within the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Given its view, the concert of Hdaibs believes that only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring structural changes in the next generation of the Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a continuous giving and taking. Jordan has revered Mashrou 'Leila now for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - it looks long, precious and inner changes. it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the jordan Society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, also from an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He dreamed of doing his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of what they experience. "</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is going through the use of music, art and literature a genuine and basic openness - and not by bombs, spreading and artificially manner. at least, he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the end of this, Hdaib will resold and therefore also resist.</seg>

<seg id="2150">These great, extravagant warriffs are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One suspected that it is celebrated a variant of Tanabata festival that is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohocus. a further theory asserts that the drums and dancing over more than a thousand years have been handed over and from a time come to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi to force in the knees.</seg>

<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to develop more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hairstyles, who can trace these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>

<seg id="2181">The following article is the revised version of the Beitrags "Liebesbotcies" guerrilla "which has released the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">This article will be published as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write just love-letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not yet much more important, people who make themselves trapped to do affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question went to the two young Colombian activists from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth-Stiftung not anymore from the head and inspired it to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliación (letters for reconciliation), the young people were killed, guerrillas, guerrillas letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, her land was a place of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to its part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had a peace treaty with the Guerillabweation FARC (German: revolutionary forces in Columbus), which forms the scaption of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International saw the submission of the peace treaty, as important that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received his merits for his merits to Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="2188">"" "" "" "however, a long way to be able to speak of a true reconciliation and peace." ""</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters who have lived for many years in illegal camps, were exposed to a war rhetoric, and around the clock their weapons, must now be restored to life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society in turn, which had used to live in constant fear and in some cases deeply hatred against errilla warns, they have to record them in their ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombian needs to join forces and would need to help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that is exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for any former guerrilla fighters - that should be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters for reconciliation was carried out at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize, which took place in February 2017 in Bogotá. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize at 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we love the people we love, on Valentine's thousands of love writing, but those forget that they need much nicer.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He quad, he retired, to share his love with people this year, which necessitates the most urgent response.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus, the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former warriors of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and to build up a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian company is willing to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Up to date, more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major towns of Columbus such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">"" "" "" "I never thought that someone would forgive me" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over in one of the UN's warehouse in the Caldono region in the region of Caldono-Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students at the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city council of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation BogotArt traveled in the camp to give letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC rated as they had done earlier in order to face the precepts of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of sub-care of people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very eventful moment for all parties involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that dabetween lies," the political knowledge of Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a co-assistant of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we had passed the letters, me led me a former warrior through the camp of the guerrilla warriors.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuck" (a kind of cabin, where the errilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla fighters who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because beside him on the bed was a MGL-pomegcher, a deadly weapon in the Dornröschenschlaf.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I said to him yet," "" "hello, what do they do?" "" "answered," "" "I answered on a letter that someone has written me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life someone has written something so nice, so I response to it. "I suddenly gave me the tears over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I strongly impoverished it completely and set me next to the pomegectors.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of pity, I was tired of having all the years of faithful companion of this fighters, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC, the only way to preserve him and his six brothers in front of the hunger tod. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society out there that is waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">So far, I just learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace is igns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the prelude came to students and some guides of the FARC to a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC already died in the hiding place.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC the history of the organization, their ideals and gave an insight into their views on the peace process: "many years have experienced how the social injustice on the part of the state was emerging on the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to build ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to shape the society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a purpose of this scale, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Those people hear that had never been heard before and no voting rights, and to recognize that people who have often seen as monster and even hate who were shot by their lives and their environment was extremely painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country is alive, does me sore.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforting me that all men - even those who have killed and so much damage, let us teach us and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former warriors have responded to letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the town of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombianern was remittedly, that after the draining peace this would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there are inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to grab the weapons, rise up and to protest for their rights. and that's also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">"" "" "" "we from the FARC rely on peace on a policy without weapons." ""</seg>

<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those under us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>

<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, he made a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his chestrian friends, with the following message: "then there are no men more in Chechnya who can eliminate these shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">Afterwards the photos of my documents made the round of the WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"" "when I was just trying to bring some shopping from the backseat of my car, I heard a Male Impress:" "" "here is a gift for you from your uncle." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that there was a young man, no 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost the consciousness and woke the final end of the hospital again.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had everything and started to cry out.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was flying.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two keyrings in my right lung wings.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in what ambulances were you placed - in which men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name, but the doctor got up and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office, I got it to do with the fear; it was a Muslim, a causal name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he set himself as a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that it is respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got Drops.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightclub.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was attended by neighbors and some remote relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The requested to send me to Chechnya to prove that all that was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They said absurd demands: some said to me, I wanted to prove it by far without the roads; others wanted I was in the official television in Grosny and say that I had not changed my gender, that all was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have body-size C - what would I like to say in television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older men spoke to my mother on the road.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "They have brought a monster to the world that is not only your family, but the entire Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she lay down a strick around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later, under the window there was a car with a darkened window and a numbering plate with a 95.</seg>

<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to award its name but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the land, but then did something unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I just bought it, without sign me, without a reference, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came and checked out into the hotel</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>

<seg id="2318">I always say that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chatting with camera, I actually give myself to look like the person who recalls itself from their past - so to my male forms.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What are your friends, those who have remained dorton?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who has saved the one and a half months in the gun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that while Ramadan were not arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait to wait and he didn't lock out a new wave.</seg>

<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine said, there were just not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then especially those who have no rich relatives or have dropped out of their relatives to make a Kadyrows court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that you can present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be brought up, you will show your body on TV and claim they would have attacked any village or military base point.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply vanished, but submerged in order to radicalise itself.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now only a fault, or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I had just someone who was detained in Argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was no news of them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They have simply taken them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was even when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as a bandits, in addition there has been no reports yet. we suppose that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would you not have allowed these people to shave yourself?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation, already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always carried my hair for long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya, I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known quite big, when I lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was considered, I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>

<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were tore; I had stinged lashes, carried away Tubular and short Tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The safety Ministry of Sharia has never made me a hair even more.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, a whole group of people met me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several ribenches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a phrase: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Accotto does not mean over the unhappiness of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">You often say it to children if who make themselves more than sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just have her eyes closed before you, because they believed, you are sick?</seg>

<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace take time?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak on television on morality.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us per se, but rather on the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, one could feel the people in the city started to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Who had smiled and laughed before, viewed you on once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I got back home, I could feel how the situation in the Republic is steadily wormering.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I did not make much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">That also I am still working as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">At present I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacup, gathers, I begining it to the hospital and help them to get Essenskarten.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have not been a penny for a long time.</seg>

<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is important.</seg>
<seg id="2383">This is the nature that has purely nothing to do with religion at all.</seg>
<seg id="2384">That is exactly the same as Chanians who want to present you with foam in front of the mouth that there is no swamped in them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have those who have Kabardiner who have the Russians also which; on the whole planet there are - but not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">I am from there, so it is unpleasantly surprised, just what to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fasting during the Ramadan - live with men together.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Do you know, many think with transpacy to men who love men, and they believe that one changes its sex to gain more intimate experiences. but that's a chest.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of sensation in order to be precise, different habitats.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm going to be personally personally, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>

<seg id="2489">Inhalt1 beats and Statistics2 Unseen abuse and a judicial system, which is nothing special immon3 Paraguay laws: good approach, deficient implementation, blows and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is difficult to determine how many women are really misused, says Myrian González, researcher for genderask at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are various data and reports, which, however, do not even indicate to show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, at the District-state department of 9600 ads continued because of domestic violence. at 70% of it, it was about violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads in the police came by women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in peace-dishes. also here came 86% of the adverts of women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads said 40% of women, that they were physically demanding, 55% of women spoke of mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics however do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayan women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually displayed. "on any woman, which may be refunded in Paraguay because of mental abuse, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "on any woman, which may be refunded because of physical abuse, two women who do not do this," "" "declared it at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since emancipher in Paraguay is not an own offence, the enforcement authorities cannot be adequately documented how many women become assassinated any year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Until August 2016, journalists were at least 12 cases of women's genocide in the country alone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator of Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women have been murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates die in Paraguay all ten days a woman due to violence caused by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible abuse and a judicial system that takes nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez has been the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called his name to him all of her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning they didn't want it, but then there was still. this should be her forever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old and no longer work with Carlos. but two years she bore the mental violence against women, while the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognizing the most severe recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I have never thought that I would once again be victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read earlier about it, I always thought that only women happens to be subjecting because they fool themselves from violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse through Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship and told how he had insulated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their posts, including Carlos themselves. he asked rhetorisch if he ever had the hand against them, and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had fallen by Carlos so long and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had a certain extent to blame.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos that did not come from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with authorities in Paraguay, to prove that their former partner had misapplied them.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te creo ("I believe") which consists of women all in any way of abuse offences.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences to listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victoria's case all started with mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Their prosperous partner eventually managed to convince them that they were worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he started to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria ads with the authorities did without the result and also from their relatives, they received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It led to a trial against its former partners who developed into an inconsistent legal struggle between Paraguay and her native country, in which it was mainly about money, power and influence of their former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguay laws: good approach, deficient implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws, which are very good but are not used.</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016 in the paraguayan Parliament, a bill was discussed, known under the hashtag # PorEllas (# Fürth).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# non-income) are part of a campaign on Twitter, supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original design of the law looks ahead, Femigd to explain an independent penftment-continuance and tougher to punish as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the legislation was changed in some points, in order to also win members for the law, which feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions are paved, which are currently banned in Paraguay, and punished with up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill introduced, most of the (bureaucratic and economic) moving costs incurred by the victims of violence by present themselves, if they just want to apply, and would like to receive a secure accommodation, to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law is not effective if the law does not provide sufficient financial resources for this purpose:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, abuse is seen as a part interpersonal relations.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here a rethink has to take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something Normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">"" "" "" "those who are silent in view of these facts is guilty and contributing to the perpetrators of the perpetrators." ""</seg>
<seg id="2538">We need to refund so long you until abuse is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law in the paraguayan Senate has been adopted, however, parts of the law has been modified; however, there was a passage of passage that included the partners in cases of domestic violence for reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes will go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section regarding reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for aggressor to re-attack his prey.</seg>
<seg id="2542">The filing of words "gender", "political force," and "sexual harassment" from parts of the law applies as much backstroke.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture happens with his permission</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media. it is an increasing area that addresses the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need on site-performing medical research. there are two reasons for a lack in the range of global health, many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far better effects in the poorest countries in Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for studying these diseases from the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research, which is conducted by African scientists by establishing own research capacity in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is director of central centror in the centre for research on Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, particularly when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he searched itself on HIV virus that he decided to go back home to support the sambic health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misconceptions of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: the main focus of my work on the application of research results. at the moment I support the sambic national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Moreover, I just strengthened a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think are the most important current themes in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we only set solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always stay receiver instead of being Macher.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions that we get are often not appropriate in our environment, and sometimes it's impossible to use it here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists to projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are very well supported.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It's difficult to find people who want to come back or want to draw here because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">Which obstacles are there in your routine research that you did not previously had?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries. it costs much money, a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratories is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: how is the public opinion of science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how big is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa what should they focus on, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There are need for special scientific training, starting in every age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The social sciences, computer sciences, big data, research of the space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe us the advantages and cons of life as scientists in Africa from western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">LW: often there are the limited speed, things to do, and the complicated access to scientific expertise which represent here challenges.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that periodically make articles available only against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also limited the amount of availability and the speed of research.</seg>

<seg id="2629">Frank Morton was bred in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredgeous, the first plant that is cultivated and consumed by NASA Astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For nearly 20 years, Morton's work was achieved only by his own ingenuity and the question how many salvents can get there.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But beginning of the 2000s, he remarked that more and more Salads have been patented and that he could not use it further for the breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only available for individual types, but also for certain properties such as resilience to diseases, a special red or green leaf.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years more and more such patents have been registered on more plants such as cereals or carton locations. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts are providing food security to the future of food production.</seg>

<seg id="2638">And if they stand in court, no one can breed any new saline, because all the characteristics are already patented, "he's doing so well as possible and tries to breed those characteristics he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and strives to use no material that is protected as a intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">It has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the U.S. and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("open source").</seg>

<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather than it would come out of the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source Seed Initiative (Initiative for "Open Source" -seed) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, which provides alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was brought to life to ensure that some plant types and -gens are not protected as an intellectual property and are permanently usable for plant breeders permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2646">Within the framework of the initiative, in short, Ossi, can also commit itself to US breeder that others can use it freely freely from them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds, and they can sell them. "open source" breeders only allow others who buy seeds, to breed, and not immediately prosow out - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant patent or prescribed.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the Emeritus Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-executive member Jack Kloppenburg are in control of the seeds and the possibility to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds, according to him, plays a role in larger cores like biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter or only little by bred seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open source" movement is not busy with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, corn, genetically altered or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "to buy our goal of ecological sustainability, in addition to the most recent examples the interpretations of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer, which is offered in August and September 2016." who is a good, locally and sustainable producing vegetables, should also know that the way it is breeding is breeding.</seg>

<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi-supporters argue that the future of food supplies is jeopardised because the available copool is due to the ever numerous intellectual property rights based on plant material, which is thus always available to be reduced, unableness.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive of the Ossi, has engaged himself in her doctorate with genetic variation with carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all cartoufles has been protected as a intellectual property, making it available for plant breeders either at all or only usable.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there are still no such estimates, but experts like Luby suspect that mass-incision plants as wheat is patented in a bigger scale as a salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of point of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred that they are targeted their desired features - of such, through which their taste or colour improved until such, due to which they hold in certain environments, and threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeder through more and more patents always decreases. genetic diversity is currently unnecessary than ever since the altered conditions are worse by climate change are far worse predictable.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail "Monsanto-Sprecherin Carly Scaduto that genetic diversity is important and also decisive for Monsantos activities. with a total of four Genbanks and the cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company will implement the preservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts that intellectual property reimburse other breeders, as" "" "patents and the protection of plant quality innovations." "" "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expires." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method for the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "such protection does inhibit innovation not, but encourages it to be provided by the public more material and know-how." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees that differently: 20 years to wait until a patent is moving, certainly not innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you are waiting for such a long time to breed plants, adapted to the changing environmental conditions, you could have lost the fight already.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general public and should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor the money for such formalities and monary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what motivates us and it will be impossible if we can't continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">Altogether, Morton is bothered by Morton to patrons in the concept, "We created the characteristics not really itself.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form they themselves and as breeders, we are ultimately no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, Planzenzüchterin in the US-State Oregon and Ossi-executive member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who bred a sorting and chd his own values into them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures should be needed for cultivation as such as Herbizide, who are bred in his sorts of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is precisely the case. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that are moving on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, they create the majority of smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they refuse to patent or hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for a breeding garden of Salads.</seg>

<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeder through the Avoid of pesticients of innovative things: "it looks like I am using my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that patrons.</seg>

<seg id="2721">Still, the Egyptian authorities still unlock content on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it hit the website of an human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend around the 05.August, the Egyptian government has documented the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documented human rights abuses in Egypt as well as the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">August published the network an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities criticized for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information abbt- despite this attack and the perpetuation of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities to release the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it was never as important as it is now. ANHRI confirm that all technical possibilities will be postponed to overcome the block and not emulate. we insist on to fulfill our task further.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is regarded as the first ardised website of an human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities planned more than two months 21 websites, such as the independent news page MADA Masr, Arab-speaking edition of Huffington Post and the Qatar originating network of Al Jazeera because of the alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>

<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, there is also no access to the blog of the Colomnisten and human rights researchers Ahmed Gamal Ziada.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the spread of columnists and articles, which he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he initiated to get the censurors of the Egyptian government, even the aim of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider at which also Ziadas blog is native, on the other hand it is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, was spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after having been arrested by Egyptian security workers in December 2013, and recorded a video how the police exercise of physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles mainly focus on politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed itself to the block in the block and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The, blogs to block is very old, however, has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, so it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It was able to give me the feeling of a revolt condition; a decency, a subreeder murder, unloading at the national Security Council, the barrier of blogs as well as any other web page for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proved that I wrote not otherwise. in other words, my words have an impact, if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used to post the post of articles in order to avoid the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after they have blocked him and they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog yet.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The Muehl continue the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thence and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities from May 24 to August 06.

<seg id="2743">AFTE also document the blockage of vendors, which was possible through the processing of internships and private browsing, so called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12 we noticed how the interruption of web pages that offer VPNs.</seg>

(...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, so that we as journalists do not close our eyes before cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, the chief editor of the newspaper, that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>

<seg id="2768">We recognise that a war discrete when it is distorted to also be used, atrocities of the police, who first shoots and then asks questions to cover.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based upon information and the fight against corruption in police, whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" mean more than they have been useful?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil argued the journalist in Cecília, to designate the violence as "war." this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy through the media, and could make it difficult to account the police force.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>

<seg id="2888">He worked for a few years in a coal mine. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his little reward, and went to Iran. once again he found himself in a foreign country with other refugees and slugs with mortar who were heavier than he himself, in order to earn his livelihoods.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran were characterized by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," recessed Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the site, on which we worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we suspended toss in front of the open windows so that we do not refresh at night. "</seg>
