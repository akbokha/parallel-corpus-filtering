this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize at the Pul@@ itzer Prize .
long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book , in which he was spectacular released , that the N@@ SA were illegal teleph@@ ones of Americans .
but it is a different chapter which should make a lasting impression .
he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA lied to Iran literally dra@@ fts for an atomic bom@@ b .
if the crazy sound , you can read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter did not fall ?
the U.S. government .
for nearly 10 years the government against R@@ isen is determined and asked him to call his alle@@ ged sources .
in this move he was a symbol of condemn the pattern of the government , wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers to judge and journalists .
according to the first un@@ constitu@@ tionally , the media have the right to publish secret information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is impossible to use this right if the media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the Mu@@ eller which they give . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so when the government at R@@ isen , he did something that many cour@@ ageous re@@ por@@ ters had already done before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison .
so from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go to prison .
however , just days before the process , it happened something exceptional .
suddenly , although it has been years for years , that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the Government were dropped .
the reason : in time electronic monitoring , the re@@ porter and springs can always hide less .
instead of bringing and rus@@ hed to statements , they could do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators have expressed itself , without his consent , his telephone ach@@ ers are geh@@ eim .
just as his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its credit information , and even travel @-@ wise with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Ster@@ ling , a CIA wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower and risk of being alle@@ ged source .
unfortunately this is just one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower in his sight . but instead , the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem particularly because the government is part of their work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article about national security was the result of being a wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower to a journalist .
so we are putting the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first un@@ constitutional system , because the government has more and more possibilities to sp@@ ose out all .
but as the technology of the government permits the rights of repression , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and indeed , they can pick up that from the moment they get in touch , instead of in retro@@ spect , in the witness .
today , there are communication software which had not yet been written as R@@ isen , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ drop , an open source trans@@ ference system for wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers , which was originally developed by the internet @-@ famous Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I work , further developed .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , just like in every single contact form .
these will then encryp@@ ted and stored on a server that only has the respective timetable .
so the government can no longer auth@@ ori@@ ze the government , and many of the information they request would not be available from the outset .
Sec@@ ure@@ drop is only a small part of the whole , to protect freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se us all .
it is to us to ensure that not only technology denomin@@ ator like Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to asser@@ t mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers .
who wants to en@@ vy about ab@@ norm@@ alities during the supply of soldiers who wants to report and crowded hospitals , the alarm to contamin@@ ated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street Insider , who war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only for those who want to un@@ cover crimes , but to protect our of all constitutional rights .
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the biggest dat@@ le@@ ck of history was released . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; was unveil@@ ed that Rei@@ che and Gre@@ ater &#93; have been hidden by news about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents in Panama - Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents provides a small insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies like Mos@@ elle Fon@@ sec@@ a go and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an an@@ onym@@ ously company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the entire system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister has come back .
there are also reports that a allies of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ators Ba@@ ar al @-@ Assad letters @-@ companies in tax hav@@ ens has .
it is said that a lane of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin goes on a close friend from kinder@@ garten , one of the most famous C@@ elli@@ sts .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are waiting to wait for the next release , and to the next un@@ covered documents .
now that sounds like the plot of a agency or a John @-@ Gr@@ ish@@ am @-@ Romans .
it seems cri@@ es away from you , my ordinary people .
why should we address this ?
but the truth is , if the rich and powerful ones are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , roads .
and this concerns all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax hav@@ ens are used by some few to hide and conce@@ al their assets -- something that we have been discussing and unveil@@ ed for ten years .
I think many people seems very conf@@ using this whole world and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ger .
so one has a firm in another company , in another company that makes it nearly impossible to really understand who is behind these prayers .
it can be very difficult for criminal prosec@@ utions and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really understanding what matters is .
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this issue in the US .
pres@@ um@@ ably because there were no prominent American so far in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens .
but through the principle after which these tax hav@@ ens work , Mos@@ l Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
could we have a dat@@ le@@ ck of the Cay@@ man Islands or even of Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples to have connections to the US .
in fact , it is so that in some US states less information needs to provide less information to start a company than to get a libr@@ arian .
this type of in@@ transparent in the United States has allowed the employees of the deb@@ tors to rip school children .
it has enabled sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off particularly an@@ dis@@ rup@@ tive investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like .
how does this actually work ?
so we sent a deck@@ ed investigations into the offices of 13 commercial firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ators gave themselves as a African minister who wanted to bring more money into the US in order to buy a house , a private jet .
so it really sho@@ cked that everybody would be able to put on a lawyer of our investigations , as he could be transferred to his money .
these were all pre@@ di@@ ments . none of these lawyers participated as clients , and of course no money has been handed over to us . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer , who has not endor@@ se the proposals .
it is not about a single leader p@@ unch , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , by corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and instability .
and to cope with this , we must change the rules .
we must change the rules in order to ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ate this kind of behavior .
this may sound very soft , as if we could not do anything against it ; as if nothing ever had changed , as if it &apos;s always the rich and the powerful .
but when it is bor@@ row@@ ed , I certainly see that some has started to change .
over the past couple of years we have seen violations of more transparency what the owners of companies are concerned .
the topic found political attention through the British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU captured in central regi@@ sters at the national level , who truly is behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the USA is lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a bill of law in both parliament , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we would really like to see how this Panama disclosure , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the U.S. and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who are angry if they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ firms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need managers in business that arise and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and work for it through laws that end this kind of in@@ consistency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together , we can finally end this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing , finally quit .
this is the story , as I once kid@@ n@@ apped almost and in the trunk area of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I finished my design study , I made a back@@ yard .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da remained there and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my art@@ works .
he was alone in the city and made a road trip all the land . afterwards , he would go to the Nobel Peace .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you feed this day ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , Man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a seat now ?
but I just got to know him . he said , he would go to peace @-@ flops , but I don &apos;t know if he &apos;s really planning . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk area of a ma@@ zet !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have a air matt@@ resses . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ h , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was in bed , I stuck to the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh guy ! what have I built in myself ?
a wild foreign sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I got such fear that I rose from the bed , che@@ at the door and closed my bedroom door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the artwork , which he purchased from me depends today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my view@@ point .
maybe people who were sold me in childhood as foreigners were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air matt@@ resses , has been normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air matt@@ resses .
let &apos;s take a time out , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost bank@@ rupt , my ro@@ omm@@ ate draws up and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe creativity can create it to transform fear in fun .
I wrote my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I survived how we could earn something to do . our apartment will stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a site and founded so called air matt@@ resses and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happ@@ ier guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air@@ brush on wooden floors .
they found it super , and we too .
I am sure our cheese ham @-@ O@@ mel@@ et decor@@ ate completely different because we made them for our guests .
we travelled with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door into the castle fell , rigi@@ d Brian and I call .
did we just discovered that we find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent ?
the things came in the roles .
my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out whether to make it a business concept .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way we presented ourselves to the investors : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to post a website , on the people publicly post of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of rooms whose doors can be reached when you visit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
about the internet they can then invite stran@@ gers to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we wa@@ ited that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
but in fact they do not .
nobody who is still at Tro@@ st would invest in a shop where foreigners is allowed to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we have learned as children that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
if one has a problem , you get on the things you can do . we could des@@ ig@@ ate .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to des@@ ig@@ nt objects , but now we wanted to establish design immense confidence between people who had never met before .
can design play such a thing ?
is it possible to create confidence with design ?
I would like to give you a pay@@ ast@@ ing , which degree of confidence we desire .
it is a 30 @-@ seconds experiment . it will force you out of your com@@ for@@ one .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
type your un@@ lock phone on your left seat .
this quietly approach to panic you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts are feeling when they open the first time the door .
because the only thing is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked cell phone of a fore@@ igner in his hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
so also most guests feel when they stay in elsewhere .
only for this reason , our company can exist .
just so , who has actually written Al Go@@ res Mobile ?
could you announce the position of the President on Twitter for the Office of the President ?
you can now return the phones now .
you now have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had been subject to a small detail on this experiment ?
what if your neigh@@ bor would have imagined only once with his name ; if he tells us how his dog or his children would be called ?
imagine , you would have 150 Be@@ ur@@ ents that all say : &quot; he can really be very well un@@ sealed phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to post your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ thought@@ ful feedback system strength@@ ens the confidence key .
at the beginning we have made some things wrong .
it was hard for the people to complete negative evalu@@ ations .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosted and guest had placed their jud@@ g@@ ments before we created them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we tried , how probably it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are in terms of age and place of residence .
little surprising we trust the people most , who are most like us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bi@@ ases .
exciting it is exciting when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by evalu@@ ations .
if you have less than three evalu@@ ations does not change anything .
but one has more than ten , changes everything .
a good reputation is common .
so the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep @-@ rooted preferences .
furthermore , we ro@@ de that confidence depends on how much you cost .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if you say too little , such as &quot; Hi ! , &quot; one gets rather no answer .
one tells you how , for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is also rather not accepted .
so there is an optimal degree of openness , for example &quot; Tol@@ le art@@ works in your apartment ! I do with my family vacation . &quot;
how can we create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which subjects you should write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudi@@ ces against stran@@ ger .
what we had not reck@@ oned was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people are using our offer .
you can recognize three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second , the ti@@ reless efforts of our team .
thir@@ dly , a need that had not been un@@ covered before .
for us , the business is just very good .
of course , there are also times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have un@@ allowed parties to have celebrated or rented apartments .
hosts have guests in the rain stand .
in the beginning of the project I have worked on the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood on the front front , when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than this calls . it already happens when I just think it .
the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the sei@@ fer , was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve ourselves .
fortunately , from the 123 million , nights only a fraction of a problem had ever been a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for people trust each other to be right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when confidence works , there can be mir@@ ac@@ ulous .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his hosts took him in the hospital .
he even ended blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travellers , who are til@@ ted due to their activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real refu@@ ges that save lives , even though they are not familiar at all .
you drive to hospital in your own car when you die , and wait while one gets a b@@ yp@@ ass .
because they don &apos;t want to feel lonely , they bring books past .
they leave a even longer stay without the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course not every stay .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this concept for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with cash transactions work together ?
it is a matter of economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is now simply to call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rent industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people place a part of themselves open , and this changes everything .
when you travel nowadays , the Fast Food is to be compared . it is efficient and reliable , but therefore less authentic .
what if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if at any place you have visited , have visited a group there waiting to show a thoroughly rin@@ se and one at a pub drive which one has never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed based on privacy .
what if we would like to create apartments from the ground up to inter@@ locking ?
how would this look like ?
what if cities would assume a thought from shared ?
I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of lon@@ eliness and de@@ preci@@ ation .
in South Korean , Seoul , this project has already begun . many parks , which the government belonged ,
were now residents offered . students who were looking for a b@@ lei@@ gh ,
were transferred to people whose children were drawn up . there were inc@@ ub@@ ators .
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a fore@@ igner or even hosts .
the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was brought to us .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality there were also before .
there were similar websites to us .
so why has just our works ?
apart from luck and Tim@@ ing , we suggest that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find that amaz@@ ingly ,
quite overwhelming .
I have to think every time a red Maz@@ da is over to me .
of course we know that design can not solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great impact , I wonder what we will be able to use design for .
thanks .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , a brain @-@ la@@ under@@ ing , a terrorist mil@@ itia ?
or simply a delay in safety at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you debt for your negative impressions .
this is how the media portra@@ ys people that look like me .
one study revealed that 80 % of reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans do mean , most would not know any Muslims .
probably the people do not speak with their u@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never experienced a Muslim : it is great , you know .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee @-@ owner -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a se@@ ag@@ er@@ ers @-@ Fitness @-@ fan@@ ati@@ cian ,
and I am a practic@@ ing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga s@@ ings , because , baby , I was not born this way .
I have decided to do this .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ ten .
no , not as a hom@@ osex@@ ual person , as some of my friends , but as Muslim min . I chose to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head@@ gear .
my femin@@ ist friend@@ ships were horri@@ fied : &quot; why oppressed you yourself ? &quot;
the Lu@@ stige was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist Declaration of Inde@@ pendence , and in relation to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt to a perfect and un@@ reachable beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have with the cor@@ ridor .
I read it , thought upon , was questioned in question , doub@@ ted and believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow devot@@ ion that deep@@ ened with each reading of the Quran .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I know myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
have you ever had the feeling that somebody you perceive , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ?
this is how it feels .
later I married and began , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineering .
I later , after my marriage , a child , and lived basically the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then came that horri@@ ble morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was sitting in my kitchen , had at the end of the breakfast , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ il@@ let &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in building , people b@@ ran@@ ches out of the buildings .
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock rapidly turned into sensation .
why should we do something like that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I joined the &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not only my country attacked but in the N@@ u transformed me the actions of others from a civil into a susp@@ ects .
on the same day we had to travel through the Middle West of the US in order to draw up a new city and begin with the process of building .
I remember how I ro@@ cked -- so deep it went in my seat spot , and I was afraid to be recognised as the Muslim .
we moved into our apartment , in a new city , in which it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I saw , and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sei@@ zed in well illumin@@ ated areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gath@@ er@@ ings not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a target . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting .
the feelings were understand@@ ably troub@@ led and I also heard of attack on Muslims or from people who held responsible for Muslims , in the outdoors .
there really was Bran@@ dan@@ os on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who had attacked this land have attacked our country .
I have put the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to go along constantly .
I have nothing to ask questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today we can actually say people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak about my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ our is one holding only under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tum@@ our in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , ob@@ sth@@ and and Olympi@@ oni@@ ken .
will make the closing of mos@@ ques America safer ?
there will be maybe some parking , but not the terror stop .
regular visits to a mosque , to see people in other faith , and to show greater citizens &apos; participation .
and as director of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
you will radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed before a computer .
in the radic@@ alisation process , one has noticed that it starts from her church , even by her family , so that the extrem@@ ist will make a brain @-@ la@@ under@@ ing that the person believes that terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who desp@@ ises their behavior and ideology , is a tra@@ itor or the belief .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we have to stop the people to go to the mosque .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
eventually a group like the IS justified its brut@@ ality with the cor@@ an .
as Muslim , as a mother , as a man , I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add ourselves to their employment world when one recogni@@ zes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim@@ ing their ideology reasons to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if one thro@@ ws a look at it , it does not drive what they &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; las@@ en in her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets you read these things in the Scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding I@@ mam told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she would like to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said that the problem was just the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom they had talked , she brought to silence , and said that their wrath , their sense of in@@ justice in the world , would bring them only into trouble .
of nothing inspired and something that had been given to their anger , she was a main target for the instrument@@ alisation by extrem@@ ists who talked to their solution .
this I@@ mam ordered the connection to God and her church again .
instead of supporting them for their anger , he showed her constructive way for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque known to join the IS .
this was an insight , like the Islam@@ opho@@ bia concerns me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect anyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day affects our democracy , for our thought of speech ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , pass at least three things .
we rather accept a author@@ itative system , con@@ formity and prejudi@@ ces .
a study reveals : if you have reported test articles where negative about Muslims have been reported , they can rather end military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circum@@ cis@@ ion of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look at when the mood against Muslims began ch@@ oss -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run of the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem @-@ terror as I expected it .
it can indeed be a tool for mani@@ pulation of the public in order to base the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and well @-@ informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning .
we might feel it perhaps as the first , but the toxic air of fear sh@@ ines us all .
in the assignment of collective fault , it is not just about having to explain themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple that lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a ath@@ l@@ ete .
he was on the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , very promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , gener@@ als Man , she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was aston@@ ished and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is of my frat@@ ernity become such a ver@@ sive young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Suz@@ anne near her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , she was mur@@ dered , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who was in the afternoon to visit . he did it in her apartment , as with a execution , after having posted expres@@ sions against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he slept eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be fatal , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque , or remain safe at home ?
we poss@@ essing this and for us it was not an easy decision because it was about to leave America to our children : one that would control us by fear , or one where we can freely prac@@ tise our religion .
we decided on the mosque .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with our son in the children &apos;s home we went silent , with high pressure on the mosque . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I took him out , went forth my shoes , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw , made me hold .
the hall was rest@@ less filled .
then the I@@ mam made a notice , thanks and called our guests , because half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , believers , believers , and non @-@ cre@@ ditors who came to join us , but to join us .
in that moment I am collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what are you to choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you go number for sure ?
or will you join those who mean , we are better than those .
many thanks .
thanks beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so Dal@@ ia , you seem to have met a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who might be claim@@ ing that you are going to keep an TE@@ D@@ Talk , a reason@@ ing with deep @-@ road , therefore an exception and not normally are .
what would you say to those people ?
Dal@@ ia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , do not dec@@ eive you . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
if we look at Muslims around the world , and I did it with the greatest ever carried out study to Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity to the family , they want to work and they want to live in peace .
so I am not an exception in any respect .
if people appear as an exception to rule , then usually the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . Dal@@ ia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for Bast@@ ler , is about to become a milli@@ liter business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial Dro@@ ps . made possible , this is done in research organisations throughout the world .
before air @-@ access to our social consciousness , a self @-@ sufficient fleet of flying machines in France live in front of an audience a six meters high tower of 1 500 bri@@ cks . a few years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es .
by inter@@ connecting people reach high speed and acceler@@ ation to narrow space .
you can also build self @-@ degrad@@ able structures .
you have learned to wear bur@@ dens , to deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and in general respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of what is possible in the autonom@@ ous flight .
so that a system aut@@ on@@ om works , it must be collective re@@ en@@ vy where the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at the E@@ TH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic banking .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a group of our lab@@ s .
there are no external cameras .
each machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , calculations to board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are at the highest li@@ ft@@ . for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flight , tried to hit two flies with a cap .
like other star@@ ters it is efficient in the advance excursion , much more efficient than helic@@ op@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters it can float , and therefore has great advantages with starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of tail@@ ors is that they react sensitive to tur@@ mo@@ il as Wind@@ bows .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft no matter where the optimum position is reg@@ ained and the performance can be improved by practic@@ ing .
okay .
during our research we often ask basic abstract questions posed to the heart of the matter .
such a question would be : what is the petty @-@ possible number of mobile parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helic@@ opter are known about as machines with thousands of movable parts that meet you .
decades ago , trained pilots have managed remot@@ ely controlled aircraft , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a p@@ eck@@ ru@@ der .
recently , we discovered that flies with just one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanical , easiest away , and it was invented .
it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no sub@@ folders , hing@@ es and Quer@@ ru@@ der , no further actu@@ ators or control @-@ surfaces , just a prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , happ@@ end in the inner live very much so that it can fly stable and move in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorith@@ m of the rear rigi@@ d . to bring it to the flies , I have to throw it correctly .
the lik@@ eli@@ hood to throw it right when I look , is low , so I &apos;d like to show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
if the moon is a exercise in pleas@@ ures , this machine is here , the om@@ head with his eight prop@@ ellers , a exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this flow ?
you see that it is only symmet@@ ric .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
thus he will receive the proper ability ,
moving in the room in all directions , no matter which direction he is filmed or even how it rot@@ ates .
of course it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some is adjustable in models , the rest will be learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s see that .
when flying machines should be part of our day @-@ day , they need to be extremely secure and reliable .
this machine here consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft engines .
these turn in the clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the other against clo@@ ck@@ wise .
when you build them together , they act like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ru@@ cop@@ ter .
however , something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- cannot fly the machine if limited .
we will demonstrate that by doing one half way .
the last demonstration is being examined synthetic swe@@ at .
the large number of autonom@@ ous , co @-@ ordin@@ ated units offers a range of aesthetic expression .
we took the usual micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than a sli@@ ce of bread -- and they provide them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no limit .
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the most safe machine is there to exercise on Broadway a flying l@@ amp@@ shade .
of course it is difficult to pre@@ ach the influence of this technology .
for types like us , the reward in the development and the creation act .
it serves as memory , how wonderful and ench@@ anted our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures allowing them to form in a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential , the ic@@ ing is on the cake .
many thanks .
a million holes in a very distant galax@@ ie two black holes are getting faster and more quickly , you conver@@ ts as the mass tri@@ er Son@@ nen in a t@@ enth@@ r@@ t@@ ann@@ ess in pure energy around .
for that short moment it brigh@@ tened them brigh@@ ter than any stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but their energy put them not in the form of light --
we finally speak of black del@@ ights .
the entire energy was released into the space @-@ time poem and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
when we arrange the events initially .
four billion years ago had just been multi@@ active life on the earth .
since then , the Earth has brought a lot of things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , Sau@@ rian , people and -- God stand by us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group was particularly cour@@ ageous -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech -- built a huge laser det@@ ector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them stopped for crazy .
but enough people recognized it as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades @-@ long development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the det@@ ector LI@@ GO : the laser inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ er- Gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ Observ@@ atory .
in the following time , the precision of LI@@ GO could be considerably increased , which improved the ultimate power output enorm@@ ously .
therefore , one calls him Advanced LI@@ GO .
at the beginning of September 2015 , LI@@ GO for a final test start to clear some smaller , stub@@ born problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black hole is through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ ghes : only two moments in my life were emotional as this :
the birth of my daughter
and the departure from my father @-@ sick father .
basically this was the fruits of my life .
all that I worked for is not longer Science @-@ F@@ ic@@ tion ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ ghes , theoretical physi@@ cist on the MIT . he has been studied Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black del@@ ights and their by observ@@ atories like LI@@ GO meas@@ urable signals . but what are Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a scr@@ aps in the texture of space and time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passing the wave , the space and its entire content is stretched in one direction and stri@@ pped into the other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to illustrate , lec@@ tur@@ ers in courses at the rel@@ ativity @-@ The@@ ory often have a really alber@@ go dance .
&quot; stretching and dust , stretching and du@@ sty . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridic@@ ulous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and stopped by us at the rising of waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is called 20 N@@ ul@@ len after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . Dar@@ um , one declared the LI@@ GO staff for nuts .
with a five kilometres long laser det@@ ector , and that is already absurd , this length had to be measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nuclear nucle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gravity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of the Light , the hunt at the waves : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties when building such det@@ ectors are rap@@ tured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but physi@@ cists are inv@@ enti@@ vely and with the help of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to LI@@ GO . Scott says , LI@@ GO is more a ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible Light has a wav@@ el@@ ength that is much smaller than the things around us : face prints , the size of your phone .
that &apos;s quite handy . because so you can make a picture or a map of things by taking advantage of several points coming around you .
on tones it is different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that &apos;s why it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things you mean particularly much :
the face of your child about .
instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as sound base and height , rhythm and volume , in order to close the history behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now speaking to Alice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ my Bob &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same goes for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot produce any simple pictures of objects in the space with them .
but by making modifications in the amp@@ lit@@ ude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least lie for LI@@ GO the common frequencies in the audi@@ ble area .
if we convert the same pattern in shock , we can hear the All literally .
the gra@@ v@@ itation to listen , can tell us about a lot about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , my colleague Scott has been working for a very long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , circul@@ pen easy : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two body very fast , you hear the same circle with an additional tone change . this sounds so on : W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u !
it is a kind of movement @-@ matt@@ resses , shaped into the w@@ ave@@ form .
AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date , that at least I &apos;ll never forget -- I heard the sound of -- SH : ... two black del@@ ights with each 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which turn about as quickly as the ro@@ ds of your Mix@@ ers .
AA : think of what this means .
two black holes , the dense body in all , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 Sonic , cir@@ cl@@ ing for one hundred times a second before they col@@ lide .
imagine these forces before .
fantastic .
and we know about because we have heard it .
therein lies the remaining meaning of LI@@ GO .
LI@@ GO opens up a completely new way to studying the universe as it has never been possible .
on this path we can listen to all listening and the invisible .
much in all we can -- virtually or basically -- do not see .
a Super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ted stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about all of them .
the exciting physical processes happen at the core , which lies behind thousand kilometres of iron , carbon , and si@@ lic@@ on .
we will never go through , because these op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big Bang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the alarm , but we will never see it because the urine is covered by its own desc@@ endant .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves should be possible to look back at the beginning .
and most importantly : I am optim@@ istic that we have never seen in all things we have never seen before we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we just discover by hearing .
in fact , LI@@ GO immediately found in the first stop that we did not expect .
my colleague at the MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project , says to this topic : me : the type of stars that bring black holes , like LI@@ GO they ob@@ serves , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
you are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . black holes are so called the Sau@@ rier@@ bones for our archaeological work .
LI@@ GO allows us to create a completely different angle of view of the events in space , the creation of stars and ultimately also how we emerge from this chaos .
AA : the challenge is now to be as cour@@ ageous as possible .
thanks to LI@@ GO we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and p@@ ses of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in all .
because what could be more beautiful than listen to the urine ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , bringing me in unpleasant situations , I am forced to say yes &quot; Yes . &quot;
wanted to speak in the public ?
no , but yes !
wanted to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I start playing with the show ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes , yes .
and a mad thing happened : just do what I fear , but I fear my fear .
my fear , speeches to hold , my social fear -- d@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes , that changed my life deeply , to an unexpected item It started with a question of my youngest .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls for un@@ explained reasons all &quot; estim@@ ating &quot; ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimate , I need milk for my schn@@ apps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she asked me once I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new attitude to my family . from there I wa@@ ited to play with them once you ask me to do so . no matter what I just do , or where I go , I &apos;ll always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I am not perfect , but I am very happy .
it has a magical effect on me , to my children , to our family .
but it also has a tricky side @-@ effect : only recently , I actually understood that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play my career with my children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think things out , aw@@ ake to life .
dream job .
no . I am no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I kre@@ ire television . I re@@ produce television .
I make TV , on a large scale .
in this TV season I am responsible for achieving 70 hours of programs into the world .
four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each program offers hundreds of jobs that had not existed before .
the budget for a TV episode can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode shows all nine days by four shows , i.e. all nine days of 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three transm@@ issions , at the same time four episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series are running on Thursday nights .
all over the world , my series production runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spect@@ ators .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I myself created and not only produced , so still ob@@ end@@ ent . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and to tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours TV , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who is still doing ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I would not like to impress you .
I say it because I know what you think , when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you so that all of you who work so hard whether you are speaking a company , a country or a household , I seriously suppose that I &apos;m not just around your computer and fant@@ asi@@ ly , and it &apos;s true when I say , I understand that it is not dre@@ aming in a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , everything work , everything &apos;s reality , all blood , all swe@@ at -- no tears .
I work hard , hard and I love it .
when I am deep@@ ened in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work creates always a land from nowhere .
it is when I set troops on , when m@@ old I went to a canvas .
so , you see a high sound , ran a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ onc@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , fun and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cru@@ el and rational , and the best thing , is the sums .
there is such a change in me if the work is running well .
a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows and the sums stops like a busy road I could go for ever .
many people assume when I cl@@ ing to them the sums that I &apos;m persu@@ aded writing that writing me pleasure .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , what does it do .
but the sums of men began when I started working and working with television production when I started working and working together , build , to create and work together , I discovered this thing , this sums , this energy .
the sums is more than writing .
the sums of money is action and activity . the sums up is a drug .
the sums of money is music . the sums of light is light and air .
the sums of God is the voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sums , you cannot differ slightly from the size of the size .
the feeling of being cannot be different than stri@@ ving to size , no matter what price .
this is called the sums of money .
or maybe it also means a work@@ a@@ holic to be .
maybe it is called genius .
maybe it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I do not know .
I just know that I am not made for failure , and I just know that I love the sums .
I will only say to you , I am a Titan , and I know that I will not want to question it .
to make it clear : the more successful I will , the more episodes , the more work there , the more work there , the more work there , the more the more I write story , the more I write story , the more expectations there is .
the more I work to be successful , the more you have to work .
and what do I say about work ?
I love work , not true ?
the country , which I sho@@ cked the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the sums up .
I like this sums . I love the sums .
I need the sums . I am the sums .
am I only this sums ?
and then it stops the sums .
revised , over@@ exposed , exagger@@ ated , burned .
the tot@@ als stops .
now my three daughters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that her mom is a single work@@ book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my mother will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimate , I want to go to Sh@@ onda country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are the children of a tit@@ ans .
these are Baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sums were stopped .
the Sum@@ men of the engine is silent .
I did not love my job anymore . the engine was off .
the sums did not come back .
my sums was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans @-@ work , 15 hours @-@ days , thought@@ ful weekends , no Reu@@ e , nothing deleg@@ ate , a Titan sleeps , does not give up , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no Sum@@ men .
in me there was silence .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show @-@ show ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
all I did .
I was the sums and the money I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly let ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some people think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ano@@ int@@ l dich , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Author @-@ Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what you do , you do , you love what you do to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a painter , Bill Gates , you simply love another and that gives you the sums if you knew the bu@@ men already , when the sums stops , who is one then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
I still have a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , you are playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I will not say No , when two things are being aware of :
first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she called me not &quot; estim@@ ating . &quot;
it calls no more &quot; estim@@ ation . &quot;
when is that happening ?
I miss it when I am Titan I and my sums , and here everything is changing my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , you are playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; yes . &quot;
there is nothing special .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and her sisters , we lau@@ gh a lot and I read more dramatic in the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing exceptional .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in the lon@@ eliness and lack of money , I can do nothing but to match .
I am focused .
I am quietly .
the land which I sho@@ cked the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are stick@@ y fingers and wet k@@ isses , delicate voices , wax @-@ pins and the song in which it comes to dis@@ let , or whatever the girl goes into &quot; The king@@ d@@ oms . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe I at@@ me .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me causes itself .
a mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in .
and that not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sums comes slowly back .
no full noise , hardly there , it is quietly , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the sums , but a sums .
and now I feel like I would know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the cause .
it is love . that is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sums , the working environment , the tit@@ anium @-@ converting , this is only the substitute .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I &apos;m descri@@ bing of broad@@ casts and television hours , and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sums of money is .
money is not power and it is non @-@ specific .
it is dependent on the pleasure .
true Sum@@ men is dependent on love .
the sums of life is the stream , who comes from life .
true Sum@@ men is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real sums have ignored the pressure of the story , the tasks , the expectation and the pressure .
the real sums of money is simple and original .
the real sums of God is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but I perhaps whis@@ pered with God the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a little bit more love , much more love .
once my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I rule that as a work@@ a@@ holic can free myself as work@@ a@@ holic .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice unless I want to hear the sums .
I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I like it .
playing is not appe@@ aling to me as work .
the truth does hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I am always working , because I love it .
I prefer working at work as at home .
this admission is painful , because what kind of person might be working as a home ?
well , I .
honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of it .
we slept in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst so@@ ap Bub@@ bles .
I also feel overwhel@@ med , ab@@ sent and confused .
I always cl@@ ing to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the Sum@@ men of the universe met me .
I play and play , until I ask myself : why did we ever hear with the games ?
you can also say it ! tell them always yes , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you think me for nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dreams .
you probably have right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child can be found less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my children want to play at a maximum of 15 minutes with me , till they stir@@ red up to them that they want to do something else . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes I replaced a Marien@@ k@@ äfer or K@@ eks .
and my teenage daughter all 15 minutes long with me , I am the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , more requires it not .
everyone can set 15 minutes a piece , even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no di@@ version .
the day is short : dinner , the kids finished .
but 15 minutes are dr@@ ink@@ able !
my children are my com@@ emp@@ athy , my world . it is not the children to be . it is true to have the tot@@ als to have a place for his soul peace .
it is not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
to play the &quot; Games &quot; in general .
allow yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find it out and keep it out .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I know and I vic@@ tories . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training when I wanted to exceed myself and more .
15 minutes in the play , why not full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the money came back in my spare time . the sums seems to return , if I am not working .
working is not working without games .
it takes time , but after a few months opens up a door that flow up energy , and I find myself in my office . I hear a unknown mel@@ ody , she fulfilled me and my soul . she betra@@ y@@ eth me to new ideas . I took it on its way and I love my work again .
I like the sums , but I do not love it .
I do not need it .
I am not the sums , the sums it is not ... no more .
so@@ ap Bub@@ bles and stick@@ y fingers , dinner with friends .
this is now my sums .
the Sum@@ men of Life .
the Sum@@ men of Love .
the sums of work is part of me but just one part . and so I am so grateful .
it is me that I am a Titan I . I have never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and to play more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fire are still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the more clearly my head .
the more I play , the better I am working .
the more I play , the more I hear the sums , the marathon that I have , the marathon , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the other , the right sums : the sums of life .
the more I feel this sums , the more makes this unusual , consistent , naked and new feeling of life in me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sums , the more I know who I am .
I am author . I think things out , I aw@@ ake you to life .
this belongs to the job , that means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said &quot; yes &quot; to less work and to play more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thanks beautiful .
I am neuro@@ surgery .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trag@@ e@@ dies .
I know how your life may change from one second to another , after a serious stroke or an automobile accident .
for us neuro@@ surgeon it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other bodily organs , has a very little ability to self @-@ healing .
after a severe violation of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , heavy disability .
that is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; surely they have heard of one of the most prominent , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep @-@ proof stimulation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; there is an electrical de deep in the brain to influence the switching cycles of the neur@@ ons so that neurological function improves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it truly is an amazing technology . she has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson which suffered severe pain and heavy pain .
Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however means not Ne@@ uro @-@ curing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close enough .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a leit@@ ner@@ ist and worked night and night in the emergency .
often I have been cat@@ ered patients with Schä@@ del @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that at skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ mas , the brain is aff@@ lic@@ ted and the skull @-@ head @-@ pressure decre@@ ases .
to save lives , you have to l@@ essen the skull @-@ pressure .
considering this , one sometimes has to remove a part s@@ wollen brain .
instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze ourselves with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to leave cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
the cells of a tissue growth can be achieved , is comparable to all small children that are taken out of your families .
one has to find the proper diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to make it thri@@ ve .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts @-@ made it Jean @-@ François .
that was what he saw under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise to us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
perhaps you can still know from the bi@@ ologi@@ e@@ unterricht that stem cells are un@@ ri@@ pe cells that can transform itself into each cell type of the organism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the grown brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it is surprising to receive this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain cells in the surgery .
we made a further fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells thought different .
they spread slow and after a couple of weeks they did even die .
so we saw a new , strange g@@ inal population which looked like stem cells , but looked different differently .
we needed long to understand where they came .
these cells are from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called cel@@ ains cort@@ is@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
you make 4 % of our grand@@ mother rin@@ se cells .
you play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fo@@ etus , they ensure the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know that .
we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain , as we find it in higher concentr@@ ations near the brain .
but this is not so secure .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source , the bra@@ ins healing .
this is what we had to prove .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ speaking area , and then the cells had to cultiv@@ ate exactly the same way as Jean @-@ François did
and they afterwards mark stat@@ ute to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we re@@ im@@ planted them at the recording of the same individual .
we call the autonom@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re@@ im@@ pl@@ ate these cells in normal brain tissue , and what will happen if we re@@ im@@ pose the same cells in the dig@@ it brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkey .
in the first scenario , we re@@ im@@ planted the cells in a healthy brain , and we watched that after some weeks they disappeared again , they go back home . the room is already occupied , so they will not disappear , so they disappear .
in the second scenario , we put an injury to and re@@ im@@ pl@@ ed exactly the same cells , and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were re@@ im@@ pl@@ ated .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells we colored in vit@@ ro in the culture .
here we could not stop there .
can these cells also help a monkey from a brain injury ?
so , we trained monkeys with a manual work@@ piece task .
you had to take feed @-@ p@@ ell@@ ets from a tablet .
they made them very well .
when they had achieved a stable skill level , we moved in the motor Cort@@ ex the Hand@@ mot@@ ori@@ k section .
then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move her hand .
just as it would happen in people , it reco@@ vering spont@@ ane@@ ously to a certain degree , just as after stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechan@@ isms . they are reco@@ vering to some degree , just as in the monkey .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , im@@ pl@@ anti@@ ed we had his own cells .
on the left you see the monkeys that reco@@ vering spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now , see the cells re@@ im@@ pl@@ ated : the same monkey , two months after the Rei@@ m@@ plant@@ ation .
I can tell you , which were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can free@@ ze it and use later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example at Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ pose her upon the people .
I really hope I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself .
many thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , which is wonderful , I &apos;m sure right now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think , &quot; I know someone who can need that . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question of what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on the human being .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the greatest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill about two k@@ ilo@@ grams of papers and forms , in order to run these kinds of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
JB : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical studies . if you continue to look into the future as many years , until someone can come to hospital , and this therapy will be available .
JB : it is hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will it take us the authority to start it soon ?
then you need to do this study with a small group of patients .
it already takes a long time to choose the patient to perform the treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
after that , one has to apply to a multi @-@ centric study .
you really have to really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . JB : natural .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , thank you for visiting us and that you have told us of it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy . and Democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as natural .
we do not see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant that is in reality , but as a invent@@ aris of our society .
we tend to consider them as un@@ changing tissue .
we believe that capitalism is inev@@ itably led to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and its big offspring in Beijing have demonstrated no doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politicians remains completely un@@ democratic .
indeed , the democracy is d@@ wind@@ ling with us , in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beginning of the year when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear to me as a financial minister in the Euro@@ group -- our elections -- not to influence the austerity programmes that were implemented in Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment I thought there might be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my thought@@ ful friends , told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if they would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask you to make sure that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save ourselves to democracy , but that we need a true and defen@@ cel@@ ess democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for without democracy our societies become Gem@@ ma , our Future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies .
on the subject , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction , which is currently under threat to our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tw@@ ins top parad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the Schul@@ den@@ berg , who casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all know the Schul@@ den@@ berg ,
yet few recognize his kenn@@ el .
a mountain of un@@ exploited cash , which are however too anxi@@ ous to invest in , where it would be productive and income would be , with which one could produce the Schul@@ den@@ berg and also produce all the things that urgently needs mankind , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months , 3.4 tr@@ illion expected US dollars is invested in all the wealth produced goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , streets , G@@ le@@ ise , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 tr@@ illion US dollars sounds like a lot of money , until one compar@@ es it with the 5.@@ 1 tr@@ illion U.S. dollar that were around at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing else except for exchanges and the real estate prices .
thus , debt and in@@ productive capital form the twin summit , which are not the same through the usual market mechanisms .
the result are stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe , and , consequently , encourage the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , who would not invest in which they do not invest . just like Ö@@ di@@ pus Father , who is out of fear , the prophec@@ y of the o@@ rak@@ els could be true that his son would kill him if he will grow .
un@@ certain the circumstances leads , which lead to that Ö@@ di@@ pus kill him k@@ ills .
this is my ha@@ st@@ ating with capitalism --
his extremely sp@@ ant species All the un@@ productive capital should be used to continue our lives , to develop human talents and to finance especially all of the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial to save the Earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
I think already . but before we proceed : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ eles defined democracy as the public form , in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course , closed to many of --
women , aliens , and of course slaves .
but it would be a mistake to min@@ ate the status of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these conclusions .
the decision @-@ making at the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that she gave the working arms , and not only the right to freedom of expression , but is more important and decisive , that they gave them the right to political co@@ ding with the same balance in matters of state cou@@ pling .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not lasted long --
as a cand@@ le , which lights very bright , it is also fast exp@@ elled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , our liberal democracy have not made their roots in the ancient Athens , &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has concentrated on the free citizens , and the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for ruling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible , and the democratic process is limited to politics , while the economy -- is the world of corporations -- a democr@@ ati@@ cism zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in our modern democr@@ acies , the separation of politics and economics began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two instead of putting the economy into politics and escap@@ ed them .
are you wondering why politicians are no longer as they used to ?
it is not up to the de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is because one can be in the government nowadays and not in power , because the power of politics is w@@ ander@@ ed into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my ha@@ st@@ ating with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is in about such a flock of prey , which is as sustain@@ ably the animals , of which they are nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ ating that they are star@@ ving at the end .
it is similar to the economy , affecting the policy so far @-@ ni@@ b@@ alised , that it grows due to the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of corporations grows , political goods is increasing , the economic demand falls and the managing director of corporations are too anxi@@ ous to invest the cash of their business .
the more successful of capitalism sells the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the twin @-@ elements , and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity of humanity .
if that is true it is obvious that we have to bring back the politics and the economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keeps control so as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist Left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it didn &apos;t go along well .
the teaching of the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor is only to reg@@ ain a position like in the ancient Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : to manage the working arms !
capitalism does it by doing Ni@@ ed@@ ri@@ glo@@ hn@@ ening through automation and robots .
the problem is , so long economy and politics are separate areas , the automation process is higher , the waste , and social conflicts are deeper , as it is -- already very soon as I think -- in countries like China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we need to re@@ organise the economy and re @-@ unite the economies of the economy and politics , and in doing so that we are democratic in a disease @-@ based surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that lets the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a documentary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements that he has brought forth , will survive --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is dis@@ solved through a D@@ yst@@ opy , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; in which machines serve man and people stuck up their energy into the exploration of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians , in long talks to the meaning of life .
I believe we may be optim@@ istic .
what does it mean , how could it look , these &quot; Star Trek &quot; -@@ like u@@ topia rather than the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ like D@@ yst@@ opy ?
in practical implementation I would like to give you some examples shortly .
in the area of companies , please ask a capital market where you earned money , while you work and in which your capital will help you from a job to the next , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those who work in the company .
then , all income deri@@ ves from capital and from dis@@ solve and the concept of wage labor is completely out@@ dated .
no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but do not work in it , and employees working there where the company doesn &apos;t belong . no bar@@ gain between capital and labour , no big g@@ aps between investment and hair , and ultimately no cont@@ empor@@ ating tw@@ ins .
in the field of global political economy , please just imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is trad@@ ed in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade defic@@ it or the commercial distribution of the respective country into a common fund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also imagine that this fund is invested in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment means are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time one had not had the technical means to implement it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have it , particularly against the background of a re@@ united politics and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world I describe to you is at the same time liber@@ ary , in which it privileged people preferred , and Marxist , because they buried the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ an , global key@@ n@@ esi@@ ology .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
will we watch in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar cy@@ st sc@@ opy ?
the answer depends on how we work together politically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better democratic .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you are descri@@ bing your biography in your biography than liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and business is ... do not do this , technological development will produce a massive decline in the economic demand , which represents Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as a &apos; long term st@@ agn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from a part of Earth to the next one we &apos;re currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our democr@@ acies , but also the countries whose interests in liberal democracy is minor .
if this analysis is correct , Marx is quite relevant ,
so as Hay@@ ek , so I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also completely fil@@ tered .
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t want to be , one does not think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a sort of ph@@ ilosop@@ hic declaration -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers , you have said very clearly what you think about the view of the West in China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the sem@@ blan@@ ce of democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics during the area where most of the world plays , -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone in the area .
in some ways , if I may say that pro@@ voc@@ ative may , China today resem@@ ble the England of the 19th century .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for -- we remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error , historically considered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
it was particularly skep@@ tical , affecting the democratic development .
what can be observed now in China is very similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China now propose to do what the West has done in the 19th century , rie@@ ve to hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many list@@ eners are in@@ quis@@ itive about your experiences as a finance minister in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I know that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half @-@ year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very dis@@ appointing , because we had the opportunity to start with the eurozone a new beginning ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely , we say goodbye to the self @-@ suff@@ iciency , and the di@@ gest denial that a massive mer@@ ging line ran through the eurozone and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal was to reveal this denial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is correct . unfortunately , the forces within the eurozone , within the European group , continues to deny the denial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you are trying to preserve a business that is not viable , by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , you might be able to delay it perhaps a while , but when the change occurs , it happens to the core and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see in advance ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who look back -- seriously ...
if there is a finance minister , or any Minister , who after 6 months in office , claims , particularly in such a ten@@ se situation , he made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistake .
the greatest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt that there was an honest interest on the sides of the len@@ ders to find a common solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that was not .
they merely wanted to bring about our government , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the ship@@ ments carried out by the Eurozone .
they did not want to admit that they have been cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nomin@@ ee GDP .
there is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; neither from the Troika &apos;s len@@ ders who raised us these policies to stand by : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ s@@ ical error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive table of talks , you seem to be quite a pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming to someone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the eurozone is not survi@@ ving .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if they do not survive , the free &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sham@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will not have disast@@ rous consequences for Europe but for the world economy .
we are probably the most powerful economy in the world .
if we comply with ourselves the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , that it appears to me , it will be as det@@ ri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you will be wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thanks so you were at TED .
Y@@ V : thanks .
by Roy Price , most of which have never heard , although he is probably responsible for 22 mid@@ ful minutes of your life on April 19th 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
it goes back to the decision which he met Roy three years ago .
Roy Price is a leit@@ ant at Amazon Studios ,
the TV @-@ production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has a I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the show and the content out of Amazon .
of course this is a very hard @-@ war industry .
there are already so many TV series that Roy can not select any one .
he has to find shows , which are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are right on the right of this turn .
this curve is the assessment distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the I@@ MD@@ B website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are received this review .
if your show is evaluated with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- all the shows , which ad@@ dic@@ tive , your brain asks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , are shows like &quot; Tod@@ d@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- which should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price does not take care of at the left side of the curve , for I think you are already taking special intelligence to provide &quot; Tod@@ d@@ lers and Ti@@ aras . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the average exter@@ mination , the average television -- the shows which are neither good nor bad , they do not am@@ a@@ ze it .
so he must make sure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is available , and of course it is also the first time Amazon makes something , that &apos;s why Roy Price does not risk .
he wants to make success .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a contest .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where they can look at any cost .
and if Amazon otherwise are out of stuff , one can still hold right ?
millions of viewers look at these episodes .
however , they don &apos;t know that they are observed in the look of these shows .
they are observed by Roy and his team who take all of them .
you record when to start the show when you &apos;re p@@ auses , which parts you can jump and watch again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process these and from it the answer and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
you made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many of these show can remember , because it was not so good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is only an average @-@ show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of this curve gets 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- therefore something above average , but not exactly what was going on for Roy and his team .
about at the same time at another company , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always searching for this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it something different .
instead of holding a contest , he and his team got the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give the shows , their course , which shows them like etc .
then they use this data to find out these small details about the audience : which shows them like , which producers , which actors .
when they had together all the parts , they entered a wagon and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x thus has got a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 rating on this corner . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course is the question : what happened here ?
one has two very knowled@@ geable , data vers@@ ed firms .
they combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow reports that this should work with everything .
if you colle@@ cts millions of data for a decision you meet , then you should make a good decision .
one has 200 years on statistics as Back @-@ Up .
you are optimized using very powerful computers .
the min@@ de@@ ste , what you can expect is good television , or ?
when data analysis does not work , then this is something frigh@@ tening because we live in a time when we are able to grasp more and more to collect serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company multi @-@ health system ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come in touch with this software . come in touch with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison in the United States and ask for dism@@ iss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dism@@ iss@@ al is done or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it &apos;s decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , which can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results generated . this does not mean that a company like multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data de@@ al@@ est companies are sometimes false .
yes , even Google makes mistakes sometimes .
in 2009 , Google announced that they are able to predic@@ ate through data analytics for flu , predic@@ tions , predic@@ tions -- by Data Analysis of Google research .
it worked wonderfully well and was a great message sensation . the success was cul@@ min@@ ed in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked impeccable , year round year to year , until it suddenly doesn &apos;t work out ,
and no one could say why .
it simply doesn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data de@@ al@@ est companies such as Amazon and Google mis@@ understand sometimes .
despite all these errors diff@@ ers data in decisions of life - at work , in law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather ensure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ based gen@@ etics -- a territory where some very clever people use un@@ imagin@@ able amount of data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy
or the development of a medication . over the years I have recognised some samples over the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
have you ever need to solve a complex problem , just do two things :
to create this problem in its parts , so that you can analyze the parts ; as a world @-@ wide , you set up the items together to absor@@ b a resolution .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : to take apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help create a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to compos@@ e the parts and then come to a resolution .
there is another tool and we all possess it all : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to compos@@ e again , even if the information is incomplete , so when the brain is an expert .
that &apos;s why I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and mind , where they also go in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , why they otherwise would not have been able to put together , but the decision on how to put all these parts , bringing together a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; which was not in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon on the other hand did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all of their decisions , first as they who had a TV @-@ ideas , then chosen as the &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong , when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are only one tool and in order to not forget it , this device is quite useful .
many of you will be ...
before it gave data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ ap or no question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will leave it later with a technology demo .
I met some decisions in my life so far , whereby I should have heard the ball in retro@@ spect .
but , as you can , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it through something much more exact , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the land structure .
so perhaps the ball wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is up to us to make choices when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data still pays off , decision making , an expert in what you do , and risks .
for in the end , it is not the data but the risks that you end up at the right end of the turn .
thanks beautiful .
