<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize at the Pulitzer Prize.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book, in which he was spectacular released, that the NSA were illegal telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is a different chapter which should make a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">He describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA lied to Iran literally drafts for an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sound, you can read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter did not fall?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For nearly 10 years the government against Risen is determined and asked him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this move he was a symbol of condemn the pattern of the government, whistleblowers to judge and journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the first unconstitutionally, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "but it is impossible to use this right if the media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the Mueller which they give." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters had already done before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">So from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, just days before the process, it happened something exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although it has been years for years, that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the Government were dropped.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in time electronic monitoring, the reporter and springs can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of bringing and rushed to statements, they could do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators have expressed itself, without his consent, his telephone achers are geheim.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just as his e-mail data, financial and banking information, its credit information, and even travel-wise with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and risk of being alleged source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is just one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblower in his sight. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem particularly because the government is part of their work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article about national security was the result of being a whistleblower to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we are putting the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first unconstitutional system, because the government has more and more possibilities to spose out all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But as the technology of the government permits the rights of repression, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can pick up that from the moment they get in touch, instead of in retrospect, in the witness.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there are communication software which had not yet been written as Risen, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is Securedrop, an open source transference system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by the internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I work, further developed.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, just like in every single contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then encrypted and stored on a server that only has the respective timetable.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer authorize the government, and many of the information they request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">Securedrop is only a small part of the whole, to protect freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately governments around the world are developing new spying technologies that jeopardise us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is to us to ensure that not only technology denominator like Edward Snowden have an opportunity to assert misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers.</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to envy about abnormalities during the supply of soldiers who wants to report and crowded hospitals, the alarm to contaminated water of Flint. or a Wallstreet Insider, who warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only for those who want to uncover crimes, but to protect our of all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the biggest datleck of history was released.] [the "Panama Papers" was unveiled that Reiche and Greater] have been hidden by news about a Leck of 11 million documents in Panama - Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents provides a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies like Moselle Fonseca go and say," "" "okay, we need an anonymously company." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the entire system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has come back.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that a allies of the brutal Syrian dictators Baar al-Assad letters-companies in tax havens has.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is said that a lane of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin goes on a close friend from kindergarten, one of the most famous Cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are waiting to wait for the next release, and to the next uncovered documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of a agency or a John-Grisham-Romans.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems cries away from you, my ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we address this?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is, if the rich and powerful ones are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and conceal their assets -- something that we have been discussing and unveiled for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seems very confusing this whole world and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a matrjoschkapuger.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one has a firm in another company, in another company that makes it nearly impossible to really understand who is behind these prayers.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for criminal prosecutions and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really understanding what matters is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this issue in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there were no prominent American so far in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But through the principle after which these tax havens work, Mosl Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">Could we have a datleck of the Cayman Islands or even of Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples to have connections to the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some US states less information needs to provide less information to start a company than to get a librarian.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparent in the United States has allowed the employees of the debtors to rip school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has enabled scammers to rip off particularly andisruptive investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does this actually work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a decked investigations into the offices of 13 commercial firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigators gave themselves as a African minister who wanted to bring more money into the US in order to buy a house, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">So it really shocked that everybody would be able to put on a lawyer of our investigations, as he could be transferred to his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all prediments. none of these lawyers participated as clients, and of course no money has been handed over to us. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer, who has not endorse the proposals.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single leader punch, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, by corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules in order to aggravate this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very soft, as if we could not do anything against it; as if nothing ever had changed, as if it's always the rich and the powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But when it is borrowed, I certainly see that some has started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past couple of years we have seen violations of more transparency what the owners of companies are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention through the British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU captured in central registers at the national level, who truly is behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "" "" "representatives of both parties have introduced a bill of law in both parliament, but this does not make progress we would like to see." ""</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the U.S. and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry if they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headfirms.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need managers in business that arise and say," "" "Intransparent is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and work for it through laws that end this kind of inconsistency." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally end this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering, finally quit.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I once kidnapped almost and in the trunk area of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design study, I made a backyard.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda remained there and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my artworks.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made a road trip all the land. afterwards, he would go to the Nobel Peace.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where do you feed this day?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse," "" "I do not know." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, Man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a seat now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him. he said, he would go to peace-flops, but I don't know if he's really planning. I don't want to land in the trunk area of a mazet!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself saying," "" "I have a air mattresses. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "one voice in my head said:" "" "Fh, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was in bed, I stuck to the ceiling and thought: "Oh guy! what have I built in myself?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild foreign sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">"" "" "" "I got such fear that I rose from the bed, cheat the door and closed my bedroom door." ""</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork, which he purchased from me depends today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my viewpoint.</seg>
<seg id="121">Maybe people who were sold me in childhood as foreigners were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accommodate people on my air mattresses, has been normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a time out, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost bankrupt, my roommate draws up and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe creativity can create it to transform fear in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I survived how we could earn something to do. our apartment will stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a site and founded so called air mattresses and breakfast "[AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happier guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the airbrush on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure our cheese ham-Omelet decorate completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We travelled with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door into the castle fell, rigid Brian and I call.</seg>
<seg id="134">Did we just discovered that we find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came in the roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether to make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"" "in this way we presented ourselves to the investors:" "" "we want to post a website, on the people publicly post of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of rooms whose doors can be reached when you visit." ""</seg>
<seg id="139">About the internet they can then invite strangers to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But in fact they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody who is still at Trost would invest in a shop where foreigners is allowed to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learned as children that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If one has a problem, you get on the things you can do. we could desigate.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to designt objects, but now we wanted to establish design immense confidence between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design play such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create confidence with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a payasting, which degree of confidence we desire.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comforone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Type your unlock phone on your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quietly approach to panic you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts are feeling when they open the first time the door.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked cell phone of a foreigner in his hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So also most guests feel when they stay in elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason, our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who has actually written Al Gores Mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you announce the position of the President on Twitter for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had been subject to a small detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor would have imagined only once with his name; if he tells us how his dog or his children would be called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine, you would have 150 Beurents that all say: "he can really be very well unsealed phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to post your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-thoughtful feedback system strengthens the confidence key.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for the people to complete negative evaluations.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosted and guest had placed their judgments before we created them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We have conducted a study with Stanford. we tried, how probably it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are in terms of age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising we trust the people most, who are most like us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social biases.</seg>
<seg id="181">Exciting it is exciting when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by evaluations.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three evaluations does not change anything.</seg>
<seg id="183">But one has more than ten, changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation is common.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep-rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">Furthermore, we rode that confidence depends on how much you cost.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you say too little, such as "Hi!," one gets rather no answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">One tells you how, for example: "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request is also rather not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, for example "Tolle artworks in your apartment! I do with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which subjects you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against stranger.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we had not reckoned was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people are using our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless efforts of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Thirdly, a need that had not been uncovered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, the business is just very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are also times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have unallowed parties to have celebrated or rented apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain stand.</seg>
<seg id="204">In the beginning of the project I have worked on the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood on the front front, when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than this calls. it already happens when I just think it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the seifer, was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, from the 123 million, nights only a fraction of a problem had ever been a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">"" "" "" "for people trust each other to be right." ""</seg>
<seg id="210">When confidence works, there can be miraculous.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His hosts took him in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even ended blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers, who are tilted due to their activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real refuges that save lives, even though they are not familiar at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive to hospital in your own car when you die, and wait while one gets a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to feel lonely, they bring books past.</seg>
<seg id="220">They leave a even longer stay without the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course not every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this concept for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with cash transactions work together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a matter of economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it is now simply to call" "" "rent industry" "", "the thing is not fair." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">"" "" "" "Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships." ""</seg>
<seg id="229">People place a part of themselves open, and this changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel nowadays, the Fast Food is to be compared. it is efficient and reliable, but therefore less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place you have visited, have visited a group there waiting to show a thoroughly rinse and one at a pub drive which one has never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed based on privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to create apartments from the ground up to interlocking?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would assume a thought from shared?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of loneliness and depreciation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korean, Seoul, this project has already begun. many parks, which the government belonged,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now residents offered. students who were looking for a bleigh,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were transferred to people whose children were drawn up. there were incubators.</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a foreigner or even hosts.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be not as crazy as it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality there were also before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites to us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has just our works?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and Timing, we suggest that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find that amazingly,</seg>
<seg id="251">Quite overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think every time a red Mazda is over to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course we know that design can not solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great impact, I wonder what we will be able to use design for.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, a brain-laundering, a terrorist militia?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in safety at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you debt for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">This is how the media portrays people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study revealed that 80% of reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans do mean, most would not know any Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably the people do not speak with their uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never experienced a Muslim: it is great, you know.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee-owner -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A seagerers-Fitness-fanatician,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born this way.</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I met the decision to outen.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, as some of my friends, but as Muslim min. I chose to wear the Hijab, my headgear.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friendships were horrified: "why oppressed you yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The Lustige was: at that time it was a feminist Declaration of Independence, and in relation to the pressure I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt to a perfect and unreachable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have with the corridor.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought upon, was questioned in question, doubted and believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was confidence and slow devotion that deepened with each reading of the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Have you ever had the feeling that somebody you perceive, you fully understand, and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began, like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineering.</seg>
<seg id="289">I later, after my marriage, a child, and lived basically the "Egyptian-American dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that horrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"" "I was sitting in my kitchen, had at the end of the breakfast, looked on the screen and saw the word" "" "Eillet" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes flew in building, people branches out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was it?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock rapidly turned into sensation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should we do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"" "I joined the" ""... "Muslim terrorists" ""... "... in the name of Islam..." ""... "..." ""... "..." ""... "" ""... "" ""... "" ""</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my country attacked but in the Nu transformed me the actions of others from a civil into a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day we had to travel through the Middle West of the US in order to draw up a new city and begin with the process of building.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I rocked -- so deep it went in my seat spot, and I was afraid to be recognised as the Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved into our apartment, in a new city, in which it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then I saw, and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said," "" "be vigilant," "" "seized in well illuminated areas," "" "gatherings not." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="309">I saw the extensive reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably troubled and I also heard of attack on Muslims or from people who held responsible for Muslims, in the outdoors.</seg>
<seg id="311">There really was Brandanos on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who had attacked this land have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have put the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to go along constantly.</seg>

<seg id="320">"" "today we can actually say people:" "" "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims." ""</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak about my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor as a whole and a benign tumour is one holding only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumour in the body of the US, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, obsthand and Olympioniken.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will make the closing of mosques America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There will be maybe some parking, but not the terror stop.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visits to a mosque, to see people in other faith, and to show greater citizens' participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as director of the police in the area of Washington, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">You will radicalised in their cellar or in bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the radicalisation process, one has noticed that it starts from her church, even by her family, so that the extremist will make a brain-laundering that the person believes that terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who despises their behavior and ideology, is a traitor or the belief.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we have to stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Eventually a group like the IS justified its brutality with the coran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As Muslim, as a mother, as a man, I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add ourselves to their employment world when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">"" "both groups claiming their ideology reasons to their" "" "Holy Book" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but if one throws a look at it, it does not drive what they" "" "lasen in her" "" "Holy Scripture." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets you read these things in the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she would like to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said that the problem was just the opposite. every clergy with whom they had talked, she brought to silence, and said that their wrath, their sense of injustice in the world, would bring them only into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Of nothing inspired and something that had been given to their anger, she was a main target for the instrumentalisation by extremists who talked to their solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam ordered the connection to God and her church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of supporting them for their anger, he showed her constructive way for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque known to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight, like the Islamophobia concerns me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear every day affects our democracy, for our thought of speech?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, pass at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept a authoritative system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study reveals: if you have reported test articles where negative about Muslims have been reported, they can rather end military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at when the mood against Muslims began choss -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run of the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Moslem-terror as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can indeed be a tool for manipulation of the public in order to base the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and well-informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning.</seg>
<seg id="367">We might feel it perhaps as the first, but the toxic air of fear shines us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective fault, it is not just about having to explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple that lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was on the dental faculty, talented, very promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the sweetest, generals Man, she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was astonished and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when is of my fraternity become such a versive young man?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne near her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan who was in the afternoon to visit. he did it in her apartment, as with a execution, after having posted expressions against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He slept eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be fatal, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque, or remain safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We possessing this and for us it was not an easy decision because it was about to leave America to our children: one that would control us by fear, or one where we can freely practise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided on the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"" "with our son in the children's home we went silent, with high pressure on the mosque." ""</seg>
<seg id="384">And I took him out, went forth my shoes, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw, made me hold.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was restless filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made a notice, thanks and called our guests, because half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, believers, believers, and non-creditors who came to join us, but to join us.</seg>
<seg id="387">In that moment I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What are you to choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go number for sure?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who mean, we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thanks beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have met a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say to those who might be claiming that you are going to keep an TEDTalk, a reasoning with deep-road, therefore an exception and not normally are.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, do not deceive you. I am completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">If we look at Muslims around the world, and I did it with the greatest ever carried out study to Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity to the family, they want to work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am not an exception in any respect.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people appear as an exception to rule, then usually the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What started as a platform for Bastler, is about to become a milliliter business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial Drops. made possible, this is done in research organisations throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air-access to our social consciousness, a self-sufficient fleet of flying machines in France live in front of an audience a six meters high tower of 1 500 bricks. a few years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By interconnecting people reach high speed and acceleration to narrow space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-degradable structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">You have learned to wear burdens, to deal with turmoil and in general respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to cross the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">So that a system autonom works, it must be collective reenvy where the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at the ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic banking.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a group of our labs.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, calculations to board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are at the highest lift. for example" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight, tried to hit two flies with a cap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters it is efficient in the advance excursion, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starters it can float, and therefore has great advantages with starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of tailors is that they react sensitive to turmoil as Windbows.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the aircraft no matter where the optimum position is regained and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research we often ask basic abstract questions posed to the heart of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be: what is the petty-possible number of mobile parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known about as machines with thousands of movable parts that meet you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots have managed remotely controlled aircraft, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a peckruder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently, we discovered that flies with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanical, easiest away, and it was invented.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No subfolders, hinges and Querruder, no further actuators or control-surfaces, just a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, happend in the inner live very much so that it can fly stable and move in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear rigid. to bring it to the flies, I have to throw it correctly.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood to throw it right when I look, is low, so I'd like to show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the moon is a exercise in pleasures, this machine is here, the omhead with his eight propellers, a exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this flow?</seg>
<seg id="444">You see that it is only symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thus he will receive the proper ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in the room in all directions, no matter which direction he is filmed or even how it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some is adjustable in models, the rest will be learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of our day-day, they need to be extremely secure and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine here consists of two separate two-propeller aircraft engines.</seg>
<seg id="453">These turn in the clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together, they act like a high-performance quadrucopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- cannot fly the machine if limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that by doing one half way.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration is being examined synthetic sweat.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, co-ordinated units offers a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took the usual micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and they provide them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The most safe machine is there to exercise on Broadway a flying lampshade.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course it is difficult to preach the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, the reward in the development and the creation act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as memory, how wonderful and enchanted our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures allowing them to form in a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential, the icing is on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Many thanks.</seg>

<seg id="470">For that short moment it brightened them brighter than any stars together in all galaxies of the whole of us known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But their energy put them not in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black delights.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into the space-time poem and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">When we arrange the events initially.</seg>
<seg id="476">Four billion years ago had just been multiactive life on the earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the Earth has brought a lot of things: corals, fish, plants, Saurian, people and -- God stand by us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group was particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- built a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which are caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them stopped for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized it as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades-long development, construction, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector LIGO: the laser interferometer- Gravitational-Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following time, the precision of LIGO could be considerably increased, which improved the ultimate power output enormously.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore, one calls him Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, LIGO for a final test start to clear some smaller, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black hole is through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional as this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the departure from my father-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically this was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I worked for is not longer Science-Fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist on the MIT. he has been studied Gravitational waves from black delights and their by observatories like LIGO measurable signals. but what are Gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a scraps in the texture of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"" "" "" "passing the wave, the space and its entire content is stretched in one direction and stripped into the other." ""</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate, lecturers in courses at the relativity-Theory often have a really albergo dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dust, stretching and dusty."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and stopped by us at the rising of waves. the elongation of an average person was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is called 20 Nullen after the comma, followed by a 1. Darum, one declared the LIGO staff for nuts.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometres long laser detector, and that is already absurd, this length had to be measured in less than a thousandth of the radius of a nuclear nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravity.</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of the Light, the hunt at the waves:" "" "the technical difficulties when building such detectors are raptured." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are inventively and with the help of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott says, LIGO is more a ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible Light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: face prints, the size of your phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">That's quite handy. because so you can make a picture or a map of things by taking advantage of several points coming around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">On tones it is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That's why it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things you mean particularly much:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child about.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain characteristics such as sound base and height, rhythm and volume, in order to close the history behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now speaking to Alice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "dummy Bob" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The same goes for gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot produce any simple pictures of objects in the space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by making modifications in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least lie for LIGO the common frequencies in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">If we convert the same pattern in shock, we can hear the All literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation to listen, can tell us about a lot about the collision of two black holes, my colleague Scott has been working for a very long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, circulpen easy: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two body very fast, you hear the same circle with an additional tone change. this sounds so on: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement-mattresses, shaped into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date, that at least I'll never forget -- I heard the sound of -- SH:... two black delights with each 30-fold sun mass, which turn about as quickly as the rods of your Mixers.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: think of what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the dense body in all, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 Sonic, circling for one hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces before.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the remaining meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO opens up a completely new way to studying the universe as it has never been possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to all listening and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can -- virtually or basically -- do not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A Supernova, for example. I would like to know why masserted stars in Supernovae explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about all of them.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes happen at the core, which lies behind thousand kilometres of iron, carbon, and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through, because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the alarm, but we will never see it because the urine is covered by its own descendant.</seg>
<seg id="541">Gravitational waves should be possible to look back at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And most importantly: I am optimistic that we have never seen in all things we have never seen before we will never see and of which we have no idea. things that we just discover by hearing.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, LIGO immediately found in the first stop that we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at the MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: me: the type of stars that bring black holes, like LIGO they observes, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">You are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. black holes are so called the Saurierbones for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO allows us to create a completely different angle of view of the events in space, the creation of stars and ultimately also how we emerge from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and pses of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in all.</seg>
<seg id="550">Because what could be more beautiful than listen to the urine?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for one year I would say" "" "Yes!" "" "I feared." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, bringing me in unpleasant situations, I am forced to say yes "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Wanted to speak in the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Wanted to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a mad thing happened: just do what I fear, but I fear my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, speeches to hold, my social fear -- dff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes, that changed my life deeply, to an unexpected item It started with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls for unexplained reasons all "estimating";</seg>
<seg id="570">"" "as if they were a waitress from the south." ""</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "estimate, I need milk for my schnapps." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me once I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said, "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude to my family. from there I waited to play with them once you ask me to do so. no matter what I just do, or where I go, I'll always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I am not perfect, but I am very happy.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, to my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a tricky side-effect: only recently, I actually understood that the "" "" yes "" "" to play my career with my children. "" "</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think things out, awake to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. I am no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I kreire television. I reproduce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make TV, on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for achieving 70 hours of programs into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four television programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each program offers hundreds of jobs that had not existed before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for a TV episode can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode shows all nine days by four shows, i.e. all nine days of 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three transmissions, at the same time four episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series are running on Thursday nights.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series production runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I myself created and not only produced, so still obendent. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and to tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours TV, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still doing?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think, when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you so that all of you who work so hard whether you are speaking a company, a country or a household, I seriously suppose that I'm not just around your computer and fantasily, and it's true when I say, I understand that it is not dreaming in a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, everything work, everything's reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work hard, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am deepened in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work creates always a land from nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is when I set troops on, when mold I went to a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">So, you see a high sound, ran a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, tiring and intoxicating, fun and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and rational, and the best thing, is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me if the work is running well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows and the sums stops like a busy road I could go for ever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume when I cling to them the sums that I'm persuaded writing that writing me pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, what does it do.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums of men began when I started working and working with television production when I started working and working together, build, to create and work together, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums of money is action and activity. the sums up is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums of money is music. the sums of light is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums of God is the voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sums, you cannot differ slightly from the size of the size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of being cannot be different than striving to size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums of money.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workaholic to be.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know that I am not made for failure, and I just know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I will only say to you, I am a Titan, and I know that I will not want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make it clear: the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more work there, the more work there, the more work there, the more the more I write story, the more I write story, the more expectations there is.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more you have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what do I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, not true?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country, which I shocked the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums up.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then it stops the sums.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overexposed, exaggerated, burned.</seg>
<seg id="642">The totals stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mom is a single workbook.</seg>
<seg id="644">"" "Harper tells people:" "" "my mother will not be there, but you can write my Nanny." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "estimate, I want to go to Shonda country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">These are Baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums were stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The Summen of the engine is silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not love my job anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titans-work, 15 hours-days, thoughtful weekends, no Reue, nothing delegate, a Titan sleeps, does not give up, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no Summen.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me there was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show-show,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the money I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly let?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some people think:" "" "anointl dich," "" "The Author-Titan" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know what you do, you do, you love what you do to be a teacher, a banker, a painter, Bill Gates, you simply love another and that gives you the sums if you knew the bumen already, when the sums stops, who is one then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">I still have a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern state waitress" "" "put a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way out, late and she says," "" "Mama, you are playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I will not say No, when two things are being aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she called me not "estimating."</seg>
<seg id="675">It calls no more "estimation."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is that happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am Titan I and my sums, and here everything is changing my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mama, you are playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and her sisters, we laugh a lot and I read more dramatic in the book" "" "The Poops" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and lack of money, I can do nothing but to match.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quietly.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land which I shocked the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax-pins and the song in which it comes to dislet, or whatever the girl goes into "The kingdoms."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe I atme.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me causes itself.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums comes slowly back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full noise, hardly there, it is quietly, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the cause.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the working environment, the titanium-converting, this is only the substitute.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I'm describing of broadcasts and television hours, and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums of money is.</seg>
<seg id="707">Money is not power and it is non-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">True Summen is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums of life is the stream, who comes from life.</seg>
<seg id="711">True Summen is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums have ignored the pressure of the story, the tasks, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums of money is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums of God is God's voice in my ear, but I perhaps whispered with God the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">Once my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I rule that as a workaholic can free myself as workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no choice. I have no choice unless I want to hear the sums.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so simple. I'm not good in playing, I like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not appealing to me as work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I am always working, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at work as at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what kind of person might be working as a home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">We slept in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap Bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I also feel overwhelmed, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always cling to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the Summen of the universe met me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play, until I ask myself: why did we ever hear with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! tell them always yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you think me for naive, for a daydreams.</seg>
<seg id="742">You probably have right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child can be found less interesting than you think.</seg>

<seg id="749">After 15 minutes I replaced a Marienkäfer or Keks.</seg>
<seg id="750">And my teenage daughter all 15 minutes long with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, more requires it not.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can set 15 minutes a piece, even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no diversion.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the kids finished.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are drinkable!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my comempathy, my world. it is not the children to be. it is true to have the totals to have a place for his soul peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the "Games" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Allow yourself the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I know and I victories. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training when I wanted to exceed myself and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes in the play, why not full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The money came back in my spare time. the sums seems to return, if I am not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working is not working without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months opens up a door that flow up energy, and I find myself in my office. I hear a unknown melody, she fulfilled me and my soul. she betrayeth me to new ideas. I took it on its way and I love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I do not love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sums, the sums it is not... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap Bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is now my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The Summen of Life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The Summen of Love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of work is part of me but just one part. and so I am so grateful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is me that I am a Titan I. I have never seen a Titan, the journey to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and to play more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my campfire are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clearly my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I am working.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums, the marathon that I have, the marathon, the canvases, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the other, the right sums: the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sums, the more makes this unusual, consistent, naked and new feeling of life in me wide. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think things out, I awake you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This belongs to the job, that means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "yes" to less work and to play more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life may change from one second to another, after a serious stroke or an automobile accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeon it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodily organs, has a very little ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe violation of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"" "surely they have heard of one of the most prominent, the" "" "deep-proof stimulation" "". "there is an electrical de deep in the brain to influence the switching cycles of the neurons so that neurological function improves." ""</seg>
<seg id="805">It truly is an amazing technology. she has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson which suffered severe pain and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however means not Neuro-curing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close enough.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a leitnerist and worked night and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I have been catered patients with Schädel-Hirn-Trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that at skull-Hirn-traumas, the brain is afflicted and the skull-head-pressure decreases.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save lives, you have to lessen the skull-pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Considering this, one sometimes has to remove a part swollen brain.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze ourselves with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to leave cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">The cells of a tissue growth can be achieved, is comparable to all small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">One has to find the proper diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to make it thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts-made it Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">That was what he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise to us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unmature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you can still know from the biologieunterricht that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform itself into each cell type of the organism. "" "</seg>
<seg id="830">The grown brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to receive this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain cells in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a further fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells thought different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They spread slow and after a couple of weeks they did even die.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange ginal population which looked like stem cells, but looked different differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">These cells are from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called celains cortisin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">You make 4% of our grandmother rinse cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">You play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the foetus, they ensure the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they take part in the healing of the brain, as we find it in higher concentrations near the brain.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source, the brains healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">This is what we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to extract a piece of brain mass from the non-speaking area, and then the cells had to cultivate exactly the same way as Jean-François did</seg>
<seg id="853">And they afterwards mark statute to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we reimplanted them at the recording of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autonomous transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we reimplate these cells in normal brain tissue, and what will happen if we reimpose the same cells in the digit brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkey.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we reimplanted the cells in a healthy brain, and we watched that after some weeks they disappeared again, they go back home. the room is already occupied, so they will not disappear, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we put an injury to and reimpled exactly the same cells, and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimplated.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells we colored in vitro in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop there.</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells also help a monkey from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So, we trained monkeys with a manual workpiece task.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take feed-pellets from a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had achieved a stable skill level, we moved in the motor Cortex the Handmotorik section.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move her hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in people, it recovering spontaneously to a certain degree, just as after stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they are recovering to some degree, just as in the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, implantied we had his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkeys that recovering spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now, see the cells reimplated: the same monkey, two months after the Reimplantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you, which were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example at Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to impose her upon the people.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, which is wonderful, I'm sure right now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think, "I know someone who can need that."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question of what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on the human being.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the greatest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms, in order to run these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical studies. if you continue to look into the future as many years, until someone can come to hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it is hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it take us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you need to do this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It already takes a long time to choose the patient to perform the treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, one has to apply to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You really have to really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: natural.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting us and that you have told us of it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy. and Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as natural.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality, but as a inventaris of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchanging tissue.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism is inevitably led to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and its big offspring in Beijing have demonstrated no doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politicians remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">Indeed, the democracy is dwindling with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">"" "" "" "beginning of the year when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally clear to me as a financial minister in the Eurogroup -- our elections -- not to influence the austerity programmes that were implemented in Greece." ""</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment I thought there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my thoughtful friends, told me that democracy would be abolished if they would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"" "" "" "I ask you to make sure that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save ourselves to democracy, but that we need a true and defenceless democracy." ""</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies become Gemma, our Future gloomy and our great, new technologies.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction, which is currently under threat to our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twins top paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the Schuldenberg, who casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all know the Schuldenberg,</seg>
<seg id="918">Yet few recognize his kennel.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unexploited cash, which are however too anxious to invest in, where it would be productive and income would be, with which one could produce the Schuldenberg and also produce all the things that urgently needs mankind, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion expected US dollars is invested in all the wealth produced goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, streets, Gleise, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars sounds like a lot of money, until one compares it with the 5.1 trillion U.S. dollar that were around at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing else except for exchanges and the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus, debt and inproductive capital form the twin summit, which are not the same through the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result are stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe, and, consequently, encourage the pessimism of investors, who would not invest in which they do not invest. just like Ödipus Father, who is out of fear, the prophecy of the orakels could be true that his son would kill him if he will grow.</seg>
<seg id="925">Uncertain the circumstances leads, which lead to that Ödipus kill him kills.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hastating with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His extremely spant species All the unproductive capital should be used to continue our lives, to develop human talents and to finance especially all of the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial to save the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think already. but before we proceed: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the public form, in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy, of course, closed to many of --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, aliens, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">But it would be a mistake to minate the status of Athenian democracy due to these conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision-making at the Athenian democracy was and is that she gave the working arms, and not only the right to freedom of expression, but is more important and decisive, that they gave them the right to political coding with the same balance in matters of state coupling.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not lasted long --</seg>
<seg id="936">As a candle, which lights very bright, it is also fast expelled.</seg>
<seg id="937">"" "" "" "however, our liberal democracy have not made their roots in the ancient Athens," ""</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy has concentrated on the free citizens, and the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for ruling.</seg>
<seg id="940">"" "" "" "for liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible, and the democratic process is limited to politics, while the economy -- is the world of corporations -- a democraticism zone." ""</seg>
<seg id="941">In our modern democracies, the separation of politics and economics began, a relentless struggle between the two instead of putting the economy into politics and escaped them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why politicians are no longer as they used to?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not up to the degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because one can be in the government nowadays and not in power, because the power of politics is wandered into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hastating with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is in about such a flock of prey, which is as sustainably the animals, of which they are nourished, decimating that they are starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy, affecting the policy so far-nibalised, that it grows due to the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of corporations grows, political goods is increasing, the economic demand falls and the managing director of corporations are too anxious to invest the cash of their business.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful of capitalism sells the "Demos" [the people] out of democracy, the higher the twin-elements, and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true it is obvious that we have to bring back the politics and the economy again, and it would be better if the "demos" keeps control so as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it didn't go along well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The teaching of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor is only to regain a position like in the ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to manage the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by doing Niedriglohnening through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, so long economy and politics are separate areas, the automation process is higher, the waste, and social conflicts are deeper, as it is -- already very soon as I think -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "" "" "so we need to reorganise the economy and re-unite the economies of the economy and politics, and in doing so that we are democratic in a disease-based surveillance hyperautocracy that lets the film" "" "matrix" "" "like a documentary." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements that he has brought forth, will survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is dissolved through a Dystopy, similar to the "matrix," in which machines serve man and people stuck up their energy into the exploration of the universe, or into a high-tech version of ancient Athenians, in long talks to the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">What does it mean, how could it look, these "Star Trek" -like utopia rather than the "matrix" -like Dystopy?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation I would like to give you some examples shortly.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of companies, please ask a capital market where you earned money, while you work and in which your capital will help you from a job to the next, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those who work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then, all income derives from capital and from dissolve and the concept of wage labor is completely outdated.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the companies, but do not work in it, and employees working there where the company doesn't belong. no bargain between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and hair, and ultimately no contemporating twins.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please just imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "Cosmos" -- and every government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or the commercial distribution of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">"" "" "" "also imagine that this fund is invested in" "" "green" "" "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment means are rare." ""</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time one had not had the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"" "" "" "today we have it, particularly against the background of a reunited politics and economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is at the same time liberary, in which it privileged people preferred, and Marxist, because they buried the separation of capital and labour in the dustbin of history, and keynesian, global keynesiology.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we watch in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar cyst scopy?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we work together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You are describing your biography in your biography than libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for reunification of politics and business is... do not do this, technological development will produce a massive decline in the economic demand, which represents Larry Summers as a 'long term stagnation. "</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from a part of Earth to the next one we're currently experiencing, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interests in liberal democracy is minor.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is correct, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">So as Hayek, so I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am also completely filtered.</seg>

BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers, you have said very clearly what you think about the view of the West in China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the semblance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics during the area where most of the world plays, -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone in the area.</seg>
<seg id="994">In some ways, if I may say that provocative may, China today resemble the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">"" "" "" "for -- we remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is an error, historically considered." ""</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">It was particularly skeptical, affecting the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can be observed now in China is very similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now propose to do what the West has done in the 19th century, rieve to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners are inquisitive about your experiences as a finance minister in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I know that this comes.</seg>

<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to start with the eurozone a new beginning,</seg>

<seg id="1011">If you are trying to preserve a business that is not viable, by political will and authoritarianism in life, you might be able to delay it perhaps a while, but when the change occurs, it happens to the core and destructive.</seg>

<seg id="1038">By Roy Price, most of which have never heard, although he is probably responsible for 22 midful minutes of your life on April 19th 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">It goes back to the decision which he met Roy three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a leitant at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has a Igelfrisur and describes himself on Twitter as "movies, TV, technology, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the show and the content out of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-war industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy can not select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows, which are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are right on the right of this turn.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the assessment distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are received this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is evaluated with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "these are shows like" Breaking Bad "" "" Game of Thrones, "" "" The Wire "--" "" The Wire "" "" -- all the shows, which addictive, your brain asks, "" "" where are there more of these episodes? "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, are shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- which should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not take care of at the left side of the curve, for I think you are already taking special intelligence to provide "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the average extermination, the average television -- the shows which are neither good nor bad, they do not amaze it.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is available, and of course it is also the first time Amazon makes something, that's why Roy Price does not risk.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to make success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a contest.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where they can look at any cost.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon otherwise are out of stuff, one can still hold right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know that they are observed in the look of these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who take all of them.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when to start the show when you're pauses, which parts you can jump and watch again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process these and from it the answer and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom over four Republican US senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">You made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many of these show can remember, because it was not so good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average-show -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of this curve gets 7,4 and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- therefore something above average, but not exactly what was going on for Roy and his team.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About at the same time at another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always searching for this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a contest, he and his team got the available data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give the shows, their course, which shows them like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these small details about the audience: which shows them like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had together all the parts, they entered a wagon and decided not to make a Sitcom over four Senators, but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"" "yes," "" "House of Cards" "". "Netflix thus has got a hit, at least for the first two seasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1079">"" "" "" "house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this corner. so exactly where they wanted to go. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course is the question: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very knowledgeable, data versed firms.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow reports that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collects millions of data for a decision you meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">One has 200 years on statistics as Back-Up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You are optimized using very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The mindeste, what you can expect is good television, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">When data analysis does not work, then this is something frightening because we live in a time when we are able to grasp more and more to collect serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company multi-health system?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come in touch with this software. come in touch with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison in the United States and ask for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is done or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it's decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, which can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results generated. this does not mean that a company like multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data dealest companies are sometimes false.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes mistakes sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that they are able to predicate through data analytics for flu, predictions, predictions -- by Data Analysis of Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully well and was a great message sensation. the success was culmined in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked impeccable, year round year to year, until it suddenly doesn't work out,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply doesn't work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data dealest companies such as Amazon and Google misunderstand sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors differs data in decisions of life - at work, in law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather ensure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-based genetics -- a territory where some very clever people use unimaginable amount of data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years I have recognised some samples over the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Have you ever need to solve a complex problem, just do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">To create this problem in its parts, so that you can analyze the parts; as a world-wide, you set up the items together to absorb a resolution.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: to take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help create a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to compose the parts and then come to a resolution.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all possess it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces to compose again, even if the information is incomplete, so when the brain is an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think, Netflix was so successful because they used data and mind, where they also go in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, why they otherwise would not have been able to put together, but the decision on how to put all these parts, bringing together a show like "House of Cards" which was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon on the other hand did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all of their decisions, first as they who had a TV-ideas, then chosen as the "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "we say the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong, when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are only one tool and in order to not forget it, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before it gave data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it is amazing. for decisions using a Jaap or no question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will leave it later with a technology demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I met some decisions in my life so far, whereby I should have heard the ball in retrospect.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you can, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it through something much more exact, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the land structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it is up to us to make choices when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data still pays off, decision making, an expert in what you do, and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">For in the end, it is not the data but the risks that you end up at the right end of the turn.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
