Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards which make your view of the city
one Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt where you can meet young people today .
a pit @-@ kap@@ elle , where now is du@@ g for the S @-@ Bahn @-@ Tunnel .
small gar@@ dener manage the one @-@ old reason of farmers .
the oldest official card coin rolls exciting stories to days .
it is annoying if land@@ karten is not up @-@ to @-@ date .
this knows each one who had already had an exciting time because the car @-@ Nav@@ i took place instead of a green meadow .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als in Bavaria of the state government , are anything but current - but therefore very reve@@ aling .
especially when you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the spread @-@ area of the Mün@@ chner Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a Flick@@ r man , which one does not recognize as such .
in the great clarity card , for towns and municipalities were more detailed maps , so called premiere .
these emerged according to the Bay@@ er@@ isches Ver@@ mess@@ ungs@@ verwaltung between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and origin@@ ate from the First Ver@@ messung .
your Client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second State of War with Austria .
Napoleon had an overview of the occupied land and gave an to@@ po@@ graphical survey of Bavaria - naturally for military purposes .
even if French troops moved to the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville , from 9 February 18@@ 01 , it was our neighbours that created the idea of a surface area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max . Joseph drove further into the project , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to@@ po@@ graphic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ mess@@ ungs@@ administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the book proposition for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all the others to find the Bay@@ er@@ isches Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison morning / Today is most impressive at the example of the country capital .
the city expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example of this is sub@@ sub@@ mitting that appears relatively isolated in the map from 18@@ 56 .
Send@@ ling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map , thus 1877 , as Mün@@ chner district .
today , sub@@ missions lies in the middle of the city .
the houses sub@@ stit@@ ches focus on 18@@ 56 along the current Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the insur@@ rection of the Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing as fields - at first glance : at the Hin@@ ter anlage , appears a small @-@ piece card with do@@ zens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written number@@ ed Fl@@ ur@@ pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ eup . &quot; from which the property tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots show there today no farmers - but small gar@@ dener in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; country in the sun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is characterised by the north of sub@@ missions .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 show@@ room of the October , was in the 19th century a meadow , and no concrete .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of the psychi@@ atric medicine .
in the judgment of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only reads the street name &quot; at Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the peak &quot; On the ventilation &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , here at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you once more people with ins@@ cription . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Mün@@ chner district @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; was created .
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who is in connection with the death of King Ludwi@@ gs II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended for example the shar@@ eholder of so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he is forbidden to apply violence against the passengers , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition of Anst@@ alt .
for 280 patients had been first place , later on 500 places has been extended .
at some point , this capacity is no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreis@@ ear@@ nest in hair 1905 .
there since 2006 the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s biggest psychiat@@ rists in Germany .
young people at the area of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt will now meet young people in the Mün@@ chner Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order @-@ war@@ b the building complex 1920 and turned him into a youth @-@ home with training occup@@ ying .
west is located in the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 one organised the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; - in architectural ten@@ dence at the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt founded during the Second World War in bom@@ bing ra@@ ids .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Marien@@ platz was named after 18@@ 56 as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the department of department was named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies in December 1944 many holes in the city centre .
one big remained until today - at the Marien@@ hof .
the German Institute , small business houses and a re @-@ kap@@ elle from the Middle Ages was once at Marien@@ hof , where these days will work the pre @-@ work and take place on 5th April 2017 of the Sp@@ at@@ enst@@ ich for the second S @-@ Bahn line .
with the slide bar , the old Munich map can be compared with the air@@ picture of today - and the hole in the Marien@@ hof will be filled .
Citi@@ zenship @-@ group released travel warning for Miss@@ ouri
the National Association for the promotion of colored people issued a warning for a colored people who travel to Miss@@ ouri due to discrimin@@ atory policies and the rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Miss@@ ouri , which will come into force by the state until 28 August 2017 , since traveling through the state requires special attention , as a number of question@@ able , bre@@ d @-@ based inci@@ dents occur recently in the entire state and stated here &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is stated in the opinion of the group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently adopted law of Miss@@ ouri , which makes it difficult to win discrimination against discrimination , as well as the enforcement authorities of the state , the dispro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate on minorities , promp@@ ters the group to release the group , told the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; they have violations of civil rights , which people happen .
they are raised because of their skin colour , they are gathered or killed , &quot; the president of Miss@@ ouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such an frequency that we have not heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by organising the organisation for a state in the United States .
the group cited inci@@ dents like rac@@ ist promises against black students at the University of Miss@@ ouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no gas@@ oline during the journey and taken away by the police of Miss@@ ouri in cust@@ ody without a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council also points to a recent report by the Council of the general state @-@ old of Miss@@ ouri , in which the black car drivers in the state 75 percent are more common than women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what might happen to Miss@@ ouri , &quot; said Chapel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be ready to bring us money or know their relatives that they are travelling through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miss@@ ouri is recorded in 2015 100 Hass@@ en@@ closure , according to the latest figures from the Hass@@ ver@@ bre@@ chens to the F@@ BI , which entered the state in terms of the number of such injury to the 16th rank of the country .
the trip warning is also an answer to a new Miss@@ ouri law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company because of housing or employment discrimination .
previously the American Civil liberties Union ( AC@@ LU ) travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona , after the states adopted immigration authorities to conce@@ al local law enforcement authorities , which will contribute to further seg@@ reg@@ ation according to the AC@@ LU on further seg@@ reg@@ ation .
tour operators are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but in recent times , stakeholders have implemented the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
Wei@@ dez@@ aun@@ project is elem@@ ental
the fisher@@ man &apos;s ordination project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U @-@ Bundest@@ ag@@ sab@@ ordin@@ ate Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ovac have created an image on site .
at the Recht@@ sh@@ enhof the family Schwen@@ de@@ mann met representatives of the fisher@@ man CD@@ U village , together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially gave insights into his farm , in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest cultivated , 40 cows , and as many young animals looked after and housed in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ es .
the &quot; Black @-@ forces &quot; is for him the altern@@ ate mark@@ eter away for the milk of his cattle , so Til@@ de@@ mann .
at the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ste comes exclusively regional .
as he is also the Chairman of the fisher@@ man , he signed the past@@ ure project as a &quot; elementary &quot; . &quot;
I can not manage in such a steep areas in a profitable way .
the green area is a lot of work , much of which can be processed using the motor sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have here with the conditions and with the to@@ po@@ graphy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the el@@ ter@@ ous operation and operated this without chemical plant protection and fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers , even if he does not lead to bio@@ production .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Comm@@ une has recognised the importance of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ordination project &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers have to be supported by the costs of 3000 to 4000 Euros per h@@ ect@@ are .
we hope that the performance of the areas could be drawn up even quite a while ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest treasure that we have are people who work in agriculture and make thought of how they continue to bring their operation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often standing in criticism of funding
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the maintenance surface is that 40 hectares , which can not be in@@ for@@ ted until at least 20@@ 23 .
the total cost of 71 500 Euro was funded half of the Group , a quarter carried the municipality of Fis@@ bach .
thus we also love the farmers 12 610 euros they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of course .
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ovac stressed : &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and land@@ cla@@ ws do not go . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter Weiss stood firm : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here are the best food produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Land@@ s@@ accountable Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg offers the government promotion of en@@ closures .
the goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest .
the presence of one of the L@@ PR was marked by the L@@ PR .
furthermore , the en@@ closure area may not be semi @-@ commercial ( Hang@@ ing over 35 per cent ) and must therefore be threatened by re@@ fo@@ rest@@ ation .
for the fisher@@ man Wei@@ dez@@ aun@@ projekt 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots that want to build about 16 kilometres .
the maintenance surface equivalent to 35 hectares , the cost @-@ calculated cost is more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime transition is it when they begin to att@@ ing statues instead .
the Americans appreciate this just like any other - hence the cau@@ ti@@ fied overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ os Place in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key @-@ ide@@ ologists of the tr@@ ump regime , certainly did what he did when he was a symbolic key with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N about the proposals of the President to the dra@@ stic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller reached not the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of jet@@ ties and Liberty Im@@ it@@ ators would have fought him if he had done it .
but he laid their significance , and in particular the meaning that it was written , when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
as Miller A@@ co@@ sta , &quot; I want to go here not on a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom , which illumin@@ ated the world .
the poem on which you relate it was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is proper right , but how he formulated it itself , it is not really about history .
it is about the contemporary reson@@ ance on the asc@@ ending words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; your ef@@ fort@@ less , your arms , / your be@@ ating masses , who after that longing , free to breathe , / the el@@ astic waste of your wealthy shores . &quot;
there never was a time when the &quot; el@@ end Ab@@ fall &quot; was better to see on our scre@@ ens .
Miller got involved in liter@@ ary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps USA .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict : it is indeed a conflict about the meaning of America .
Laz@@ arus - and their friends who sat down to place their words after their death on the basis - did very good that they did a high political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ anism , showing the feminine portra@@ ying of the feminine em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice .
and she gives himself an entirely different name : mother of ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist Cou@@ p and an devast@@ ating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just like Laz@@ arus the significance of the statue changed , the people from the right wing didn &apos;t want to change this long time .
the great cry of R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of Johannes of the Bu@@ yer for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was no one , but rather an early ne@@ oc@@ on @-@ conservative man , who is the American flame into the around the world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
she is supposed to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch is not supposed to enligh@@ ten the way into the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ construc@@ gh here on something .
the significance of the statue is quite and certainly a matter of point of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they seen from the exhau@@ stive , mis@@ erable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible trips on the Dec@@ ks of ships .
it &apos;s going to be in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refu@@ ge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
and of course this is not the perspective that you want to recognize Miller and Tr@@ ump .
their tor@@ ch should not experience the path , but the hat@@ red , who is their only source of power , ign@@ iting .
world Championships 2017 : Neil Black lo@@ bt Scottish members of the team of Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two vill@@ i belonging to the team of Great Britain
the performance dire@@ ktor of the UK &apos;s Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ sham@@ anic controversi@@ es can make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 which starts on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland has developed some special things &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the UK must learn something of it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand and we will continue to see it , until we find it &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the corner corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals @-@ candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m circuit , while E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle was elected to the team member .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ dh is quite modest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your captain &apos;s speech was amazing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or where they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
the passion and the genuine feel that E@@ ili@@ ie took quite naturally , were great . &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth of Silver Medal , which is in its fifth world cup , with the 400 @-@ m hur@@ dles , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 vill@@ i are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total amount of athletes during the World Cup was seven , which was reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ distance Mu@@ ir runs past five British and two European records last year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m runs , another Scot@@ sman , which one is looking for a great season that included the victory in the British team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
he re@@ members their first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell was .
the Mann@@ ist chapters say that they are &quot; immense &quot; to the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots do not only belong to the team , but in some cases are also among the medals and among the Fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing to be this team is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour , but knowing that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chose to have something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the vill@@ i who belong to the team .
it shows only how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes , who want to ascend on po@@ ds .
what my talk as captain concerns ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that in this situation we are very happy as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on this visit@@ ation and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it &apos;s just being a great atmosphere there . &quot;
block all critics about Facebook : don &apos;t ask you for a public position if you cannot toler@@ ate the inser@@ ts of voters
the father of our land knew some of the bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers bore him for everything , from the internal policy up to his political principles .
he sha@@ ved in criticism , safe .
but he has not brought his critics into silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and wor@@ dless , we shall be led as the sheep to the battles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Maryland govern@@ or Lar@@ ry Hog@@ an who must work on it , more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on its official Facebook page .
and the American Civil War Union def@@ endant him therefore at the beginning of this week .
the rod of the govern@@ or dism@@ issed the law@@ suit as fri@@ v@@ ol , and the online comment was full of a bac@@ kl@@ ash with &quot; Na , and ? &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important if there is a type like Hog@@ an .
this is a Republi@@ can govern@@ or in an overwhelming democratic state which is amazing .
he has the second highest authority of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Hog@@ an is not a reactionary H@@ itz@@ head .
he has shown a strong hand in the guidance of his state and strict compliance with principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ fully to use Facebook as primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his ha@@ iry head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore the block@@ ade of people who come to the side of the Gover@@ nor - which is a public forum that is officially called by public tax currency - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post office in Amelia Ch@@ asse @-@ Spre@@ cher@@ in Amelia Ch@@ asse the actions of the govern@@ or and argu@@ ed that the block@@ ade of the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too simple to use the image by TRO@@ LL@@ EN or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ opping Points , who vibr@@ ate online the wh@@ ip .
the post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hog@@ an .
and these are only real people who speak with their chosen guides , a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , does not lead a role .
they all said that their comments are respectful , thought@@ ful and not prof@@ ited .
the pastor cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to the Apostolic faith .
attorney , Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , MD . , was not filled , but she asked to hate Hass@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I found polit@@ ely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other recent news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote them in the commentary box of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people take place on the same subject , they are mis@@ understood by some rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what the employees of the govern@@ ors were as a &quot; concentrated Spam @-@ attack , &quot; others would probably call &apos; inter@@ c@@ ation &apos; .
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply gets a cr@@ itic or deleted a negative comment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a lot of cleaner than in former times when people have done the same to collect newspapers with critical leadership patterns and to burn or bol@@ ted demonstr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that is exactly what is happening on digital .
Hog@@ an is not the first public official that is critic@@ ised to that he imp@@ lied Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is bor@@ der@@ ings by Twitter @-@ users who were blocked by his Twitter fe@@ eds .
one of the first mil@@ estones were last week in Virginia .
the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County last the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. bor@@ der@@ ters James C. Cach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when she called a vot@@ al voters from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Be@@ vin ( R ) received a visit from the AC@@ LU due to its use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so hard .
at the moment Washington &apos;s time had a similar effect on the Internet at affordable Por@@ tos .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter envel@@ opes to his leadership .
and even at that time Washington had an anonymous sp@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who use pseud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ju@@ ri@@ cola &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; all letters at newspapers that made Washington decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pet@@ itions that have critic@@ ized his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , Trade and Navigation of Great Britain , according to the historical documents produced by the George Washington Project by the Online Pap@@ ers .
but he has not brought them to silence .
speech , speech and dis@@ courses are part of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home and comfort at the Renaissance Club
the former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days at home comforts as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .

&quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he achieved fame with this event , &quot; said Cris@@ er@@ ty .
&quot; the players will see this course from his best page , he is in a great place .
Jerry made a great job when he placed this place .
he is an eager supporters of this game and is proud of his performance here .

the Engl@@ ish@@ man is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he won the European Tour in his 32 @-@ year career as well as the European Challenge tour .
&quot; it really feels great , &quot; said in South@@ port heated players .
&quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open as it was in the year after I won it from the program was taken .
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here to win .
it was a really special time and one we always appreciated . &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year , return to the action on the ground floor .
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ de@@ en Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh Friday .
&quot; you want to do it well , but you feel also this additional pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid player .
I am glad how we have gone . &quot;

over the past two decades fewer people died of lung cancer in the past two decades .
for this result , scientists have come to Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after our estimates , a year of 167 pul@@ mon@@ ary waste is attri@@ but@@ able to passi@@ v@@ rau@@ lt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Study managers Heiko Mu@@ eller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he set up an own study on this subject from 1994 .
at that time there were still 400 pul@@ mon@@ ary har@@ b@@ ins because of passi@@ v@@ rau@@ bling per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house @-@ caps prove to be very complex
construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and lie somewhat in time , &quot; thus the head of the building Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of house@@ closures , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as in the underground much wi@@ ches , which is not remembered in the plans .
the traffic , which always ham@@ pered the construction works , represents a major problem for the construction of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignor@@ ance of the drivers in front of red traffic and lock@@ out is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is locked and only the regular buses be eligible for passage .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p has been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were very busy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but luckily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cooler mineral water , &quot; tells Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i cook@@ s dinner , she uses no stove .
it even rarely use a pot .
in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ele in the un@@ quiet Indon@@ esian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; Not@@ a , &quot; right in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the conden@@ sed k@@ ool is taken with free@@ zing , un@@ washed hands and dev@@ oured them .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the loft - it has no furniture - where she also performs its daily work , for example d@@ resses with d@@ ressed water from the nearby S@@ umpf .
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ ine .
as the youngest of the four wives , their hus@@ bands were assigned to their fields .
poly@@ gam@@ ie is common here .
of course , late to work too dangerous : most men men are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there is the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody w@@ ills , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders should vote in front of the occupation forces before the occupation forces .
an existing movement which touched by the independence against the Dutch rule turned rapidly against the government of Jak@@ arta who enter@@ tains in control of the region and includes foreign journalists or legal observer .
in 2003 the province became officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea &apos;s eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is desert . the journey includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning @-@ hour drive with the car .
there are no public transport .
the city with about 19,@@ 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bam@@ boo and surrounded by cor@@ rug@@ ated roofs , which were converted by r@@ ust in different yellow be@@ atings .
only very few Indon@@ esian made their journey here , refused for journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , schol@@ ars mee P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans a God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to their lively , handmade tur@@ ban , her dar@@ ica shirt and their bright rock .
&quot; previous we only had leaves to our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indon@@ esian province , where 28 % of men live under the poverty line and some of the worst inf@@ ant mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indon@@ esian gold .
the largest and profitable gold mine of the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , lies only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land provincial in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3.000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort made the value of 3,@@ 1 billion US dollars of gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wood resources valued at 78 billion US dollars .
however , these ri@@ ches are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua that ensure Indon@@ esian military is a former military presence preserved .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort local military battles and units between 1998 and 2004 paid nearly 20 million US dollars , among them up to 15@@ 0,000 US dollars at a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ an claims after a greater autonomy thre@@ aten this Golden G@@ ans and become gr@@ ass@@ ed .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed since 1969 by the Indon@@ esian military , tor@@ tured and det@@ ained .
mass@@ ages in Pap@@ u@@ as tri@@ es@@ state in the 1970 @-@ Pacific Group have been conducted in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission on genocide .
in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police in the past year more than 3.@@ 900 peaceful protest@@ ers .
&quot; we called &quot; Every@@ thing &quot; is stated in a report of the arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e from the year 2016 , in which reports of atro@@ cities and torture - rape and electrical attacks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as each week will happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have intensified , because Pap@@ u@@ as resources have an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development changes itself , because Muslim economic migrants are coming from the populated islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ning @-@ Kant@@ inen sell ast@@ at@@ enes chicken and gado @-@ gado , a mixed vegetables with Erd@@ n@@ uss@@ el served .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has the native pap@@ ua - the mom @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; from Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indon@@ esian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , known in folk and as Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke during his election campaign to address the ine@@ qualities and the infrin@@ gements in Pap@@ ua .
the former car@@ p@@ enter 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Presi@@ dential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have been voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with anticip@@ ation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai was only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is In@@ au@@ gur@@ ation in October a deep @-@ point .
on December 7 , 2014 was a group of 11 children outside and sang Christ@@ mas@@ k@@ songs in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , as two Indon@@ esian soldiers on a motorcycle by the darkness .
the scar@@ ed children spoke to them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took us off the tone and came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers , who had dr@@ unk , hunt and sm@@ ote the group with their v@@ ant@@ ons , they said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers over@@ turned into the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , has been so hard be@@ aten that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building was set by the nearby Government Commission and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
approximately 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves to a football field in front of the local police station and the military komm@@ and@@ o@@ zentrum to ask justice .
they bore sh@@ red hunting s@@ hab@@ by and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle continuously and a bird @-@ s@@ im@@ iti@@ ate - from Pap@@ u@@ as army P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some protest@@ ers began je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ate stones on police and military forces .
when the atmosphere was heated , the soldier was sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it is stated in an official document of TIME that has not been released by local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ Quarter @-@ Quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ w@@ ning danger and called for peace and called the amount to return home .
no one was to listen to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , suddenly I turned into my lin@@ kes wr@@ ist , &quot; he said TIME on the porch of his coloured wooden house .
kay@@ ame still does not know who has folded , but says that the bul@@ let come from the ranks of the gathered soldiers gathered .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots have been fi@@ red , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ous@@ in , the witness of shooting was .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and sear@@ ched his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ esian only one name , the TIME in dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I k@@ issed him . &quot;
the che@@ ating spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Rep@@ or@@ ters , that his officers &quot; wanted to only secure their station &quot; because they are attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others have been inju@@ red .
the news about the k@@ ill@@ ings came only on the following day &apos; filmed &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks attended Jok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura held a passionate talk to address the sympath@@ ies for families of victims and schw@@ or to address the historical de@@ cks in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case be resolved right away , so that in future it will no longer happen in future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he proposed an extra@@ judicial mechanism for maintaining historical human rights violations .
but the talk began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 ′ s and early 2000 @-@ he years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that must go through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then , the ac@@ err@@ ada made a retreat when he spoke on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with TIME and said , he did not have any plans , in Pap@@ ua a complaint mechanism .
instead , &quot; everything is regulated by law &quot; he said .
the Wir@@ ac@@ err@@ ada , indic@@ ted the UN for crimes against humanity , called for more than 1,000 deaths in East tim@@ ors of bloody independence in the East of 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua were already attached , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims with gri@@ ps un@@ believers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear .
&quot; I fear , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , are afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was be@@ aten from the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I buried the cor@@ pse , the military sought after me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
while a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to bring an un@@ conscious man into the hospital , died a person and 17 others were wo@@ unded , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dro@@ w@@ ned when he caught in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
harvest@@ ed vill@@ agers protest@@ ed in front of the location office of the company .
the police said that the vill@@ agers were mur@@ dered by officers , who re@@ acted upon it when waiting for war@@ ts .
but locals say that the mobile brig@@ ade began to shoot ( Indon@@ esian par@@ am@@ il@@ itary police ) on the crowd and a mort@@ ar .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that it will be reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu Badi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witness as the wo@@ unded here were delivered quickly so the TIME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve hidden me two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called to hold the officers into account and withdraw the mobile brig@@ ade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a glorious government for the Indon@@ esian government .
the lack of sen@@ ti@@ ous development strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tribe of the people , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many adh@@ ered to the &quot; free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army , that claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by h@@ itting the rights of the Pap@@ ua by tac@@ kl@@ ed attacks and kid@@ n@@ apping of Indon@@ esian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to recent years thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years , under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Security of national sovereignty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some will never dive again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai as &quot; a tragic , wast@@ ed place &quot; known .
poverty strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the bit of rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just the same as a range .
the people here are building everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruits and leaf .
agriculture is the task of women to work with four or five fields of Sweet potato .
they keep the bulk of harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a tasted only 10,000 Indon@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire airport in larger numbers .
the few jobs there are in the region , usually go to the better trained and aff@@ lu@@ ent migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own companies competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for here there are no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the tribe of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isol@@ ating the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions to the reporting of international media remains ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , the French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported to lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to the films .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Dep@@ uty Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is elec@@ toral campaign , the limitations of reporting , in order to raise transparency and development , not realized .
&quot; there are new threats to foreign journalists who try to try to report Indon@@ esian un@@ ro@@ ast@@ ern@@ most provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa @-@ denial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation .
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government remains largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March six paci@@ f@@ fish countries - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ za , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ in@@ seln and the Sal@@ om@@ onen @-@ Inseln - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically been supported the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indon@@ esian Department of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r pointed to the pro@@ aches of the Group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights violations . &quot;
local governments want to take note of more foreign governments .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right @-@ amb@@ assador K@@ ees Van B@@ aar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also took part in meeting , but remain anonymous .
Indonesia also has another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua say that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the tribe .
he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai nation knows that it is living under the constant threat of a military military living in arm@@ ouring and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , think their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; that he has to pay back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ation led families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ offering a final symbolic act of the d@@ ope : the cor@@ pse of a victim was buried on a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know that they might never send justice to justice , but at least they will not forget their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with the head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &quot; Tor@@ ch &quot; skyscr@@ apers of Dubai for the second time
a fire found on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai his play@@ book and forced hundreds of inhabitants from which 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ sto@@ rey building to escape .
it is the second fire that is swe@@ pt in just two years by the Hoch@@ haus , which one calls to the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injury were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we stayed at the fire alarm and the scre@@ aming of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor to come down , &quot; told a residents who moved his name to George , Reu@@ ters .
Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00.00 am GMT ) the fire cle@@ ared and the building cool@@ ed .
the government said they work on the provision of accommodations for those affected .
the incident can be questions about the safety of materials that are used in areas of high @-@ houses around the world .
an investigation by the management of the tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the biggest part of the damage caused by the clothes , the outer garments that came to decoration or insulation .
in Britain , the police said they believe that the system of plates to isolation and Bonn@@ et at the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a brand in which around 80 people died .
no Davis Cup @-@ Reform : ongoing Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through with his big Davis Cup cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h city meeting was supported for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup bur@@ ners only to play on two winn@@ ings , grasp @-@ thin not supported by the two @-@ third majority .
this often very long , but even therefore very valued five @-@ set @-@ classics remain the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of member states voted for reform , the goal of IT@@ F @-@ president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore , was only barely missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one will continue to work on improving the applic@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at all , not until the vote was before the proposal before , the proposal came to spread the final in a neutral place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively minor details : so the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be able to have the host right next year in the first round .
to reduce the costs of the Organ@@ izer , the requirements for training programs , etc . and players will have to complete the official media appointments before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 of 5 US travelers brings bot@@ her@@ ed items to the aircraft , finding a survey
a survey conducted by air passengers yiel@@ ded that more than 20 percent are aware or un@@ aware of the control points of U.S. transportation security administration past , including at least 6 percent that betra@@ y the aircraft , while they are acci@@ dentally written kni@@ ves or other items with blade .
fewer than 1 % claimed , they would have been del@@ ayed that they were er@@ ron@@ eous with fire@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition or explosive .
the survey with more than 1,000 people - that was conducted by a Jet charter service , the Str@@ atos Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also fixed that younger travellers must dis@@ respect the rules .
of the respon@@ dents , the donations that they have attempted to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 per cent mill@@ enni@@ als compared to less than 15 percent , members of the generation X were .
the most common items that were buried in T@@ SA agents , were food and liqui@@ ds .
more than 3 per cent under@@ went to have wis@@ ely items with blade by the safety control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3,@@ 7 per cent of male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they would have seen un@@ seen drugs into the aircraft .
the company said , it was asked travellers around the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally sm@@ ug@@ gling sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers had brought about the airport security and how many it would have done so .
it is no surprise that people who appreciate the most sm@@ ug@@ g@@ sm@@ s - kno@@ w@@ ingly or un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly - by safety carrying those who were most frequently fly .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often un@@ certain which liqui@@ ds may take them or how much of it .
so there is no surprise that the largest quantity of the T@@ SA conf@@ isc@@ ated items are bot@@ her@@ ed .
a time thought the people , the T@@ SA could see books as sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers .
liqui@@ ds are allowed on domestic flights but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is it no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la @-@ customers order
&quot; &quot; &quot; electric @-@ thous@@ and@@ assa El@@ on Mus@@ k is happy to have the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , he has signed up to now that a part of the customers have with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation already .
in addition to the continually tri@@ umph@@ ant numbers on turnover growth and still huge sales aim , Tes@@ la leader El@@ on Mus@@ k has to betra@@ y a different , less glorious count for the first time : the cancell@@ ations of the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k has often used more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new cars , whose delivery just starts .
now , Mus@@ k had : from the total of 5@@ 18,@@ 000 reservations , 6@@ 3,000 has already been with@@ drawn .
critics always pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservation .
for a cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euros ( in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; completely back .
currently , 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservation prior to , räum@@ te mus@@ k at a telephone conference with analy@@ st .
that the cancellation of up to date about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem , the Tes@@ la Chef does not believe .
its argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
in the last year Tes@@ la has supplied Tes@@ la 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
by 2018 - all models are coming together - 500@@ ,000 to 2020 , 2020 one million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , at present every day 1800 reservations are made .
who@@ ever orders a &quot; Model 3 , &quot; must be expected in the second half of 2018 with the delivery - if Tes@@ la creates it , its brand new , still never in the practice of tested manufacturing roads without larger inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum utili@@ zation .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
however , it comes to bigger delays , then the in@@ binding of reservations could become the problem for Tes@@ la .
for then , the company can not prevent un@@ satisfied customers who run away in Sch@@ aren .
EPA @-@ Chef P@@ ru@@ itt moves to cut down the rules of the Obama @-@ Era to reduce emissions

P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change as his agency pointed to the needs of state environmental authorities towards re@@ acting quicker than previous wo@@ unds .
he did not mention the law@@ suit against his previous position in a federal trial court .

last month , a federal decision in Washington has decided that the EPA has passed its authority than he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies for monitoring and reducing meth@@ an@@ le@@ cks .
in a on Wednesday evening review , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his turn@@ around at O@@ zone standards just simply the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states by the complex process of timely implementation of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administrative , the EPA has often sold the dead@@ lines for performing and then waiting to be charged by activ@@ ist groups and others , and reported in an agreement to set out for the implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , which hit the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we also take the law and authority that there is us , seriously . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the comments of EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; power &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority for the delay and all the other legal mechanisms to make sure that the rules &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be based on solid politics and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in the Congress are pushing for a wider re @-@ reaching new version of the O@@ zon@@ ing .
last month approved for the bill , the implementation of the rules of 2015 should be hes@@ it@@ ating for at least eight years .
the measure was not yet provided in the Senate .
the New York City @-@ General @-@ General , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who fought the United States , who had dra@@ fted the EPA in this week , said the group intend to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - after our days - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6,@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and over 115 million Americans , which are directly affected by the sm@@ og , which flows directly from the sm@@ og , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York united in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Maine , Massachusetts , Min@@ nes@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Vermont , and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil @-@ o@@ zone is created when poll@@ ut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil sophisticated , chemical products , and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .
the resulting sm@@ og can cause serious respir@@ ation problems for sensitive groups of people , and will contribute to thousands of premature deaths every year .
representatives of the public health system and the environ@@ ment@@ alists are rejo@@ ic@@ ing about P@@ ru@@ dge surprising change @-@ change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is wor@@ rying how much pressure it takes to preserve this reasonable step by those responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to continue to fight against ide@@ ological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government , cont@@ acting on environmental norms and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Verein wants to check permission of Wind@@ bikes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ eds itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see legal conditions for construction and therefore turned to the coun@@ cils . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw its approval for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the club argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette could not have been approved at all , because at the time in Vier@@ sen to swal@@ lows a wind force of wind force .
within this concentration of concentration , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , at the same time , the concentration of concentration , but an exclusion of wind turbines for the other city area .
such zones should prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
a few days earlier had decided by amending the surface cleaner , a second wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but the district government was not approved in Düsseldorf , because of a form of format .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of budget@@ ary condition , the author@@ ization author@@ ization is to be legally law@@ ful and therefore also back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Erk@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current status of the Th@@ esis : the City Council before the summer break once again decided once again the Wind@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a permission from the District government still stands out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cold : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is therefore the issu@@ ing of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines legal &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been to the circle Vier@@ sen since past week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them to cause the matter once again .
however , they probably do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
with a view of the current proceedings at the Board of Directors , the circle on Thursday did not want to express themselves in content with the arg@@ umentation of the &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; by the arg@@ umentation of the &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette building the construction of four per 200 meters high wind motorcycles .
already last year , the company had involved in which the city quad@@ ru@@ ple is medi@@ oc@@ able , excav@@ ated with the owner of about 65 hectares of great money .
with the construction of four wind turbines , the power supply needs to be covered from around 11 400 households - this is equivalent to one @-@ fifth of all four @-@ four households .
the NEW Re will invest around 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen Stad@@ tr@@ l gave green light to purchase three wind turbines in the Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind turbines in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .

trans@@ cription of phone call between U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump and guides of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on January 27th , Tr@@ ump calls for Tr@@ ump in a phone with the Mexican President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to to say , publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. President accused him because he had said the wall openly . he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can not tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump began its presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the US , and sw@@ ans to pay Mexico for the project .

Mos@@ res Ford @-@ Mass@@ acre : activists lead rac@@ ist mo@@ ist act as call for justice again
an 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury was driving through a group of spect@@ ators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and rum@@ bled to the Ford @-@ Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had reached , the bridge could reach , a group of white men came out with a gun to block its path .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man of middle aged man in a needle @-@ far turn - took a long train to its cig@@ ar and inspec@@ ted by the wind@@ shield .
inside , the in@@ mates shr@@ ines in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wr@@ apped the guy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; let him out of the car ! &quot;
Schre@@ ie sm@@ ris@@ se die Stille , regarded as a young black man from the passenger seat was dist@@ orted .
fortunately this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , only one post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; put almost all in the audience very real epide@@ m@@ zer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 civil law on Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge return to im@@ itate the night , in the two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
nobody was ever charged on account of murder .
&quot; it is truly un@@ treat@@ able that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see it in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , which helps in organizing the post office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt native to a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old member of the State of Georgia and a life of civil rights .
it serves as a dramatic call for action as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that no in@@ justice has never been corrected .
&quot; we want enforcement , we want to end , we want healing , we want healing , but first we need to preserve justice , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation , until we get justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a mis@@ medical practition@@ er lays a du@@ el over the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on 27 July 1946 .
according to F@@ BI files , which were obtained from the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding areas were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but none has ever been charged .
although the susp@@ ects have been on free foot for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions around the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , allowed a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice to the black citizens in Georgia , it was the first time to vote their voice in the summer .
about the same time as the choice st@@ ach to the F@@ BI of black Far@@ mp@@ lets Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , whereas a fight down - supp@@ os@@ edly because of a woman .
Bro@@ oks said the rum@@ or in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy and that the baby , which she carried , not by her husband .
on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
but when they removed himself from the prison and surrender to the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b moved the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who has prepared and arranged the murder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; closes a F@@ BI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a holistic agreement between the state and local law enforcement , which was not only involved in the murder , evidence and understood the identity of witnesses &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks formulated it even more striking .
&quot; it was an election @-@ called mass@@ acre , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register , and if you vote , then this will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nearly a decade ago Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual im@@ position of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is des@@ crip@@ tive , grasp and is due in a kind of deep racism , many of whom would like to believe that it does not exist in America anymore .
it is difficult to look at , and even harder to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not want to talk about Lyn@@ chen , because we are confronted with his ugly face in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build any relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or want to hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen woman and the rest bl@@ acks - into a room and lou@@ dly , as a Gre@@ ene took a well @-@ made overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of chief of the head @-@ member since years , but he said , the role will never become easier .
&quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to get this story at life because we do not want to return to those times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the hat@@ ch and pus@@ hes him to angry us with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , lost my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona depic@@ ted the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone is breaking ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene lau@@ gh at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still k@@ ick@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think that white people were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n --- &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; swe@@ ating one of the other black performers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you just need to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and just as shi@@ fts the energy in the space , a sense of camera , replaces the discomfort .
everybody is busy to get this correctly , not just because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one lau@@ gh .
this repet@@ ition ends violent and fast .
there is hor@@ semen , shots and then silence .
a woman , be@@ amed with a trau@@ ma gar@@ ment , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads tr@@ endor@@ se True worship &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it . &quot;
your voice breaks in every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen viewers are swe@@ at and tears from sight .
the audience is almost un@@ even@@ ly divided between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come only down the road .
they have experienced nearly eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as pressing moisture when Bro@@ oks &apos;s leading them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until that point , the Mor@@ de have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when one stands on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de , the air feels sal@@ uted .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene loads the amount to get closer and to insp@@ ect the loan .
children ho@@ cken in their heads , sign the f@@ ake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing to each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ elt a little boy , as if he wants to remember it .
a few minutes thanks Gre@@ ene of the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ chs@@ eil away and wi@@ h her tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ arm@@ t Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the move , who has played the team member .
Nick Ras@@ cona um@@ im@@ pover@@ ished two of his fellow @-@ players and then cr@@ ying in her arms , cr@@ ying the emotional last of the performance finally breaks upon him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ per@@ ing one of the women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have done this for a reason . &quot;
later the audience with the actors for dinner together .
at one table ch@@ ew@@ ed a white pair of Atlanta stim@@ ulated over the post@@ ings with a black couple that they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski strug@@ gled to find words which left the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who like yourself and what they do , because they look like you , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what that really does with me lets me believe that the Lyn@@ chen is still going on , &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called by police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks keeps on his table , he is eating and reminds of citi@@ zenship .
he said he already began to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post@@ ure is inspir@@ ational , because it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have end@@ ure , but it is also a moment of learning &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is like we do nothing to learn from it , then it may happen again .
who@@ ever studies his own history , who does not know his own history is condemned to repe@@ ating them . &quot;

I prefer a positive response .
max amount works as volunteers
they work in their voluntary year at several places .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in stone @-@ belt , once a week helping me here in Gre@@ ven in the Möbel@@ brücke .
and I have already worked on the school in open day @-@ day .
what are your experiences with that ?
quantity : it is a nice , broad spectrum which I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
now they are 26 years now , so is a late volunteer .
how does that come about ?
quantity : I made a diplom@@ a .
and then a building engineer , let &apos;s say successfully ab@@ orted .
I realised for me that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else , working with people .
and then I asked what you do .
take a social year since there is an insight , you can see how it &apos;s on @-@ site , in the focal point perhaps also , really is .
and was it so ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social @-@ education during the winter semester .
I will study dual , make a social worker training and studies in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hoch@@ schule .
is it not unusual , during the volunteer opportunities to have several different areas of use ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it will probably always come to where you make his FS@@ J .
you can do it from the Alter@@ sheim to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very diversi@@ fied .
I was partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that has fu@@ cked me .
I could recognize and see my own strengths and how it really proceeds .
unlike in the building engineer ?
quantity : na clear , here it is not about to be reck@@ oned .
there is always another man &apos;s head , which each have a quite different story behind you .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been r@@ alled out of the family - you must always go to it individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations about it ?
quantity : for this I am not the guy .
there is a area that gives a lot .
lots of love , much kindness .
there are also negative moments , but so life is .
Pear@@ son re@@ acts another 3,000 jobs and cut the dividend to re @-@ revi@@ ve the business
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut off their inter@@ l@@ ending order by 72 per cent , as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the print which the company faced . &quot; &quot; &quot;

con@@ vo@@ i @-@ attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed at self @-@ murder
a self @-@ ass@@ ass@@ inated has an army con@@ voy to be attacked in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , a soldier of N@@ ato , and several other wo@@ unded , say officials .
five soldiers and a interpre@@ ters have been wo@@ unded , made a statement of N@@ ato .
un@@ confirmed local reports say according to the incident in the district of Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h also three civilians .
the bom@@ bing is the last violence of violence in Afghanistan - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday a self @-@ ass@@ ass@@ inated two people died near the Iraqi Embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in an opinion of the N@@ ato , the explosion on Thursday nights would be done as a joint pan@@ rou@@ ille with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; person of person carried out impro@@ per approach . &quot;
the statement states that all the bre@@ aches are in a stable state and be treated in the U.S. military hospital in Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , which is known as a so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h , a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , in Afghanistan the first half of 2017 there was at least 1,6@@ 62 civil death @-@ offering , about 20 % of them in the capital .
in the end of July a su@@ icide @-@ bom@@ b for at least 30 people in a mainly schi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they would have done this attack .
on May 31st he k@@ issed a huge bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city more than 150 people with the deadly milit@@ ant assault of the country , since the U.S. led troops displ@@ ac@@ ement the power .

EPA gives decision to del@@ aying the sm@@ og rule to law@@ suits .
the US American environment authority has a decision to re@@ lie@@ ve a regulation of the government of Obama , laugh@@ ing what the states are oblig@@ ated to d@@ ash@@ ore the sm@@ og @-@ caused emissions . this was a day after 15 countries def@@ ends the agency because of the step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ zon@@ ation 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said , they show the obligation of the agency to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we react to our state partners &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said EPA @-@ leader Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA in June - in which to be measured in a part of the country of poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions to set out where in@@ cis@@ ions must be taken to delay even more str@@ ingent air quality standards - in order to delay a year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , took place on Tuesday , and said that the effort was illegal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to rise up a wide range of environmental regulations , which led by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda , which is said to boost economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , efforts have triggered the decl@@ ining of Democrats and reserves , which are worried about the impact of greater emissions on public health .
the website of EPA says that the inhal@@ ing of air , the o@@ zone includes &quot; the lung function can reduce the lung function and increase the breath@@ able symptoms , &quot; as for example as@@ thma .
municipal at wants common room
in the end the decision was clear : with two counter@@ parts the com@@ der@@ at of Flu@@ orn winds , the establishment of a shared area in the future sen@@ iors .
prior to discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement signed in for the missing parts of the land was signed by Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
though , it will still last until the so far the church community belonging to the church is in common ownership , but there is now no plan for planning for that from a private investor to st@@ em@@ ing project more .
there is a discussion regarding a shared area .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat are offered to meet the church .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an all 70 square meters area for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the coun@@ cils are ho@@ oked to such a common area just not as a meeting place just for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ oren@@ ette , but open into the community .
as an example , the word made from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ ick café &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision taken by providing means for the current household has already been decided in the last autumn by funding opportunities .
the construction is located in the refurb@@ ishment area .
the establishment of a common area would be , so reports T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve .
the final decision to sign@@ alling the investor is to sign@@ post it in this respect no bil@@ let &apos;s legs , determine that both saddle - which reduces nuclear power - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - which makes the low height and the construction of economic power - is possible .
need@@ less , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this add@@ itive .
when it helps : un@@ anim@@ ously , he happens the panel .
not so easy it goes to the common area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela Ruf points to the many own buildings where you are not going to go so right now , for whom you feel right in common room with the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was hard for it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Yvonne Sta@@ iger necessarily speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it looks behind it an un@@ covered sub @-@ invention in any case , or even foreign investors .
that is not just that , because with the acquisition of the area you do not give an allowance , but get a real , dec@@ ay in doubt , is the bac@@ kl@@ ess .
state &apos;s request to feed the decisions accordingly , finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains in two counter@@ part in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller creates so together : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we take the decision , we take a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

this was not least good . &quot;
however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season .

in the har@@ z from Stern to Stern
in the Har@@ z , the nation &apos;s largest &quot; star path &quot; is supposed to arise .
this is planning the association astronom@@ ical Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the information needs to be viewed from many other visitors , it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connecting nature , science , movement and sport@@ y performance .
the members want to put up along the planned route and inform about stars and star pictures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the first phase to 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well achiev@@ able installations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in@@ frage im frage im St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß und Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards should be comple@@ mented by the Internet .
therefore , in the selection , a good mobile net @-@ reception plays a role .
also Acc@@ essi@@ bility is one crit@@ erion .
later , the con@@ stellation train will be extended by train .
&quot; on the star path the viewers will experience a lot of knowledge , such as the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association .
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star grew stronger than another , although he is much farther away .
also , in which con@@ stellation can be given a chosen star and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating at the Berg@@ städ@@ ter St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , which is the highest located star observ@@ atory north Germany .
the location in the middle of the National Park of Har@@ z is according to details of the Federal Minister for Natural Protection to the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
frequently they are from the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a @-@ galaxy with naked eye clearly visible .
in the university city there has been an initiative of the Förder@@ verein planet@@ arium , somewhat similar to the planned star@@ fish - Plan@@ eten@@ weg .
starting before Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary trail leads up to the Hain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( Munici@@ p@@ ality ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the ri@@ mp with the individual planets - including des to the Zwer@@ g@@ ej@@ eten de@@ gra@@ di@@ fied Plu@@ to at the end point - are precisely placed at a distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inking so on a ball of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , whereas the exact 75 meters from the sun is about 70 centi@@ meters .
the total distance of the planet is a good four kilometers .
while the light is needed from sun to Plu@@ to , about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are thus faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fixed star but would last even a last year .

&quot; I am a former spring , &quot; reminded Gar@@ cia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have risen to Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to get down on a light weight .

let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko tun@@ ed .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this struggle could take place in the Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all fans asked for him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and strongly open to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said , he value Lom@@ ach@@ enko , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous figh@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he may possibly take part in his Saturday battle . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gar@@ cia said that focus is , percussion to show , then boxes .
both told , they could feel the momentum , that arose for their own battle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no other fight so much attention and enthusiasm .
I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have wa@@ ited for the top @-@ fighters and that is Mik@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great battle . &quot;

Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; Triple chain works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann Gu@@ ests after 2 : 2 for the season over@@ clo@@ es against Braunschweig , that the optimization of the inter@@ connections in Au@@ e points will bring .
with the first season , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , would not be the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much and we have to adapt to Au@@ e even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defen@@ cel@@ ess of Fortuna Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge the three @-@ chain is also further optim@@ ised .
and a gate after an open , the Fort@@ ress will no longer want to be influenced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be like no more next to Michael ( R@@ ensing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better to cope with the experience in preparation with the three @-@ dimensional chain as well as with the four @-@ legged chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is confident of his thing , &quot; because we have just in the three @-@ positions on the half @-@ positions in KA@@ AN Ay@@ han and N@@ iko found@@ elmann players who can build well &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the requirement is that we are even better harmon@@ ieren and we do not make so much confusion in building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann also drives to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you cannot speak to a draw from a mis@@ sl@@ ated start , do not know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we can concentrate on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly speak of a proper season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of that , his personal trainer wanted nothing to know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the season evalu@@ ates me only after six to eight players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , who would not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to a we@@ ather@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can begin the season virtually with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even have some fres@@ her , since they had no serious and complete game like Fortuna against a climb f@@ avo@@ red in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not know so 100 @-@ percentage where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inside of the Fortuna . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the guests from the Rhin@@ eland - lighter favor@@ it on Sunday in the encounter at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we put them away , just because we have the claim to come under the first six , is Bl@@ essed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet is very positive in only a defeat against Au@@ e of nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which you have to propose from the outset , &quot; explains Fort@@ unas @-@ coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a such statement would be arrogan@@ t and reason@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday in no way .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ assessment tests published
the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method for medical evaluation of their age , show that over 80 percent of the tested people were older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for for@@ ensi@@ c medicine ( Rät@@ t@@ sm@@ e@@ dic@@ in@@ al@@ en@@ et ) has started conducting the tests last year .
they should be more precise during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish migration agency ( migration flows ) because of errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees were critical .
to date , it has been mail@@ ed 6.@@ 8@@ 80 to test@@ ed cases and the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency has now released the results of total 2.@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency assessed that the person may be 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person might be under 18 years of age . &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the person will be questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , the results in recent months are consistently stable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not see a huge difference in statistics of past months , the numbers are fairly consistent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases where the person has been judged over the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has suffered over its age .
in May the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that it is 4@@ 42 cases give , the &quot; suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska Dag@@ blast the 5@@ 81 published results they found that in 243 these cases the person had been openly stated that she will be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , made in x @-@ ray imaging of we@@ eping @-@ lab@@ eled and MR@@ T recordings are analyzed by br@@ ack@@ ets and radi@@ ologists , was also critic@@ ized in some areas .
a skep@@ tic is the End@@ ok@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of biological maturity of people to see whether they were used sooner or later as usual by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I have reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
to assess the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
if we cannot say it surely we should not do as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; generally speaking , you can say that the risk of being a child as an adult is un@@ correct .
the biggest risk lies in it when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are prog@@ ressing well .
on Wednesday , a seven tons of heavy amount was installed at the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good in the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Bau@@ gli@@ der at the Department of Football and Transport in the Intergovernmental Conference .
in April the works began at the same time at all three san@@ itation bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
construction is provided for October and is sure that the schedule is comp@@ lied with .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ ault bridge from concrete , d@@ ressed with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
as the two other bridges , it has already come into the years .
to ensure the stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges lead to the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , and 10,@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance gate of Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on Wednesday morning on the northern side a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so called lo@@ k cap .
this is a random attachment that is used also as a factory .
on Friday the southern part of the bridge is to be deployed to a total of 40 metres wide fr@@ app@@ y cap on Friday .
then the pedestrian head should go away .
the special thing is that it is about finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ di@@ o .
the other two bridges have already been provided with the pat@@ ented handle @-@ of @-@ arms .
particular f@@ inger@@ tips @-@ feeling has the ver@@ aging of power lines carried out by the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ fi@@ bres that many firms are connected .
the inhabitants were informed in advance of the work carried by ra@@ z@@ ett@@ el about the project .
finally , first fish and canc@@ ers had to be canc@@ eled .
for the bridges between the building buildings and the gathering in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , the traffic @-@ sp@@ uri@@ g is regulated by one amp@@ el .
for construction works at the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher municipal entrance , the road in the area of the bridge to the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den . &quot;
the cost of the three lo@@ aves are together 700 000 Euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under Prot@@ est bei deutsch@@ em Pot@@ els@@ al@@ at
it doesn &apos;t seem so often that parties are pul@@ ling in a cord , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , coming together , what else is difficult to put under a hat .
the parties in the chal@@ ance volcanoes ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ W@@ G , left ) belong to a broad coalition that shows the peaceful flag at this day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle R@@ ond@@ ell to the noisy poster &quot; great election campaign . &quot;
and known names at the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , which formed together with Alexander Thi@@ land , which forms the top of directors for the Bundestag @-@ election on 24 September , and the Vice @-@ CEO Beatri@@ x of Stor@@ k .
but those who are on site already hours before the beginning of the meeting , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D run@@ ners , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eif@@ el remains colorful . &quot;
originally , the city @-@ picnic under the motto &quot; All on a table &quot; was planned at the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but is now taking place at the parking place below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ ak event in the Stadthalle .
a colour@@ ful picture that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the For@@ ums a world and one of the organizers , really pleased : &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot;
there are music and plenty of food , including a &quot; ur@@ German potato salad that could also eat the Af@@ ak without food , &quot; says the woman who has brought him .
the police brought many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence mainly at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the suburbs .
how is the Af@@ gan@@ ese come on Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of the Af@@ D volcan@@ ei@@ fel reported that he tries to make such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had been consul@@ ted first in Dau@@ n , but there was a query , because of the already built Laur@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes did not exist enough parking places .
so the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; looking at the event at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , primary , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also : against 20 o &apos;clock in the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle of various speakers , including the rh@@ et@@ land @-@ pf@@ alz Af@@ D @-@ Chair@@ woman boy boy .
in the hall there are about 200 list@@ ener , who are waiting for the sp@@ itz@@ enk@@ an@@ di@@ dat@@ in for the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Dep@@ uty leader Beatri@@ x of Stor@@ k to keep her speeches .
unchanged is the police presence , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a slightly more than an hour takes the Af@@ D event , the guests on the pitch have a longer breath , but also there is cancelled short after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can move - no special inci@@ dents .

&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the Bulgarian Tromp@@ eter Miros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he is a concert under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwarz@@ meer meets Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bal@@ kan@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to a classical German training with roots in concert music . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and winners of many international competitions and have anti @-@ op@@ positions in European sp@@ inal cord .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter from the prestigious Con@@ cert@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic Bell@@ i is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ vag@@ ist of SWR Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire to exceed the boundaries of their instruments , but also merge the limits of the various gen@@ res .
like Johann Sebastian Bach at the two like in a new gar@@ b , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; combines with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz@@ S@@ ils W@@ ogra@@ m , mix classical , jazz and the free games to a fascinating overall artwork .
this core part of the program was first performed in spring with success in Freiburg .

Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about their Bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ality
&quot; some people love gr@@ illed cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
but I want to try everything &quot; so Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart quite openly about their Bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ality .
&quot; when I come into gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &apos; Oh , that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; .
the probably most well @-@ known relationship of the German wood@@ cock has been the &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ aya , which eventually went bitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all the as@@ sures the eyeb@@ row to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was seriously fallen in love that I d@@ anced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or do you believe , I would have played it ? &quot;
after her separation , Kri@@ sten was too that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed the du@@ alism .
so it has never been confused or ham@@ pered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I just liked it to be taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially among them they suffered out loud &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; but in school time , when she ple@@ d@@ anced like a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
this really has really been inju@@ red .
when I was eleven asking me the children , I would look like a book .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and sham@@ eful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think of me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public do not love their love @-@ life : &quot; people expect you to have a certain manner compar@@ ably and anno@@ yed me .
and maybe some call me as un@@ th@@ ink@@ able , but I don &apos;t like to justify me before the whole public . &quot;
govern@@ or of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic govern@@ or of the West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday nights with a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you a lot of prayers and a lot of re@@ think ... today I will tell you as the inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic govern@@ or . &quot;
the manifestation broke out in che@@ ers .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; says Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a trainer I would say it is time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a great announcement at the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won west Virginia with 42 points , and Justice had not endor@@ se the democratic candidate Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , who is according to For@@ bes of the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state was re @-@ elected .
For@@ bes makes that he possesses coal mining in five states , and inher@@ ited from his father a carbon shop .
it is worth about 1,@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee held a statement on Thursday during which it said : &quot; the party changes of govern@@ or Justice is another blow to a Democratic party which would rather pro@@ hibit us rather than working to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 Gover@@ nor and the control of the least legislative bodies in history is the announcement of govern@@ or Justice only the last ref@@ us@@ al of a party which is from above until below without leadership , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the R@@ NC Chairman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in a statement the C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e lo@@ bt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian Ent@@ schul@@ digung bei D@@ oping @-@ Sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of Ath@@ le@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday , what he described as an obvious discharge from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he repeated , it is not the moment for the country to be back in sports .
Russia Ath@@ le@@ tics chief of Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in said during the IAAF World Congress at the eve of Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct in the sport and that he was determined to fight the d@@ oping .
he said , I am sorry for &quot; all athletes , who were cut off the gold and silver medals . &quot;
despite his comments , the IAAF Congress for the maintenance of prohib@@ itions , which was imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency ( W@@ ada ) notes on stat@@ ely sponsored d@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open response , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IAAF @-@ President Co@@ e the Rep@@ or@@ tern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire convention were pleased that the Russian Federation has realized with himself , that she experienced some rather hot times and do everything possible to make sure that the Federation will be re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Co@@ e said , he was also &quot; delighted &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for his re @-@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force , that this is not the moment to restore Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will start at the Ath@@ le@@ tics world cup , which begin on Friday in London , according to the strict IAAF criteria as neutral actors .
the head of the IAAF World Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia still fulfill some of the criteria for a re @-@ adjustment .
dru@@ d@@ tests are still inadequate and har@@ dened trainers are still free , he said Rep@@ or@@ ters in London after a presentation at IAAF World Council .

the ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dom@@ stadt under high safety precau@@ tions .
for even un@@ resolved deport@@ ation , Minister of Defence said Ursula von der Ley@@ en ( CD@@ U ) nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she drew the two um@@ ented pilots but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability of her professional &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tend to be the highest victim to us in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old and the 47 @-@ year staff of North@@ cape from North@@ h@@ essen were killed on Wednesday a week in the west@@ African Mali .
her companions were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter .
at noon first only took the members of the church Ab@@ schied .
afterwards , the fun@@ eral party began in the circle of the family , closest friends , from representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and the politics .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the Minister of Defense from the Ley@@ en gave the controversial soldiers to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sat@@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

doubts about the UN Mission in Mali was not the use of the Ley@@ en : the use was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of high importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral party the S@@ är@@ ge were brought out of the cathedral .

prince Hen@@ rik had never made a touch of it that he was not happy with his title .
after the thr@@ ust of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would like to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he re@@ tired in 2016 and also put the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prinz@@ ge@@ ma@@ hl &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Prime Minister W@@ eil wants to make quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Nieder@@ sachsen
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dutch Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green ruling majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the farm , he does not want to ref@@ rain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because she spoke on Friday for the resolution of the parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising number of a Green leader had introduced a Green leader in Nieder@@ sachsen the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) in a severe way .
five months before the official date of the agricultural choice , the red @-@ green coalition in Hannover thus lost its scar@@ ce A @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Gre@@ ens @-@ MEP El@@ ke T@@ westen founded their step with the non @-@ nomin@@ ation for the election 2018 in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future at the CD@@ U &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stated it on Friday in Hannover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ U @-@ Fra@@ sanc@@ t@@ ef Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its fac@@ tion to include them .
with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP have had 69 seats in the Lower Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
up to now the ratio was revers@@ ed .
the new tag will be chosen on 14 January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government now decide whether they could not go@@ vern in this situation without a majority .
Stephan W@@ eil does however qualify for indispensable that the country @-@ day decides as quickly as self @-@ determination .
the CD@@ U fac@@ tion is likely to decide on Tuesday for further action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the country &apos;s state also sees the opportunity that the country &apos;s country has chosen the prime minister and choose a successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these options need to be kept in legally clean &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will be deb@@ ated in tranquility all the questions , if they are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inspec@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler named T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a little qu@@ aint . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politicians themselves said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
it signed itself as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanding the pu@@ ties for the return of their land meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of course assume that she has her country meeting , which she has received over the green state , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared the govern@@ or Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the presi@@ dents of the Green Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have deliber@@ ately decided not to lead any pron@@ unci@@ ation in the group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also against the background that there was no priority differences , we cannot follow this step &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SPD @-@ Chancellor Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the over@@ comes of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the CD@@ U &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behavior of the former Gre@@ ens &apos; s in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters and voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Federal Council of Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) to re @-@ elect the tag quickly .
the Austr@@ o @-@ west costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony is the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politicians of politicians in their final van@@ ity and their fru@@ stration have their personal interests primarily for the sake of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ized SPD @-@ Secretary of Hu@@ ber@@ tus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that makes the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony with it and attempts to propose a political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Minister for Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from tox@@ ins , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses more than contamin@@ ated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can the consumer protect themselves .
Minister for Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in the interview with the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) &apos;s speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt , How to protect consumers from po@@ ison@@ ed eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer consumers to look at exactly the eggs in your refrigerator and to review the stamp .
on the consumer portal www.@@ grocery war@@ ri@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ char@@ ms .
affected eggs should be anni@@ hil@@ ated or returned .
even though , after all that we are currently know , a health haz@@ ard can virtually eliminated .
now Al@@ di is taking advantage of the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs are out of the offer - because the central role of the clearing of the federal government is not really perceived ?
the surveillance is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately swit@@ ched immediately and since announ@@ cements from Germany , the subject of Germany is in close contact with the authorities of the countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trade has the same job as the producers to ensure that the products sold @-@ fit and health @-@ safe are harmless . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the amount of resi@@ dual content is exceeded by 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are non @-@ operational .
un@@ load eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time is not the companies to blame .
sitting and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
after a knowledge of knowledge , the production industry has not been an immediate fault .
on the contrary , they have to reck@@ on due to mut@@ in@@ ingly illegal practices of service companies with economic damages .
as always there is too little control in the harvest .
is it only missing on the staff or at the conclusi@@ ve jurisdiction ?
these were just the official controls that have exposed the procedure .
however , the truth is also that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out to 100 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is why a consequ@@ ent enligh@@ tenment of such events and the hand@@ over to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences can be fores@@ een . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made a number of several times that I expect from the responsible authorities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seam@@ less education &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular Al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get exclusively secure and reliable food .
when a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de in the food industry is used , consumer rights and consumers are rightly heard .
through the used means , manufacturers , tra@@ ders and consumers get into a situation which is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the un@@ law@@ ful employment of the insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ ds of Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of the life @-@ capital of the animals is unacceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it has to be consistently working on all levels and on high pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I expect from all competent authorities that the atomic fact is un@@ law@@ ful and un@@ balanced .
how the financial rules of the Football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ hin@@ dering issues of European foot@@ ball@@ ers will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord @-@ Transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power , teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules that have been launched in 2011 from the UEF@@ A in life , mean that PSG sometime has to demonstrate that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) in order to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from its agreement , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a sal@@ ary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PSG can make it easier with certainty for N@@ ey@@ mar , and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team by which through the energy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mer@@ ing family of Qatar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
associations must pay a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but must be with legitimate obj@@ ections , which allow them to make the break @-@ free spot in their land @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to UEF@@ A Presi@@ dents in 2007 .
the former French player believed that promises to have taken enormous debt in their quest for success , effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ky to ruin , when banks or owners ref@@ unded their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P declined from focusing on the debts of the clubs against the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model created the novel Abr@@ amo@@ vich originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then power@@ fully invested to build the crew and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er business .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P voltage period that runs until 2018 , Club may accept losses in the amount of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini 2015 has fallen from the presidency in un@@ gn@@ ation , his UEF@@ A successor Aleks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to rely on excessive spending .
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week .
although the PSG have paid buy @-@ out cl@@ ause from N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat shell , she can distribute the amount for the accounts beyond the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year treaty , so the solution will be reported for the next five years in the amount of € 4@@ 4,4 million in the year financial year .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 made the PSG along with Abu Dhabi which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PSG received a fine of 60 million Euros ( at that $ 82 million dollars ) , which was later dropped to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players will not be limited to normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is in search of clubs that might try to ski@@ p their financial supervision by adjust@@ ing their revenues by companies that are associated with the owners of a club .
while a Catal@@ an enterprise could be the PSG spon@@ der , if the value of sponsor@@ ship should exceed the standard flag@@ ship , the UEF@@ A would not be considered to legitimate income .
it was exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of sponsor@@ ship of the P@@ SA was built by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of the PSG payments to N@@ ey@@ mar , about payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup 2006 in Qatar might come .
but PSG and Kat@@ ar 2022 have argu@@ ed that N@@ ey@@ mar WM will become and a great maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators should simply be figur@@ ing out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sanctions against PSG means that the UEF@@ A will still be more attentive , any attempt to keep in mind the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UEF@@ A had no pre @-@ prepared talks with PSG ProntoSIL N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , re@@ ted on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke in the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation .
the last published reports indicate that PSG 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 54@@ 2 million euros .
accounts for the last year financial year must be released .
PSG expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrive a blessing for sponsor@@ ship De@@ als , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ ck@@ ers .
the association assumes that sales will rise at least 30 percent after the signing of the signature .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated , one of the best football players to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s for@@ ging by claim@@ ing that PSG the FF@@ P would hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial d@@ oping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of La Liga , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS , in terms of cat@@ ol@@ ition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al manager arsen@@ al Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that is financed by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owner and this has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the past 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
it becomes very difficult to respect the financial Fair@@ play , because you have different ways or different interests , if a country has such a big player in order to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is searching for a new mold supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Frey board chocolate was produced for Swiss .
now the sal@@ ute co @-@ operation is standing in front of a possible end : the airline writes the order new .
Swiss @-@ Spre@@ cher@@ in Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Nor@@ thwest Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning the Air@@ line in the first half of the year 2018 will have a new contract .
the products would be reviewed every two or three years and subjected to one quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Frey we are very satisfied , &quot; said the speaker .
some 17 million small red @-@ white sli@@ pped up to 14 grams per year the flight companion in front of the landing to the passengers .
I did not want to make Swiss no information about the costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; industry insi@@ sts in the volume of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nor@@ thwest Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 1.5 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros daughter achieved annual turnover of about 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but more important is all the advertising effects : for a p@@ og@@ gi@@ ver it is a prestigious order .
how many applic@@ ants are there for the new tender , Swiss will not want to betra@@ y Swiss .
but there are only Swiss manufacturers in question .
according to the schedule , Cho@@ col@@ at will want to make a renewal of the contract over the spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da was the largest Swiss cho@@ col@@ ates manufacturer not available for an opinion .
chocolate cl@@ boards are distributed among Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before the Swiss a contract concluded with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry Cal@@ leb@@ aut had delivered in collaboration with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets .
the possibility to place the logo was introduced Swiss one and a half years with the start of the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Frey .
the airline works with several Swiss cho@@ col@@ ates producers .
on long @-@ distance excursions , customers of the first class with le@@ ak were pampered by the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class Na@@ schen passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi from Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Frey .

and there is another crazy f@@ owl P@@ lot , included in the Ronald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Sho@@ walter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always the EX@@ K@@ UR@@ SE are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it makes a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d , the Matt D@@ ill@@ ons Under@@ cover@@ ings of &quot; singles , &quot; whose former Big Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy .

&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now reminds on another kind of no@@ stal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War by &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Blon@@ de &quot; and even on &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ against @-@ West Ring@@ fight @-@ I@@ CO@@ NO@@ GRA@@ PH@@ Y .

the blow against drugs @-@ ma@@ fia in the country
the police is a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday afternoon @-@ morning , in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ B@@ aar @-@ district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Konstan@@ z , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart numerous objects were sear@@ ched for , as the prosec@@ ut@@ or advoc@@ acy was rus@@ hed on Friday .
on this occasion , 15 def@@ endants were arrested between 25 years and 77 years and have already received ar@@ rest warran@@ t against them .
in addition , the officials occupied greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundreds of thousands of Euros .
at the same swe@@ eps in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German ar@@ rest warran@@ t .
for this reason , the two are probably delivered to Germany .
an action involved in the action were Italian and Bay@@ erische Er@@ mitt@@ ler .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the members of the Maf@@ ia will organised drug crimin@@ ality , severe violence , su@@ bre@@ eders and rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mailing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already since summer 2016 the prosec@@ ut@@ or advoc@@ acy for the organised drug trading in the southern German area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Konstan@@ z and Palermo there was a re@@ medi@@ al exchange and the investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
therefore , the grandfather was accompanied by four officials from Palermo and also by four officials from Palermo .
the investigations of studies performed primarily on Italian nation@@ als with respect to the Italian ma@@ fia .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data of citizens , which should not arise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a report is reported that the foreigners &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Register &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has considerable short@@ com@@ ings in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lead to some engra@@ ving ab@@ sent@@ ences in asylum @-@ procedures .
the authorised for the refugee management of the federal government , Frank @-@ Jürgen , has seen a media report , according to large g@@ aps in the country @-@ country registry .
defects in the data recorded there could lead in asylum proceedings and deport@@ ations &quot; to the severe lack of mis@@ decisions , &quot; the way in an analysis that the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; lies ahead .
in the register the data are estimated that ten million people with foreign nation@@ ality , including about 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore managed by some 600 pay@@ ers in Germany .
because the data had not been sufficiently well maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good .
in cases , data from 1921 has been found , &quot; by people who have long been no longer in life , or by citizens who have become German citizens , and in the register no longer should arise . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faul@@ ty data entry can be significantly slow@@ ed back &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it says the report continues after . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in statistics about multi @-@ day people are survi@@ ving EU citizens who would not have to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such wrong regulations led to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dist@@ orted debate on dealing with emig@@ rate &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is therefore in analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the federal government has apparently begun to reg@@ ain refugee families with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children once they came across from there .
this goes forth from an internal paper of the Federal Stati@@ stical Institute for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , the &quot; Neue Osnab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper it means that BA@@ MF does not mean such a procedure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding families with children - except inf@@ ants and inf@@ ants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , it was practically no longer possible , so the paper under reference to the difficult situation on site .
after the Dublin agreement , it is responsible for refugees of the EU state to reach them first .
if a migrant is travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the reason I write the office : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the recording capacity for families with min@@ der@@ old children in Italy increases substantially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy made up for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EG@@ M@@ R ) keep these commitments for adequate .
other EU states would also send refugees back to the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the inter@@ im political spokes@@ man in the Bundestag , Ul@@ la Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ized this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten due to the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system of un@@ law@@ ful conditions and a haz@@ ard of cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explain the prot@@ ector of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ C ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , because the preser@@ ves are crus@@ hed into their components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s how three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported by the actions that are carried out in Spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; this year we achieved using 114 Sp@@ en@@ dern the second @-@ best result , &quot; said the DR@@ K county leader .

the Bank of England will retain the interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England will likely be announced later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and mit@@ igation of inflation have absorbed spec@@ ulation over a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they held the interest rates on family income in the midst of a intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the policy makers of the European Committee ( MP@@ C ) of the Bank signed with 6 to 2 for ensuring the interest rates on 0.25 % , in this month less member states a rise , since the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly review report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and by 2018 on 1.6 percent and warned that the pressure on the household will continue to continue , whereby inflation in autumn is expected to rise to almost 3 % .
but they sign@@ aled that in the next few years Zin@@ ser@@ ums would be necessary to bre@@ w the inflation of Bre@@ xit and she said that the bor@@ dering costs may need more than expected on the financial markets .
the members also voted to retreat a part of the Mam@@ mut Konjunk@@ tur@@ pak@@ ets , which was published a year after the Bre@@ xit .
it is time for funding for funding to provide cheap funds for banks since the coming February is expected that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central progno@@ sis of the MP@@ C remains the gross domestic product ( GDP ) , in the short term , since pressure on the real@@ ms of budgets continues to be charged further consumption . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the rate of interest rates , she reiter@@ ated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain imp@@ lication of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be required for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat greater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent than markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
markets pre@@ di@@ ct the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another year 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grad@@ ual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the growth forecasts for this year following the growth forecasts for this year and next year are expected to be forec@@ ast@@ ed 1.9 % and 1.7 % .
it has maintained its growth forecasts for 1.8 percent in 2018 .
the pound fell upon these messages compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to the US dollar and fell by 0,4 % to 1.11 Euro .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appointing growing expectations of the rising expectations on a zinc levels , and GDP has increased in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will be easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year .
the most recent infl@@ ation@@ ary report gives little enthusiasm for households , affected by rising inflation and low @-@ level stages , as the tigh@@ tening first becomes worse before they get better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy cannot prevent the income of policy in the next few years , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages to the end of their three @-@ year plan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be clear &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also enhanced by increasing demand for British goods which is attri@@ but@@ able to the weak pound rather than to compens@@ ate for a portion of lower consumer spending .
the decision comes after lo@@ wering the interest rates to 0.25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote which has caused the sin@@ king &apos;s sin@@ king .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
prior to the last judgment of the Bank to the interest rates , the call was increased after a Zin@@ o@@ ber , the inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressing households , with three political decision makers in July a rise at 0.5 % .
inflation has declined in the last month of 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2,6 % , although the bank said that this was expected and will come back in the coming months .
the Bank said that exce@@ eding 2 % is in relation to their goal of 2 % to be &quot; very &quot; to the weak pounds .
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Co@@ reco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; given the shorter re@@ viewer of the s@@ wap market , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive , as the len@@ ders want to search a lot according to shops and would like to end the year in a positive way .
the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing de@@ position are ex@@ clude and the new mort@@ g@@ ages ref@@ rain , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National health services ) is intended to pres@@ cribe HIV @-@ Dro@@ ge 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients will be preserved from September following a fight against the High Court against financing the drug in the N@@ HS access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV treatment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England has announced that a pre @-@ recorded pre @-@ acquisition phy@@ la@@ xe ( pre@@ p ) which can decrease the Inf@@ ect risk of nearly 86 percent , now provided by health service over a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the process after the Appe@@ al court had confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court last year that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess news announced by N@@ HS England &apos;s Chief Simon Stev@@ ens was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) this referred to as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brigh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to follow the registration of people and further clinics will be following in October , before it will be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018 .
pre@@ text positioning phy@@ la@@ xe ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV medicines that will be taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p reduces the HIV transmission in infection risk .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines in the body of a person are present to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before intercourse .
to those who come to issue are gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , Trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV positive partners who were not treated successfully .
in clinics are identified suitable participants that will agree with the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment .
people who live in England and registered with a doctor &apos;s doctor can also opt for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the delivery of medicines that week in this week after an international competitive procurement .
the study is intended to assess the entire potential of pre@@ p by using clinical ass@@ essm@@ ents , how it is targeted and implemented on a large scale .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this big new intervention should complement the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts for preventing HIV supplement and over@@ hau@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades lasting progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .

we welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now lie that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one gets left at risk for HIV .

Shar@@ on Hod@@ g@@ son , shadow @-@ health ministers , said : &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome after monthly laun@@ ches and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government welcome and over@@ due .
the evidence demonstrate how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can termin@@ ate the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people that are infected with HIV , and that it will help to end the spread of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living in large living : mezzanine and clever designers have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced in 2014 from a large house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has@@ n &apos;t packed their bags and sold .
&quot; before , I lived with my ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I sear@@ ched for something that was comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceil@@ ings .
I have fallen in love in her and made an offer this day . &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot of the apartment was completely out@@ dated .
originally a one @-@ bedroom estate with a screw@@ ed layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceil@@ ings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she instruc@@ ted the Architektur@@ - and Design@@ studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill that made the 12.@@ 5 feet high ceil@@ ings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two spaces over to each other , so the archit@@ ect@@ on@@ ical challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the award .
&quot; the steel plant is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the spaces so they were over@@ thrown , without we had to g@@ aps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not just about building a simple platform but to create the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or at the bottom . &quot;
this arrangement allowed it to place Er@@ fan , two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine can look back a classic copper @-@ window from ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us via the gl@@ am@@ orous apart@@ ement .
temper@@ ed Gold@@ st@@ alls , Silber@@ ne Ak@@ z@@ ente and Vintage Serge Mou@@ ille lights set the style for the program .
the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both En@@ den a short cor@@ ridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to let him last longer .
in the kitchen the mirror feel like a window into another room .
at the entrance we have cleaned units for all the seating and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ am@@ orous space the beauty of the sitting room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the speci@@ fic@@ s of this is that it is a clo@@ cking door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , frigh@@ tened MD@@ F door .
&quot; it is opposite , so that when you push the door , very easy going . &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage room , Jo@@ anne additional 16 m ² gain , an extra bedroom and a improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land , or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and have a calculation on the ground size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high quality materials to gain access to this luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and therefore help create an emotional relationship in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you don &apos;t love you into the electric so@@ ckets in the walls .
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be characterized by good design and increased square met@@ ric capacity of slightly by default into something very amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave these not .
brothers fighting because of a 500 million US dollar @-@ imperial
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a confrontation due to one of the largest im@@ imperative Victoria worth more than 500 million dollars .
the former Director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court of Justice to clarify how their property and business shall be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers poss@@ essing 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , then the family since 1973 has bought a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
the family founded West@@ co Je@@ ans and grew up to a chain of 160 retailers .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now comprises offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler , as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
according to an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - by Paul is described as &quot; main operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the company &apos;s company and Paul about one third .
a judicial record under@@ lines that Col@@ in has a value of $ 35,@@ 000 million dollars and Paul in a value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be problematic for Paul as a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the results proposed by Col@@ in proposed have left him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote 2015 in a first Aff@@ av@@ it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday last Friday I took place the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice .
the brothers also fight to control over the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claimed to have excluded him .
Col@@ in argu@@ ed that this is not true , but casts Paul in front of managing some poss@@ essions in@@ competent .
in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that was filed with Col@@ in , he says he hope to establish the dispute .
&quot; my Italian heritage wrote that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ li@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides of a lawyers .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her husband husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the dairy bars and delic@@ acy stores from the late 1950 @-@ he , and in the early 19@@ 50s a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick bought .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in Col@@ in the first je@@ ans of the family opened .
Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co , when he was &quot; in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed their property to pass on to her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to land the brothers in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis group , with Col@@ in claimed that Mark was paid by the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has kept very back , although he was a former AF@@ L management board and after a biography from the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and her attor@@ neys .
only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case before the courts is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very very sad that my brother Paul has decided to acc@@ use me and move our family names through the courts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; our father did not have awak@@ ened that Paul and I would say in our current dispute , &quot; he said , and he added that he is still hoping for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our business will be resolved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
m@@ umps of new grid st@@ amps is planning to limit the media ab@@ stin@@ ence of the president .
others have tried and have failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Polit@@ ico reports that the new Bar@@ op of the White House is planning to limit the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including the reports of the news media - in the hope to keep the chef on a moderate course .
here is a piece of Rep@@ orter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; as John F. Kelly , the new staff member of the White House , at his first working day with leading employees , he set a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps white House that he wants to fix : bad information , which got into the hands of the president .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letters - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ aps Tr@@ ump by monitoring his media .
President Tr@@ umps relationship to television reaches decades - and now where he is in the White House , his TV @-@ coloring was still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Candi@@ did@@ at Tr@@ ump was anno@@ yed because of an unfair coverage it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places to convince , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the former elec@@ toral consultant Sam Nun@@ berg in February to Polit@@ ico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Polit@@ icos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key to keep t@@ umps Twitter @-@ habit in control , according to six former elec@@ toral campaign , ensuring that his personal media accounts ent@@ ail a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ umps Twitter @-@ habit ever &quot; was &quot; under control &quot; is ridic@@ ulous .
perhaps those fighting on something we don &apos;t know anything that we don &apos;t know - that stret@@ cher Twe@@ ets without their interventions would have made even more ign@@ ition .
we will probably never find out something about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his associates have made it a few times , to keep away from him , their efforts have been worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but no @-@ one has taken it consistently that Tr@@ ump Kont@@ ro@@ ver@@ sen eman@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
part of the problem is that people in a White House that reli@@ es on competing parties repeatedly calling for their own agenda by promoting foot@@ b@@ ump material that possibly promotes their views from the world .
Polit@@ ico - quite with this story - reported in May on the preference of advis@@ ors to as@@ sign the President for strategic reasons .
this was an example that was described by Rep@@ orter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump as a volcano can react to negative press issues , especially those with damaged le@@ aks and that he can turn out to get out where these origin@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly this happened in late February , when someone gave the President mal@@ icious one @-@ printed copy of a article from Got@@ news@@ .com , the website of the internet Prov@@ ok@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who announced the Dep@@ uty Stab@@ ili@@ ation K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a bunch of Lec@@ ks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson had banned from Twitter because of chic@@ ane or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he expressed wrong accus@@ ations and in@@ voke it in the past .
Tr@@ ump las den article and began to ask employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the dam@@ p Stab@@ ili@@ ef Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the Tr@@ ump . &quot;
how has that folded ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager as pri@@ st@@ us , but tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ers still seek influence .
this un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
Master sear@@ ched Po@@ ars received mail from Euro@@ pol

the police all over Europe are sent to this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to a dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
since the addresses of the requested sword @-@ crus@@ her natur@@ als did not become known , references from the population will gain and pray .
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Most W@@ anted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calendar of winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences have shown that many refugees hide my holiday destinations , it was on the part of Euro@@ pol .
there are 21 post@@ cards for sear@@ ched crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , there has been www@@ .e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted website to have more than 2.5 million times this year .

travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to &apos; million &apos; million &apos; series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some decisive travelers on war F@@ oot that have negotiated one of the community drawn dit@@ ch to re@@ claim a field in front of their mist@@ ress .
the travelers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside of a prosper@@ ous street from Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; milli@@ on@@ aire series . &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and an army of transportation , having been de@@ du@@ ed only in May , without being hi@@ pped off from the advice of excav@@ ated gr@@ aben in order to prevent their accidents .
the tak@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense units and pressing their vehicles by a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry inhabitants have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous residents said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have moved there on the Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they were thrown on the p@@ asser@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced to implement it , as he used to be used when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are back again .
more came yesterday evening , probably still more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to cope with it by keeping long under@@ taking to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I live on the fisher@@ man bro@@ ok Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my common cause , if the Council does not even stop it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a few people who did not want to be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is ridic@@ ulous , we just saw the last round of these travelers just to pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the figures have been raised this time and you even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot;
speaking of the Council of Soli@@ hull , commented : &quot; we are fully aware of a un@@ authorized bearing on the country beyond the fisher@@ man bro@@ ok Road and working with the police of soli@@ ds . we take the necessary legal steps to proceed as soon as possible .
to support our Mobile Ph@@ ones , it is very important that as many inhabitants as many inhabitants sign a anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating an image of the situation in which the court needs to consider when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
aus Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is made of the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the dam@@ al@@ ous ambience company mbH to 13 April 2014 the period of around 30 000 nights will be lost per year and also recei@@ pts from the tourist tax .
in the autumn of 2014 , there was dramatically increasing numbers of refugees that came to the county coun@@ ties , the hotel buildings to the land office as a collective accommodation , was arranged for contro@@ vers@@ y discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a development plan in order to secure the area as a hotel location .
at that time the decision was not un@@ disp@@ uted at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but above all Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Ober@@ bourgeois @-@ Master Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke at that time from harvest of interest in the house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was right to reserve .
with a chair@@ men with chair@@ men Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , with its head office in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has acquired a voluntary refin@@ ement in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star @-@ Plus Category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object four houses .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad men@@ al@@ b .
you are looking for Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the earlier Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof I have been working for a long time period of construction and in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house , it becomes apparent , what extensive renovation work will be made .
the so@@ ils were cut out , blan@@ kets as part de@@ built , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald@@ style .
the rooms are fitted with large buried showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows will be installed .
everything sol@@ le later &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; become as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , spa area and a meeting room are part of the facilities .
we would not want to position itself at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale city level , he stressed .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms are set up wide , the Scot@@ ers are further along .
both individual holiday makers , groups or busin@@ ess@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
talks with OB Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourismus@@ dire@@ ktor Michael Kr@@ ause he already led , so Sch@@ erer .
the ideas of the city are covered with those of the hotel group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are on the same line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the amount of investments questioned Thomas Sch@@ erer wants to determine precisely .
just below one million euros , he expects .
also the exterior plants are brought to the front , which is already visible clearly .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is open from the restaurant , which is publicly available .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ äre : us @-@ Sonder@@ angebote investig@@ ator sets Grand Jury
in the Russia affair at US @-@ President Donald Tr@@ ump , Robert Mu@@ eller should have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury in a report .
the Panel included work in the past weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; on appeal to persons familiar with the cause .
the newspaper advis@@ es the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller extended his investig@@ ators and intensified .
the radio CN@@ N reported it already give initial pre @-@ inv@@ itations to the Gre@@ mi@@ ums in connection with a meeting between m@@ umps , son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies ac@@ ul@@ ing the Krem@@ lin for longer to register in the presidential election in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether there was an agreement between Ha@@ umps elec@@ toral campaigns and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigation , several men should stand in the campaign as advis@@ er of the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ants .
according to that , Mu@@ eller also took more and more t@@ umps priv@@ ates and business environment under the micro@@ scope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special investig@@ ator has moved to the center and seek the accus@@ ations whether the president could hin@@ der the judiciary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine and decide this evidence in possible break@@ down cases and to decide whether an indic@@ t@@ ment is to be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also named counts .
mostly they are swit@@ ched on when it is about larger and contro@@ vers@@ y cases .
the process is always made behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be enabled by the prosec@@ ut@@ or &apos;s prosec@@ ut@@ or to pre @-@ charge people on the hearing under E@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N channels , pre @-@ lad@@ ders have already been issued to turn the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
individuals who were involved in the meeting had been asked to report a statement , it says in the report .
moreover , they should provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. were also Tr@@ umps consultants and father @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed Kus@@ h@@ ner as well as his dam@@ al election campaign , Paul Man@@ a@@ fort , during the interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legal experts said on Thursday nights on the US television that the im@@ position declar@@ es that Mu@@ eller would not be shy away in his work and that he should be necessary to act quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be swit@@ ched at the end to decide on the survey of an indic@@ t@@ ment .
however , the suspension of the body of the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason of concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President on Thursday evening took a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia Aff@@ äre as a campaign against his political opponents .
&quot; the Russia @-@ story is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
the theme give the Democrats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about it . &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in an opinion , he doesn &apos;t know anything about the replacement of a Grand Jury .
this work , however , is also usually in secret , stressed .
the White House feared all measures that acceler@@ ated the work of special investig@@ ators in the &quot; fair &quot; way .
the former F@@ BI boss James Com@@ ey has told three times that not against the president will be determined .
you have no reason to suppose that something changed to it , it says in the Declaration .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fallen .
because of these ra@@ wur@@ fs were pro@@ sp@@ ant for Tr@@ ump , he wanted to hin@@ der the judiciary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ bat said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump have asked him for an attitude of the investigation against the former national security consultant Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president is on great print because of the examination .
after presentation of U.S. media , the White House gathered material against the special mor@@ nings and its employees .
the del@@ e@@ est spec@@ ulation about whether the Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller is fre@@ ed .
unlike an independent Special investig@@ ators of the congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair of the later President Richard Ni@@ x@@ on , Mu@@ eller got a position in which he could theoretically have been directed at ur@@ ging of the President of the Prosec@@ ution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several Sen@@ ators of both parties want to prev@@ ent@@ able such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators put on Thursday prosec@@ ution , according to which the special investig@@ ator could not be released so easily .
Antarc@@ tic : gigantic ic@@ eberg is driving in the Antarc@@ tic
in the West @-@ Antarc@@ tic there has been a gigantic ic@@ eberg of the du@@ ly @-@ fold size of Berlin from the Schel@@ fei@@ ge .
so that was the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener @-@ Institute for Polar@@ - and marine research on Wednesday .
the over one tr@@ illion tons heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers large KO@@ LO@@ SS t@@ rei@@ be now north and will probably take two , three years until he mel@@ ted .
it is with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the biggest ic@@ eb@@ radi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
he does not go any danger for people from him .
however , climate change has played a role in the break@@ down of the ic@@ eberg , is un@@ clear to research .
however , for some 30 years there has been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact @-@ background .
according to many researchers , this can be related to the heating .
the KO@@ LO@@ SS has so far been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Schel@@ fei@@ s .
Schel@@ del@@ is swim in the sea and is fed by the gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it continues to grow in the sea and regularly breaks off .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula .
north of this area of Schel@@ fe@@ ises was the balance of w@@ ax@@ ing and breaking down a few years ago .
a complete Schel@@ fei@@ s would be tor@@ n there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of things that also the Lar@@ sen @-@ C &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war@@ eh@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in danger , because the previous Kan@@ te have never with@@ drawn as far as currently . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the ice @-@ sand@@ wich also stands under tension and can also be dis@@ car@@ ded , if at a key place a piece was sli@@ pped off .
the mel@@ ting of Schel@@ fei@@ s and Ic@@ eberg does not increase the sea level , since they float on the water and put ice on so much water as it gives after the mel@@ ting itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the loss of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schel@@ fe@@ at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can go straight into the sea and can get much faster than before . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in the lower dimensions , the British research project writes to the observation of the Antarc@@ tic ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ fei@@ s is home to A@@ WI @-@ details with almost 50 000 square kilometres , the fourth biggest Schel@@ fei@@ s of the Antarc@@ tic .
the transition from the mainland is up to 700 metres thick , with the edge to the open ocean of around 200 meters .
there , it is regularly net@@ worked .
&quot; even though it is a natural happening and we have no direct connection to climate change , the ic@@ ist comes now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the far withdrawal from the beginning of the records &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he confirmed also . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under scientists this dispute was controversial , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Schel@@ fei@@ s will be back again or in the long run , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and she added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even if these researchers don &apos;t withdraw the break@@ age of this gigantic ic@@ eberg not to climate change , so many of the recent decades will fall into the Antarc@@ tic peninsula in recent decades .
this long treasure of the Antarc@@ tic extends in the direction of South America .
according to data from the research programme of British Antarc@@ tic Sur@@ vey , the ice @-@ area of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula has gone around 28 000 square kilometers .
the decline has contributed to the decrease in the temperature of the temperature .
the Antarc@@ tic peninsula has passed over 50 years in the past 50 years and en@@ forced into the areas where the temperature is fastest .
CD@@ U wants front @-@ if at the personnel
because it is becoming more difficult to occupy free spaces , the CD@@ U calls to step out of the employer to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break the chal@@ ance has won 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the management board in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 tra@@ inees now have their first working day .
the teaching at the circle is obviously very popular .
around 620 applications were registered for the places in this year .
nevertheless , the circle continues to be able to cope with the growing demands and tasks .
at present , there is still 50 non @-@ occupied positions at the circle M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things physicians and Engine@@ ers as well as the forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U would now like to seize the initiative in chal@@ k with the F@@ DP and U@@ W@@ G initiative and who oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the administration is intended to create a concept for recruitment and personnel development after the desire of the parties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to cover not only short term needs for professionals , but future @-@ oriented of the application war@@ dice , it means .
the overall concept should be based on both extern@@ ally and extern@@ ally , concrete measures for new@@ com@@ ers and contain a training @-@ so@@ ff@@ sive , ask CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ W@@ G .
this sounds already after a good approach .
because the circle has it with staff @-@ problems that you did not know before .
other cities are showing good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is by a right @-@ right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this gives a high number of employees , the disease and age caused by the Service .
thus , the highest time for action thus do not remain un@@ occupied even more places .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CD@@ U , continues to go beyond joint application with his party .
he had long ago had a marked surprise for a fine @-@ time surprise when he was publicly proclaimed a charge of personnel @-@ deck@@ er and gave the other parties bl@@ ossom .
peoples want to be reviewed all possibilities which enable a withdrawal from the local employer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not arrive at short notice to a satisfactory solution , the rot@@ ational government should seek the trade unions - perhaps also in collaboration with the circular towns - a home @-@ if &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so peoples &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the CD@@ U tries to pay its employees and officials to better pay the collective work to the public service .
sal@@ aries are currently being pre @-@ written , cre@@ ases or more money there are only when you switch to a higher level that are oriented towards professional years of age .
however , the tasks of the circle have increasingly grown over the past few years .
only a few weeks ago new rooms had to be set up in which employees to take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute .
not least thanks to the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ dire@@ ktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tened the tone of NGOs &quot; migrants &quot; lif@@ ebo@@ at
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea , warned that they should not continue this if they are not keeping up new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not write a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister Marco Min@@ nit@@ i in an interview with the Tur@@ ns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; La STA@@ MP@@ A &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Min@@ nit@@ is warning came a day after the Italian authorities had sei@@ zed a boat of the German aid organisation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Youth Save &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because their team had worked together with human trafficking in a way that has facilit@@ ated illegal immigration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aid organisation which has only been in use for one year since a year , it bor@@ row@@ ed to open up with a detailed pro@@ aches of the Italian state of Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the salvation of human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and lif@@ egu@@ ard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organisation in an opinion on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only assess any alleg@@ ations that are currently being raised only after we have collected all the information and that the situation can be judged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had the boat of &quot; youth &quot; Save the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , which had been monitoring since October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is thought that its occupation will take ding@@ hy migrants that are delivered directly by human traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gler can be trac@@ ed so that the ships can be used again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one such an agreement was supp@@ os@@ edly only 1,3 miles in front of the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the state wal@@ nut , the contents of Italian media was published .
the occupation is suspic@@ ious about the authority of the Italian coastal guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons , and not from any other mot@@ if@@ s .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta have mainly called an Italian police officer to sur@@ vey@@ ed their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs , who are involved in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to keep in the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would act as unnecessary but acceptable , since they would not bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant changes or need &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate @-@ organization doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ nit@@ i said , meanwhile , the number of migrants that arrived in Italy to rescue their rescue operations in Italy , over the past weeks have declined , in the efforts to reinforce the Libyan coast guard and the cooperation with the local citizens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month about economic development initiatives and with Tsch@@ ad , N@@ iger and Mali on measures aimed at reducing the number of migrants that have left these countries in hope to achieve Europe .

nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer Bik@@ er , the &quot; Berlin outdoor post &quot; and two guest @-@ drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the Nor@@ pf@@ alz region , to enjoy four days in Tri@@ als and attractions .
there were three friend@@ ed guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ enh@@ ei@@ mer valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est by Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led during hot summer temperatures along the vineyard to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
it followed viewing points , partly on towers , from which one could have a far view over the forest of the forest and the prevailing layers .
in between there was more and more time to reward for the long tri@@ umph .
on the second day it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and folk Palace .

console instead of law@@ ns - Bundes@@ liga accessories for e @-@ sport
will the Sport @-@ Stars will be sitting in front of computer con@@ soles rather than struggling with wind and weather over the stadium ?
the fact is : e @-@ sport is long since a ern@@ most growing industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high charges included .
they have also recognized the first Bundes@@ lig@@ aver@@ a which increasingly engage in this area .
the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg began in 2015 , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and recently the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , founded in mid July an e @-@ Sport @-@ department and two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope that will inspire completely new young audi@@ ences to the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is certain that on these train they still need to rise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the coming weekend the football @-@ World Association hosted FIFA in London the first &quot; Inter@@ active Club World Cup , &quot; in which the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , such as Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven was qualified .
also Robin Dut@@ t also sees great potential in the E @-@ Sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Wer@@ der Bremen , now advis@@ es a agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real football must address in particular with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ old , that young people will continue to go into the stadium , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the associations were tried to con@@ quer all kinds of markets , especially the Asian , to con@@ quer .
with celebr@@ ity e @-@ athletes on the contract , one could be more often more often on these markets than once a year send the Bundes@@ lig@@ aments to Asia once a year .
what is the matter ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the E @-@ Sport computer games &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; League Of Leg@@ ends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or even the soccer simulation of FIFA on competition level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
long ago , like in normal sport , Li@@ gen established , in which the pro@@ s themselves compete against each other .
and in the Asian countries , e @-@ sport is already part of the official programme .
but is it all a right kind of sport ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many , the performance is certainly unusual . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ingo F@@ rob@@ ious has had a long time with the question .
for the professor at the German Spor@@ tho@@ ch@@ schule in Cologne is E @-@ Sport a sport because it is competent and many biological and physical reactions to show that one can also find in classical sport - for example , elevated cardiovascular , stress@@ ful changes .
moreover it has cogn@@ itive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick reaction capability .
professional gam@@ ers should not only be on the console , but also train their body and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fit@@ ter players is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ ous also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; d@@ oping is becoming more and more a theme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to execute on online play , and in the scene the structures of classical sport .
positively highlights the scientists set the high integ@@ rative effect of the e @-@ sport .
the players are internationally active , this is like a big global family , there are no inter@@ cultural affairs .
a study of corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Inter@@ active Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the rapid growth ahead of the E @-@ Sport .
in 2016 , it has been implemented in Germany 50 million euros , mainly about advertising , sponsor@@ ship and great tournaments .
in three years sales will be expected to be 130 million .
the Bundes@@ liga has a little less than 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga .
however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants .
international are many countries further .
great markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball ho@@ op er Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez participate in the US team N@@ RG es@@ ports .
Hollywood @-@ actor Ashton co@@ oker is investing in the e@@ Sport @-@ Wett@@ provider Uni@@ cr@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in Europe does a lot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an Norwegian school , be E @-@ Sport as a class , F@@ rob@@ ous says .
in the Netherlands and in France the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Ver@@ a according to Dut@@ t is now obliged to establish an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany lag@@ ging &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Management Board of Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann .
only in no@@ stal@@ gia can fall , and the ancient times are to clarify today is no longer sufficient .
it is about to preserve the tradition of the association , but the company at the same time set up the modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digit@@ ised world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dut@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there you can &apos;t keep in mind that only when football remains as it always was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter because of the lyrics , the Con@@ rad Roy was condemned for su@@ icide , condem@@ ns
a woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years because she has encouraged her boyfriend through texts and calls for su@@ icide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condem@@ nation behind Git@@ tern and five years were exposed on par@@ ole .
Carter was sentenced to life in June because of the Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday during the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is infinite . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free until appeal .
she had been faced with a maximum of 20 years , but their legal representatives argue that both she and Mr Roy suffered in a psych@@ ic disease .
in red tro@@ users and a cre@@ el colored bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward eyes when it was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your actions have brought Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the prosec@@ ut@@ or &apos;s court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it ended his life to make their own better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it has no responsibility taken over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not showed a Reu@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but car@@ ters lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; horri@@ ble circum@@ stance that it is totally regre@@ t@@ table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , he did not find out that their &quot; age or maturity or even their cl@@ ergy disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a prosec@@ ut@@ or read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who poss@@ essed that there &apos;s no day at which I smok@@ es the loss of my beloved Son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want it to be proud of me and as I go with everything . I try , in spite of all my p@@ ains that we will carry with us for eternity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will be persec@@ uted by the knowledge &quot; I will never be taking part in the wedding of her brother or be a a@@ unt for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no more this only person to have with whom I got together every day since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep in mind for the rest of my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to place a legal preced@@ ent as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to commit another , su@@ icide , su@@ icide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon @-@ oxid@@ ation ventilation in a vehicle .
the case brought national attention to himself , un@@ covered , un@@ covered , that she has encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; Hän@@ g dich , spring out of a building , kitchen yourself , I do not know there are many ways , &quot; she told in several messages that she was sent in two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his su@@ icide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all you have to do is switch the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter was searching through the death of Roy and ord@@ ained that they will benefit by some press from the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few , Carter defended , belonged Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was sentenced in Italy for murder of their British ro@@ omm@@ ate before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times published a comment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua was able to walk at the Audi Cup as a captain , is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner a great season to - Extra motivation is not there .
something was different from his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing very , very small .
but there is far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups , of course no Philipp L@@ eng@@ o and also not a Manuel Neu@@ er , he made himself p@@ umped on his arm .
&quot; the coach did not announce it , &quot; told the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner , after his first use as Bavaria cap .
good that could have been better running than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of co@@ aches could also indicate this way .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was in the youth games , de@@ cks and just received from the holiday professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f , as a leader , but he .
sugar@@ s can be spread most at the best ones who want to keep a lot of blood that you want to keep at La@@ une .
who@@ ever was au@@ ser@@ k@@ ool to put up the legacy of Lah@@ m , can have a small extra motivation just fine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ imm@@ ich confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player wants to take on responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday f@@ las@@ hed the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as mini @-@ Lah@@ m above the field .
to the right behind , this is now its position , the white Bin@@ de on the arm did its rest .
and in fact K@@ imm@@ ich in this inter@@ formation like the one who can take the ruin right into the hand .
he gave instructions , tried to ste@@ er the un@@ played trou@@ pe .
he had the view for the whole , while many others were occupied with themselves .
Vid@@ al to play its missing fitness ( folding scar@@ c@@ ely ) ; Renato plumbing is to make the devil come out to the achievements of Asia trip ( folding also only ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus don &apos;t impact on their first appearance in the Bayern Tri@@ k@@ ot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these at least folding very good &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sü@@ le ran alongside K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y before the def@@ ences on , both ag@@ inated sou@@ ver@@ n .
the well @-@ occupied Napoli @-@ storm was often difficult , moreover , the sweet@@ le tried to grow a few times in the game @-@ building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Rud@@ y gave rise to that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not that way we were hop@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; playing shift , tem@@ po@@ change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how un@@ inhabited this Bayern @-@ World still lives for the re@@ accessible , it looked after the game .
Rud@@ y for example gave not one or two , but surely six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ i said after a couple of cr@@ aked statements in the back of his new fellow @-@ players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here he heard from Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is happening here , I already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria you just need to win any game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he does not have to teach the new one more .

Audi is to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW that it would offer you to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW Chairman said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company was the opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is smar@@ ter options for vehicle limits , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich where BMW is sitting and to restrict or limit diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the entrepreneurs as a recall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the compliance of regulations for carbon emissions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the nit@@ rogen ox@@ ides , the diesel engines , are considered car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ s and can cause as@@ thma .
the cost of automobile manufacturers to install equipment for neutr@@ alization of the rot@@ atable ab@@ norm@@ ase , also take into what it makes difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel will also pay for the powerful automobile companies and ignore signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called air@@ age devices that regulate emissions when a car was tested , but with normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several employees were indic@@ ted by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics in the engine development of Audi was arrested in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Itali@@ ans and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be brought to court in the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier this year Audi was involved in German crimin@@ als , after the authorities began to have a system installed to circum@@ v@@ ise the emissions requirements in Europe and a request that focused on the United States has been expanded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could mean Volkswagen heavy loads : the luxury automobile manufacturers will be over@@ proportional to the profit of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los b@@ oll@@ es and the laughter with the suffering
Mor@@ dil@@ lo was time @-@ wise one of the best @-@ published carto@@ on@@ on dra@@ wer , the b@@ oll@@ es of his figures are its trademark .
also with 85 marks the Argentin@@ ian still and works on a film .
his message : laughter , &quot; as there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ dil@@ lo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he struck himself as a dra@@ ft@@ sman for happiness cards - what makes him frustr@@ ated .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when my job lost , &quot; he said once .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris at the end of the 60s , he managed to match its carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ dil@@ lo found many fans .
always inspired by the artists of cities .
large , round Mor@@ dil@@ lo figures are located in drawings with the called Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he is sitting on his own personal data , and still today in the drawing , it works almost ten hours a day .
about calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ shirts , Pl@@ ush @-@ animals and watches will continue to find his d@@ rol@@ ed figures continue to spread worldwide .
for six years he has been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the main person in the movie &quot; Crazy Island &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los popular animal in his drawings - one has thousands of thousands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time his figures speak in the 3D @-@ film , the 2019 is to come to the kin@@ ks .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what they will say , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ dil@@ lo .
the screen@@ play will not be written by him .
that is why it is more foc@@ uss@@ ed on the TV series , which is produced as its original design@@ ations .
lav@@ ender from Provence threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but it is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the lav@@ ender is because of the d@@ rought to bear the conditions and because of the diseases @-@ borne insects sc@@ ann@@ ed , what scientists and farmers who try to find solutions that prepar@@ es big head@@ aches .
Eric Sch@@ isse , Expert of the Agri@@ cultural Institute of CRI@@ E@@ PP@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the L@@ aven@@ del in Provence is effectively com@@ promised , because the plant was exposed to the effects of climate change in the spring , much less rainy in spring and autumn a lot more .
this has effects on the life of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small cic@@ adas , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the Zwer@@ g@@ zi@@ k@@ aden and with very dry weather , there are a lot of them . &quot;
and there is much at stake .
lav@@ ender oil cra@@ fted not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very important for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant tubes with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either lack or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with etheric oil . &quot;
among the solutions that are considered to be considered a better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of the dark band@@ ing out of the ground , but also the b@@ lowing of plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness .

the ass@@ ass@@ ination of a journalist stresses the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the Week@@ ly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce usually meet in tw@@ o@@ chs to check their plans for the coverage of the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a , through organised crime , corrupt officials and ceas@@ eless drug wars .
but that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told to them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists will discuss what feels more secure : they are supposed to take her children to the office which were the aim of an attack with gran@@ ulates , or let them go home .
security experts have written three words on a plate at the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .
they ask the re@@ porter , names for each column - no proof is needed , percep@@ tions and abs .
there are drugs en@@ mu@@ g@@ gler , politicians , busin@@ ess@@ men , journalists who are suspected of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no break @-@ break from violence , and while throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses are frequent as at least 25 , since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to took office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are standing after attacks and threats , and until now there was at least seven deaths in seven countries .
among the latter is their editors and their inspiration from Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
its absence will be felt deep , although its presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez presented its mid@@ finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; on the facade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building . two re@@ porter in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts , who show his smiling face with glasses or its typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ por@@ ters are discussing about their shared issues , the trau@@ ma , its night@@ mar@@ es , ins@@ om@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although in 2010 a special law office was er@@ ected to process the cases of journalists , this according to the committee in the protection of journalists has passed only two criminal proceedings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as with most thousands of mur@@ ders who are linked each year with drug @-@ commerce and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely put in court .
at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are un@@ com@@ for@@ ting and even though the terrain is still ver@@ rä@@ ter@@ ous .
without information on the mur@@ der@@ ers without justice , the meeting has little benefits to discussing the security , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very sil@@ ly to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we do not know the Why b@@ ust we all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the capital city of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he only made it a few blocks away before the red Toyota Cor@@ ol@@ la was raised by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , pres@@ um@@ ably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated into the &quot; Zw@@ öl@@ fter River . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it close .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adults .
rum@@ ours tend to fly freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans re@@ mun@@ eration last year and the delivery into the United States in January was Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the blo@@ o@@ dies@@ t batt@@ ps of the country , as ri@@ val groups fight here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day one or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery full is full of two @-@ story mouse @-@ zones for drug @-@ ents that are bigger than many houses for the living .
forget about a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; if only a Kart@@ ell has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez has been aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Boj@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , with the blame that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
first in February the publication of a interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val@@ ed anti @-@ fr@@ actions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans S@@ ons .
this publication may refuse the sons , suspected gang@@ sters bought every copy of the issue once they were delivered to time limits .
the second fault was that Val@@ dez are not forced to force , after the conf@@ isc@@ ation of a different newspaper , the same story had been released to leave the country to its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his k@@ ill@@ ings is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues ann@@ ed that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined with five colleagues to establish Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without reaching a d@@ ow@@ ry problem , &quot; said Bu@@ o@@ qu@@ ez .
with the time the newspaper has earned a reputation because of cour@@ ageous and honest coverage , and revenues and advertising .
re@@ porter loved , harsh investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were cap@@ tiv@@ ated by a publication in which they could read stories , who no one could deal with .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Prize &quot; for their reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez presented the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history , wherever they lead .
he gave himself to him that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of CP@@ J award .
drugs in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV in October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to take over the task that you as a journalist sign , either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in view of so many still@@ birth ... why did you not say what was going ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce @-@ Team miss Val@@ dez , the Spa@@ ing@@ bird , who was like a harbour worker , the friend who generous with hu@@ gs and advice was , a teacher that knew how to survive .
you trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .
now ask them , was his love for the routine ?
his death has also forced them to question their own assump@@ tions about how they best do their job and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their fur@@ tive start and run@@ ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bu@@ o@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ maintenance .
to trust his own inst@@ inct .
when it smells , stay away .
the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; smell a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing with Javier has happened . &quot;
the ancient rules , like he and others say in Sin@@ alo@@ a no longer - just as in Tam@@ ar@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government agencies at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for safety training , suddenly there were no phones . days earlier , Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
they sear@@ ched for two polic@@ emen protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ short building in a mid @-@ class district of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the Scher@@ z , some of the re@@ por@@ ters asked if these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen , the govern@@ or themselves were not trusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is months ago since the re@@ por@@ ters have gone into the Ber@@ gl@@ and@@ s , where the drug database is de facto under control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the output of this week ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has co@@ cked on three main stories .
there was the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the Bru@@ ders of the former known box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an Ex@@ pos@@ é about the government spending , focused on the hom@@ etown of the Gover@@ nor .
and there was one group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block away from the office of the National Assembly .
there was no official word about who was kid@@ n@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was offered when it was time to write , what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local based on drug companions and authorities .
a re@@ porter was recorded from public records that the restaurant has been registered under the name of a politician , who ruled the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) , which ruled over the whole century all political levels .
recently , several Pr@@ i @-@ Gou@@ ver@@ ne@@ ure have been accused of highly distinguished cases of corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real bat the re@@ porter to write about prec@@ eding inci@@ dents in this restaurant , including one where the son of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escap@@ ed a military attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few months before the reader had seen the Kolum@@ ne of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about ab@@ duction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we had already knew what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its sl@@ ender body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez became the storage room for signs and stick@@ ers who are protest@@ ing against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the staff have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
Rep@@ or@@ itor Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez sn@@ aps a few characters and went to a demonstration next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the state of State .
Salvador Ad@@ ams disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is his .
throughout the country journalists have become sound@@ ly stronger by written down in organised protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on hearing and construction .
on this day the director Boj@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Val@@ dez .
during a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a the day after the murder of Val@@ dez accused the authorities to sp@@ ire journalists and bring them to , because they said the truth .
she has since then asked that she is once again divided by the government because she is concerned that their obj@@ ectivity has hurt its obj@@ ectivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico organized by organised crime , involved in government officials and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; valid society &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his final book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote that re@@ porter was not only killed by drugs , but also on command of politicians and security guards talking to organised crime under a ceiling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; was assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials last year .
&quot; in Mexico you die , because they want you sne@@ ak the mouth , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez .
obviously , the murder have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ T@@ elli@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your body was signed along with a note that was supp@@ os@@ edly signed by Z@@ etas @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer tast@@ ature and ear@@ phones in addition to their separate head .
some stores have chosen to close , as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the murder of the correspon@@ dent Miros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others will continue , as there was El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo , and after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
2010 Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez addressed the drug box with a guid@@ eline on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their native states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are h@@ unted by the photographer Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay back and continue working , it is a daily dance with risk @-@ rich decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra who wanted to be the poet , gives to that the drug trading carries him frigh@@ tened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico is going to hell , and so I became re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce on the side@@ walk before the office and drank beer , when all their phones began .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with Band@@ esh@@ are and security guards close to the beach Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war has been escal@@ ated how it was promised by a series of Kart@@ ell &apos;s messages in the region .
from the board &apos;s edge , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce via mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ ens he@@ ats close to - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ ş@@ o@@ qu@@ ez thre@@ w a look at the polic@@ emen , the guard thought to see if they were in willingness .
if they were afraid they showed it not .
among the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper whose middle @-@ finger was visible for the whole Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce took its mark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you also only remember to conclude , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ o@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the same day , the intern@@ s was ass@@ ass@@ ed to send her to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to do@@ dge his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , if a sho@@ cking .
now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible Nas@@ horn of a Canadian mountain labor@@ ers were so well received that experts have described as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they could even determine that his glo@@ ve skin was by red@@ dish brown and they said they had had something of a &quot; unpleasant past . &quot;
the report published in the Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology magazine , called it as &quot; the best@@ owed din@@ osau@@ rs , who was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot;
the Fos@@ sil is a newly discovered art of N@@ od@@ osau@@ rs , which lived in the middle of the chal@@ k period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
its incredibly well @-@ rare condition has researchers who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the harvest@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ ater is the best preserved Fos@@ sil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he died on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met something of the surrounding rock l@@ acked on the place , and decided to watch more accurately .
the Fos@@ sil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy Erd@@ kl@@ ump@@ ens .
after all this hard work the finished product is now ready to be unveil@@ ed .
&quot; if you just blin@@ king a bit with the eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the chief author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the cre@@ ature is seen .
&quot; it will enter into knowledge history as one of the most beautiful and preserved din@@ osau@@ rs individuals - the mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
researchers have found that this plant @-@ e@@ aters , although it is covered with an arm@@ or and a shifting tank , probably under meat was threatened by meat .
the severe ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide themselves from prey , and used an exhau@@ st technology that is known as counter@@ parts that is also used by many modern animals .
this would allow it to mix better into its surroundings and ste@@ eping its enemies , say experts , which indicates that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old cre@@ ature from the family of the N@@ od@@ osau@@ rs was first @-@ time head@@ lines in May and can now be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bo@@ om@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the Muse@@ um@@ en@@ gene@@ ous Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours to un@@ cover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specim@@ en allowed it to enable Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of sc@@ ales and arm@@ aments over his body .
they discovered the conf@@ ession , a widespread Defense method in the animal kingdom , which means the head of cre@@ ature dar@@ ker was as their under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ sh@@ red@@ ness is common , the results are surprising , since the size of Bo@@ om@@ op@@ el@@ ta is far exce@@ eds the animals living today .
it points out that the din@@ osau@@ rs was tax@@ ed by enough pressure by the meat of the din@@ osau@@ rs , the evolution acceler@@ ated the cre@@ eping of the confrontation as means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that ap@@ point the conf@@ ession - think of roe deer , zeb@@ ras or g@@ ür@@ tel@@ als - are much smaller and vulnerable as lo@@ ot , which sign@@ aled that this N@@ od@@ osau@@ rs was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; powerful beast @-@ behavior on a massive , heavily ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs of be@@ asts have to have been , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their sc@@ ales shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r were brown .
scientists continue to investigate the animal in references about his life , including its con@@ served Dar@@ min@@ ated to find out what it had eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , driven into a river and driven into the sea , where he s@@ ank on his back to the sea .
at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as Southern Africa nowadays , and rivers and oceans are likely much more widespread than it is today .
&quot; this ne@@ od@@ osau@@ rs is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preser@@ v@@ aged skin , but also remains in three dimensions and maintains the original form of animal welfare , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks like almost as in the early cra@@ yon time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need much fantasy to use it to re@@ construct it . if you just have a little with the eyes you could almost believe he is at sleep . &quot;
the chal@@ k @-@ time was a time , as huge ther@@ op@@ ods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ r , which stood on two legs , the earth prev@@ ailed .
although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , millions of years after the Bo@@ om@@ op@@ el@@ ta lived , the ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs was h@@ unted by some of his terrible ancestors .
this belongs to the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tonnes he@@ avier monsters .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology , believe that Bo@@ om@@ op@@ el@@ ta vers@@ ank after death in the sea and rec@@ ti@@ fied in mud .
the cre@@ ature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he died on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
according to the museum it is the most preserved ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ aments , and is entirely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long points which rag@@ ed from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mo@@ red Pflanzen@@ fres@@ ser was wel@@ ded by the Western Canada until a flood@@ ed river was flood@@ ed into the open sea .
but the underwater ill@@ ation of the din@@ osau@@ riers kept his arm@@ or in an exquisite detail .
the hidden des@@ crip@@ ts of this special specim@@ en are so well preserved that the skin is still hol@@ pri@@ ght d@@ rou@@ gh@@ s along the din@@ osau@@ riers
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as rare as a profit in the lot@@ tery .
the more I check it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied rests of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y tap@@ es , which carry the skull of the beast .
his right @-@ foot is located on his side , his five fingers are split up .
I can count the Schu@@ ppen on his sole . &quot;
in the Thunder@@ storm : Mass@@ ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many last
severe accident on Thursday nights on the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass@@ aging board .
there are numerous last , kilomet@@ re St@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the Stuttgart @-@ Munich motorway ( A@@ 8 ) , there have been inju@@ red at a mass@@ aging afternoon at a massage campaign .
according to the first information of the police were against 17.00 hours between the Adel@@ z@@ hausen und O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm at almost 30 vehicles , including the trucks of trucks .
over the exact number of obj@@ ections first did not require any information .
it is a mild to mid @-@ sized injury , said a police spokes@@ person .
a big up@@ take of rescue vehicles was at the Un@@ fall@@ back site .
the A@@ 8 was completely locked in direction of Munich .
in the Munich Residenz there formed a roughly ten kilometres long dor@@ sal .
like a AZ @-@ re@@ porter reported it also came on the counter@@ track to massive disabilities - through numerous g@@ aff@@ ers .
the fire@@ brig@@ ade is not@@ ched itself the characteristic of the driver @-@ gl@@ ist who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 p.m. the second accident occurred at the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a coll@@ ision between a Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ spor@@ ter and a passenger .
a rescue @-@ helic@@ opter was on the road to the in@@ genu@@ ity .
German rail@@ ways : Group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everybody has experienced before : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or you are deep@@ ened in his work and has just an in@@ geni@@ ous thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and ar@@ ouses an uns@@ ett@@ ft , or t@@ aps the driver in the middle of the work@@ flow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cardboard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn test@@ es currently the creator function .
one simply confirms having a mobile phone that you have taken up his place and thus de@@ valu@@ ables the ticket .
currently running a test mode on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the offer , we extend it out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is expected to be available for many more remote routes in Germany next year , &quot; said a train or@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the train is called the card stand@@ ings without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to be able to use this , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - which already do most passengers already .
you have to also bought it via the app the train , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient type of ticket application .
and finally you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works so : one climb@@ s to the train , calling his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the test customer then a button for electronic de@@ valu@@ ation appears .
the pull @-@ companion on their mobile devices receive a note that the g@@ ast is located in the train and taken the ge@@ bu@@ ked seat Y .
when the tractor cr@@ amp is on place in the box , he knows that there is a passenger with already ent@@ less online @-@ ticket .
so one can continue to sleep , continue to be silent .
the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the rail@@ ways - which is to use the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to travel without ticket control through our train staff , checked in the DB browser just yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this allows the passengers to shape their travel time on the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing @-@ Board of DB Fern@@ traffic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who often drives the rail , know that besides delays and missed the tickets include the major hass@@ les .
because often you have yourself , but in any case one of the passengers are not all the documents that you need for the de@@ valu@@ ation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the recruitment process or otherwise a document that must be as@@ sign .
the consequence are endless discussions between Zug@@ vor@@ s and rides , which leads to bad mood in the section or large space and delays in control of your own tickets and the creator at the end the time takes care of other concerns .
only a small number of test@@ ers will use the new service .
and that also applies to the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other train numbers on the same track are not activated .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Brit@@ t@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken to its core .
only one day after being arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis @-@ born on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b flat that rented them and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone .
you stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the high school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has just killed a 18 @-@ year child , and it still lies on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , as nobody else had posted on their feed , she completed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly saved at their tim@@ eline ret@@ we@@ et@@ et .
the rap@@ per from the territory of St. Louis was part of the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed live live .
he post@@ ete a picture of Brow@@ n@@ able body that was stretched out on the street and stay there four hours .
&quot; that is wild , &quot; thought Fer@@ rell at himself .
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she put her cell phone to return later in the evening to return to Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of the police band and people who cri@@ ed , and by a man who claimed to be his father who carried a sign with the wording : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live Fe@@ ed , where a polic@@ eman had a group of protest@@ ers with a bell@@ ish dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , a different polic@@ eman is his gun and cr@@ ying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... be@@ asts all &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ alled Fer@@ rell in their statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder that we have got used to ourselves and which we can name typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this moment I felt sho@@ oters .
I was angry and we@@ pt . &quot;
they booked a flight back and went home the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock they took her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; , in the cin@@ emas starting from the 11 .
it is a history of survival and Protest@@ ant , of love and loss , strength and resistance , which arises from the point of view of the human being who live in community and have filled the streets to challenge answers .
as Fer@@ rell , with her daughter who carried a flower gar@@ ment and a suitable crown , to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two talking about a conversation , which she had countless times before this morning , &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how long I have taught you how black people have to fight for you what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remember what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police had a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take her , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later .
&quot; what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
you have to know and see it and be raised in it .
it has to be well developed , not only acti@@ vis@@ m and organization , but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to be free to free ourselves .
even though I have the luck to give her an experience in which she does not experience an e@@ kl@@ at@@ ant racism , it is no different from the next black ladies child .
I have the feeling , I would prove her a bad service to keep them away . &quot;
the first stop when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authorities that was transferred to a camping area than the activists are awaiting the possible non @-@ indic@@ t@@ ment by Officer of Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined together with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared hand@@ bags before and helped , pass them on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly started to take a new type of acti@@ vis@@ m for Fer@@ rell .
&quot; my acti@@ vis@@ m changed after the 9th of August , &quot; she said and not@@ ices that she was a student at the University of Miss@@ ouri @-@ St. Louis President in the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it is all come . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met in an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ director of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar just wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there came to a question of Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ tic@@ ism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of men , often of wh@@ ites - in a community which prof@@ ited by their pain and their resi@@ li@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like Fol@@ ay@@ an recently explained in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and who have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then Co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field , known for his acti@@ vis@@ m around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt .
his commitment brought together Fer@@ rell the project closer , together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after browsers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaking with us . we speak , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people will be represented , because I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on skill experience - to show that this movement is not about an Messi@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the open participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consequently , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls &apos;s life as she mar@@ ries and mar@@ ries their wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and for the human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ s history repeated history plays the role of black gay women in the broader black @-@ color movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as sw@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
black , gay women must bear the main load of everything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agre@@ es to remark that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , they insist that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a affir@@ mati@@ al type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rell was chosen as a heart of film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the person who sho@@ ok this energy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no coincidence , even though it was at the fore@@ front , because with a life on these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel your energy by the screen . &quot;
in the meantime , the messages for F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the municipality and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is on operation for 2 ½ years because of the block@@ ade of a highway in a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it describes the soci@@ opolit@@ ical atmosphere of the area that it calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a m@@ ess . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless they cl@@ oned to a song and she feels committed to this memory , since she went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; Siz@@ ing &quot; : TV reader discuss about bit @-@ gallery
the bit @-@ gallery travels the people , although they have not been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south of the pedestrian prec@@ inct , divi@@ des the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents since the first presentation of 2009 .
cold leaves the topic hardly any .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while the one at the bit @-@ gallery say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This would be genuine class &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Sc@@ ene ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not need a man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ ags ) or quite simple : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; size w@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Scholz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the advoc@@ ates insist that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , from which the rest of the business will benefit , the opponents don &apos;t worry that then the pedestrian prec@@ inct .
in addition , the gallery will be exactly planned on the property , on which the far@@ th@@ market stands , in the 13 direct stock market offers its products .
with the start of construction work , it will be possible .
the Galerie @-@ M@@ acher want to integrate a mark@@ eth@@ in in the new building - and a place with possibility of sitting outside sitting .
Simone Room : &quot; we have been buying almost every week in the farm market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake of the farm always happy to be very happy .
also , the but@@ cher , we have discovered for us .
we would like to see that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities is that too .
mainly the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ensing : &quot; whether lec@@ turer in a market hall in the gallery arrives at the level of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but most likely not just be low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what shopping m@@ ist in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find it su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is already enough of these in our city .
you see how many stores are empty here - some have been here for months and years .
but since there is not even a weekly market , it &apos;s all the more important that left us at least the market hall .
for all , the goods offered there is fresh , is mostly available directly from the producer and is ob@@ endless .
as you can see , counter @-@ shops in a shopping center is available only from larger companies because the dor@@ ms are often not portable for a retail@@ er .
too bad , specialty shops is almost no longer and that which is still left , will probably also disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a mall with a market hall is not suitable for me .
and the gallery does not fit in accordance with Bit@@ burg .
most importantly : where is the farmers market hall during the construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit @-@ gallery is actually coming .
or do you already manage the g@@ f @-@ gallery before , all business from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it simply does not work .
and a shopping center , that is empty also needs no one .
in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery .
but for a peasant mark@@ ings , it is thanks to the W@@ ahn@@ wei@@ rd many - as I find - sensu@@ ous construction projects in Bit@@ burg no place anymore .
when the peasant hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
an appropriate simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits of Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces - white , black and brown , which are almost invisible - that hang on the cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and hair cuts that you were sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison of Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence analy@@ st was holding a 35 @-@ year old sentence , following the diplomatic news on the website Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
the new exhibition , which opened on August 2nd , is called A Bec@@ oming of blan@@ ce ( An appropriate simil@@ arity ) .
it is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline is united in technology , computer sciences and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ wife and landmark dis@@ assembly , whose conviction of Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days in his post .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ m analysis of DNA that could be created by Mann@@ ing and how someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look like anyone with these gen@@ om@@ ous data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the in@@ dur@@ ated determin@@ ations of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also to identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already been talking about the identification as a woman since its pu@@ ber@@ ty was condemned 2013 because of 20 accus@@ ations , among them six cl@@ ashes against the es@@ pi@@ on@@ es@@ etz , computer was and theft .
through the prison her image was supp@@ ressed so much that there was only a single photo - a gr@@ acious , black @-@ white self @-@ wh@@ ie , sitting in the Mann@@ ing obviously uncomfortable on a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ in@@ bl@@ onde per@@ ong is carrying - with which it was associated .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of their 2012 @-@ project &apos; stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
in this , the artist &apos;s portra@@ iture produced from stran@@ ger of for@@ ensi@@ c art@@ ef@@ acts like cigar@@ ettes and ch@@ ew@@ ing g@@ um , adding the DNA from the waste to produce an image how these people might look like .
that was the time when it received an e @-@ mail from a magazin ag@@ azine .
&quot; they were an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; stated De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press show of the new exhibition .
and she could not visit this time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so they took contact with Chelsea , and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her det@@ ain@@ ees M@@ use were added to the same bri@@ eff@@ ici@@ ents that have inter@@ change@@ ed several letters over the course of two years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they called even one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ un@@ o Illu@@ stri@@ erte &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ly Image &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who fores@@ aw a future in which the president would kill Chel@@ ating judgment and it would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
fact that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing liberation after seven brutal years had been calling in a military j@@ unta in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome type of happ@@ ier meeting .
there is now at the opening of the exhibition a somewhat deep and Star@@ ke , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads to war against in@@ forman@@ t from the governmental camp and against trans@@ gender @-@ troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ ened ways in order to def@@ ends the rigi@@ d divisions , which he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been asked for the strange Tim@@ ing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a given reason . &quot;
in one on the wall of the Gallery depic@@ ted artistic statement called Mann@@ ing with its over@@ sized sub@@ ordin@@ ating among them ( the &quot; i &quot; in their family name , attached with a heart ) an end to &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , the basis of gender , race , sexuality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thousands of C@@ s and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed , through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or Nu@@ kle@@ oti@@ de after the highly developed scientific lex@@ icon of the artist ) to show how amazing similarly , at least in biological sense , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully join us is that our gen@@ ome does not take care of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video @-@ work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also visible .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in an own room is a page from above mentioned Com@@ ic No@@ vel@@ le .
she shows Mann@@ ing as they emerg@@ es with a free @-@ pre@@ diction in the hand from the disciplines in the United States as King @-@ Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they talk to your talk , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came straight from a letter that she wrote me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who greet them from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get ge@@ os@@ sing when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it meant to be fores@@ een in the com@@ ic book - but when they were supposed to do it , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room from the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ators , who are related to hor@@ des of Protest@@ ants .
that was also purpos@@ eful how everything in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , where their genetic ap@@ ple@@ t were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had it on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that shaped with Chelsea , like the movement that hid behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and a employee of the University of Oxford because of killing
a nation@@ wide common hunting is in progress for a professor at North@@ western University and a staff of the University of Oxford , which was chosen as susp@@ ects , having received a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries .
on Monday we were exhibited for Wyn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) Ar@@ rest warran@@ t because of murder because of her alle@@ ged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the minist@@ ries of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several stit@@ ches died .
a by the police authorities of Chicago rep@@ ent war@@ fare system states that the cor@@ pse has been discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injury to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead at the place of action for dead , and det@@ ective exam@@ ining the st@@ ony as murder , while the police is actively seeking to the two susp@@ ects , officials said .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now an abstract matter which is being investigated by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University cooperate with this investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help the U.S. government agencies to any concei@@ vable way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement pointed out that war@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want he himself .
Chief Communications Officer of the Police agency of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he urge the susp@@ ects im@@ pressing the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has an idea of their place of residence and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building ste@@ ward of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a pu@@ zz@@ ling tip that said in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as a very cru@@ el .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27th .
it has been confirmed by safety cameras that la@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents : &quot; the police are currently working at the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explo@@ res a variety of mot@@ if@@ s , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the W@@ ada roadmap in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian vic@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
the Russian vic@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t be long before the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ ADA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap , R@@ US@@ ADA has received the right to plan and test it in collaboration with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the W@@ ada @-@ roadmap was updated in this respect , &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM em@@ itted the second part of the roadmap of the W@@ ada to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for re@@ integration of R@@ US@@ ADA and recently published on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko he does not contain anything that could concern for Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) and the W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , one of the criteria named in the list are stated that the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping authorities have reported the reported results of the W@@ ada approved investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to publicly accept actors in the Russian sport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to the matter Mut@@ ko : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we conduct the study because our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has got an error . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programs and we will not admit that which does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ kos words tun@@ ed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with Russian sales point R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report has controversial positions and regulations .
nobody has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; says Sm@@ ir@@ nov .
R@@ US@@ ADA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the D@@ oping @-@ Sk@@ and@@ als from the W@@ ada of the realisation of D@@ op@@ ing@@ controlled in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ d@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the main arti@@ ers of the organization in Moscow in July W@@ ada @-@ General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ US@@ ADA moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; moving to be used again .

the start @-@ ups that will help your business not to be transferred to the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the pol@@ ls doesn &apos;t .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ously .
and even if you promised an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers were not gri@@ ev@@ ing the process .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Gesellschaft Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
it brought people out of the outside by assistance .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at the gu@@ ing to help companies figure out how their employees feel .
by creating and licens@@ ing software , which allows the specific purpose of measuring the employee &apos;s commitment , it allows companies to address topics , specific groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wer@@ n allow to get the C @-@ suite managers and address directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ Bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools used by companies to measure staff dedication .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers an heat card of the company that shows which units have most complaints and which managers may have low nutritional results - so that you can drill in@@ duced why .
companies come to make sure that at the head of the workplace culture will have to stay , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in Sk@@ and@@ als since then a former employee has published a blog post , which has spoken an environment of rewards in those who have spoken , pun@@ ished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have 2020 more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion value , according to the finan@@ z@@ technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize behavior , seeing a rising interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently signed itself as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent companies send custom @-@ tailored &quot; puls@@ ation &quot; pol@@ ls , confi@@ d@@ ently collect confidential answers in real time and watch the heat @-@ cards of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , with which employees can report their behavior .
and if the main business is involved , complaints go directly to the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of public opinion has sei@@ zed the Reg@@ ulators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that his staff is badly treated or beha@@ ved imm@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience precious consequences due to consumers @-@ boy@@ cot@@ t , worker @-@ flu@@ ids and cl@@ oning , quin@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , Conver@@ cent more than one year used to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
sooner if a employee wanted to report a problem he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company central , a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .
it was often a inti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , James W@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good opportunity to pursue the complaints from employees .
well , since the company manages Conver@@ cent , issues that were previously hidden from managers who were hiding in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ as@@ sment or in@@ consistent practic@@ es@@ - faster and addressed .
&quot; I can move closer to this holistic , 360 degree perspective in the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who dire@@ cts the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders before employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to re@@ ap ethics , values and employees in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed for ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Quin@@ lan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it lasted until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Media to their right came , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before using technology for monitoring the ethics , men used more hope than a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent provide your software as a service and load the company with recur@@ ring fees for use of their products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a business model and a chance that the consent of Venture Capital investors will find , both start @-@ ups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sap@@ ph@@ ire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital that has raised the entire capital to $ 47 million .
gem@@ s secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought up his entire financing to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , in view of the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex in research which shows that today &apos;s employees expect more jobs than before .
competitive markets like Sili@@ con Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only bet@@ s .
the staff want to have the feeling that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are glad to be at a company that their voices are heard and that the work that you do is worth doing , then feel stronger commitment to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience with Linked@@ In , which is used both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors are reaching he@@ iss if their portfolio companies are well running . company running well if employees are committed and engaged .
if the Analytics tools of third parties promise , commitment and commitment of employees , it &apos;s no wonder that you will find support .
the data about the employee &apos;s work is important according to the experts of the workplace culture .
but the data are useless if the administrator of a firm is not taking action .
in fact , if a company asks employees after your feedback , it may have an expectation that changes is on the way .
and if change is not fast enough , or not at all , it may motiv@@ ate those frustr@@ ations and employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , the company has left to rely on the collecting of data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because if you do not follow the staff , you really have heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
take care of it ?
and who do not care about why should I ? &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed which now leads monthly workers surveys , was able to initi@@ ate action on the same day if a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organise and add several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .
in Ruby Tuesday , the company gets more and more insights about the staff , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better bond of workers in a industry that is known for high sales .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose man , you also lose customers .
and if you lose customer then you will lose company .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ days practices and makes a long day for the break
it is about 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA Foot@@ ball@@ ers are talking on one side of the new practice fields of the team on campus .
some have moved their tri@@ bal parts and show the back full of swe@@ at from the first day of the rehear@@ sals .
for a good part of the team , these three @-@ day minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are written to the summer courses are returning after the three @-@ hour exercise to return to their final examination , before they return the next morning at 6 : 30 pm to the Aqu@@ man Football Center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real tre@@ t@@ mill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said wa@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday to Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ days exercises to facilitate the burden of players , and it has extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three trainings from the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 pm , in order to meet the already completed sched@@ ules of the players .
the compromise reached from the two days is more than a day when the break at the beginning of the camp was postpon@@ ed almost one week after the last season and during the summer time Mor@@ as six games times were conducted in West@@ wood &apos;s practical exercises .
they should ab@@ ide in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 in front of the formal game preparations for their pre@@ l@@ ude against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he support the rule modification of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add the multi @-@ busy routes of players to add another point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous burden on three or four days to them , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just have crossed , they will keep on , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it &apos;s really great . &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , what has been covered by the clear sight@@ se@@ w of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class , which has already been subjected to foot@@ b@@ ings , which is a protective grid behind a tor@@ rent pillar , no easy task will be .
break @-@ players should occupy the hotel starting this weekend , but Mor@@ a dre@@ amed that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem and it &apos;s not far from thinking that people stay there for a room and then set up a practice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video of a exercise , it is a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces here and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that is why I don &apos;t worry too much about it .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook aims to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with di@@ amet@@ ers to fact aud@@ ited by third parties and show their results in the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it &apos;s one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake News .
the company said in an opinion on its website that will start using updated machine teaching methods to identify possible fe@@ ed@@ backs , and send them to fact test , which may display the results of the actual test from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the leading f@@ ake points for so @-@ called F@@ ake news , many of whom believe they have also influenced the US presidential elections .
the problem has become a major political issue in Europe , whereas the French voters were flood@@ ed in advance of the presidential elections in May with false stories , and Germany should be pun@@ ished in advance after social media networks , if they fail to eliminate in@@ und@@ am@@ filled post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate explanation in German , that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany will start a test of the new facts review .
&quot; besides the knowledge , which stories of the fac@@ tor@@ ate third parties are challenged , people want more context in order to make up @-@ made decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , Produ@@ cer for Facebook news in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Connection article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and works on other changes to his news fe@@ eds to reduce wrong news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a com@@ ic @-@ Romans : a castle in the History of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a Squ@@ ee@@ ze Music video and was a si@@ ze@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ r years .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its cozy seat in Be@@ w@@ l River valley in K@@ ent and is now for inspiration for a graphical novel of Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ i@@ red Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the manuscript of someone , who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says aw@@ ful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; embr@@ aced the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , emerging British artist - Isaac Bar@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos;s Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected emotional .
&quot; I have only re@@ acted to the thum@@ bs on the side of a letter that was written by a double @-@ ag@@ enten in the 1700 &apos;s years , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; this is its durability !
and letters always cra@@ w@@ l after smoke , for then one sin@@ ks a fire because of the light .
for someone who lives up to 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself were also .
Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
for someone who so with old pap@@ er@@ ate is be@@ aten , that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England ( &quot; To be honest : I have seen my welcome gru@@ ity , &quot; ) it seems all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vietnamese &quot; new &quot; castle to study the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ os@@ ities of the castle , such as the mon@@ ed an@@ chor@@ ages on the walls and the bottles spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he emig@@ rated through the terrain and ruins of ancient castle , and spoke with land@@ owners , gar@@ dener , and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he drank &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust was not received full access as the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des a decade later arrived , employees had just begun to take care of the archive that he said as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ ocr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , wir@@ ing it on the loft .
Tag@@ eb@@ ücher , letters from the time of English em@@ pi@@ res , cards which represent what poss@@ essed : &quot; you could mean that land fli@@ ck@@ oned boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a pe@@ ar fighting for the two families .
guys , let everything go his way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive on a wider base in the British history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who follows a man who built the newly built castle , to join the farm itself from 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record from a tur@@ mo@@ il that entered into the castle 13@@ 80 in the castle in this book with the title &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des .
&quot; the peasant arose in this area and I thought a revol@@ t was a good beginning .
maybe the two inter@@ connects to each other ? &quot;
other stories are rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jes@@ uit@@ en@@ pat@@ ers who hid the family of Dar@@ rell seven years during the English Re@@ formation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , represented by the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell , who filled his own bu@@ rial , by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was only made years later when its coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the intest@@ ines are rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; men &apos;s seemed to be quite a cro@@ oks to get back debt and spend money on things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men cle@@ ann@@ ed their debt cr@@ atic by increasing old women - I imagine it as a he@@ ap good @-@ looking guys before , with a talent to advertise brass . &quot;
after the end of his en@@ rol@@ ment in the castle Rho@@ des is looking for another unique s@@ ay@@ ment experiences .
he has taken a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic @-@ novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the terrain of a san@@ atori@@ ums from the early 20th century , which has since been restored by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go again , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to come back with the dam@@ n life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the envel@@ oping of the 301 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef on Friday has started their campaign to introduce a new umbrella @-@ brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) .
until Thursday Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team will keep secret to Nelson Art@@ z .
at the end of August it was said to be the peak of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too nice for us .
or ? , &quot; ask the creators of the promotion since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel .
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their yesterday online Website .
&quot; but we take advantage of this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some of them is better than it seems .
basically , we strongly believe that we as the Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens know all about the beauty and at@@ tr@@ activ@@ eness of our city very well . &quot;
in the action it is more than &quot; just &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says furthermore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said to form@@ ulate a single @-@ based promise , one that the city gives an un@@ mistak@@ able all @-@ one character . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities .
a moderate five @-@ dig@@ it amount will be the town of Bad Honnef its new umbrella @-@ brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s afraid of the army
each year in early August advis@@ es in Ankara of the Upper Military Council ( Y@@ as ) on Pen@@ sion@@ ers and evalu@@ ations in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
the session was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the residence of the Prime Minister .
at the advisory board , under the presidency of the Government , the five vice @-@ president as well as the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
these were the civilians in the Y@@ as in the crossing .
the Government draws the re@@ ins in the military .
the General Staff of Hul@@ usi is true in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air forces and the nav@@ y were de@@ duc@@ ted .
since the failed Cou@@ p , State of Erd@@ og@@ an has fallen by 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of an alle@@ ged connections to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , Erd@@ og@@ an as a wi@@ z@@ ard of the coup .
against 4@@ 86 people participating in the coup attempt to be involved in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erd@@ og@@ an had been referred to as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divine gift , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to fully clean the Ar@@ med Forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but has Erd@@ og@@ an really standing on the army ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; late February the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ beh@@ agen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the military office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the general board , there are concerns over an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , who , among other things , would be manifest@@ ed for Sol@@ dat@@ within , wrote the newspaper .
the large @-@ pur@@ se in the army and security guards goes on .
in the middle of July Erd@@ og@@ an per decre@@ e further 73@@ 95 nationalities , including 23@@ 03 Pol@@ ishing and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed that Erd@@ og@@ an saw the military in Erd@@ og@@ an .
the gener@@ als created earlier than the real masters of the country .
three times they put on appeal to their role as a gu@@ ardian of sec@@ ular state order .
after his election victory , Erd@@ og@@ an urged the power of the military &apos;s step back , not least on appeal to the reforms of the European Union .
former officers say Erd@@ og@@ an t@@ rei@@ be targeted a Islam@@ ization of the Ar@@ med Forces .
in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; an un@@ named officers who sought after the coup attempt out of fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extrem@@ ists in a few years &quot; full of extrem@@ ists and Sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
affects this , such development could not be cold .
anyway , in the alliance after the pur@@ se , there are doubts about the willingness of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management structures and oper@@ ability abilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says N@@ ato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for Green Card
there will be a new US immig@@ rant plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
he sees to reduce the legal immigrants to 5@@ 0,000 a year , more str@@ ingent regulations for issu@@ ing visa for a temporary working permit , and limitations for families @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and is supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by changing the way citizens from other countries of Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will come to the candidates who speak English who have the funds to support themselves and show knowledge that our economy will come to good , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media .
Ministry wants to provide circuit for racing ,
over the past months the past few months has been disp@@ uted about the future of the race cr@@ utt@@ les - now it should be very fast .
even before the end of the year , the route is said to be built on which the tourist path goes , built .
in order to secure the future of the race in the long term , according to the transport of the Ministry of Transport , this year will begin to work on the route .
&quot; with the decision to further order and san@@ ction the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country belongs to this especially for tourism important connection , &quot; said Traffic secret@@ ary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt .
the costs for the maintenance of the route was at about 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country over@@ take 75 percent .
the contract , on whose basis the shuttle will also be ordered in the future of the country , I am going to be finally adapted , stated S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen train as a carrier are already agreed upon the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the roadmap to use the vehicles and quality standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of 11 years .
thus , the racing stei@@ g @-@ shuttle will be ordered on December 2017 .
the racing stei@@ g @-@ shuttle is an especially popular railway link between railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
in the course of a pilot business over the past few months , the circuit has been used by sufficient many people to keep them regular in the future .
the track is also in parts strongly pool@@ ed .
the rise of Sex @-@ robot is real and we should worry
just as you thought it cannot be any crazy this year , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a great thing .
recently published the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we have to start to take their Ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye colour of the robot , its form of ni@@ pple , and the type of F@@ ing@@ ern@@ ag@@ el .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make themselves funny , but the companies deliver a lot more often and we will see them much more frequent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key in the release of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern Sex@@ X@@ lips have developed from its inflatable partners to robots with a Sili@@ cone fores@@ kin which feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved through artificial intelligence .
the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs , &quot; and select everything from the eye of the robot to the form of the ni@@ p@@ ples , until the type or colour of his fingers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes more wor@@ rying because many robots had the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities who would like a step@@ ford @-@ wife progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern Sex@@ X@@ lips have developed to robots with a si@@ lic@@ on skin .
the Real@@ T@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example to custom@@ ize its users to adapt their robots to the qualities they appe@@ aling , such as rel@@ ap@@ ing .
and then there is still the True Compan@@ ion developed Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robots with pre @-@ programm@@ ed personalities as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of pu@@ pi@@ ke and &quot; Wild Wendy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ uro@@ us &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality to be adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ ze the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so may they like what you like , and she does not like what you like , etc .
during the day she also has her m@@ oods - quite like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; it can be tired , be fixed on conversation or it can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many troub@@ ling aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the inter@@ pret@@ ti@@ ous female properties , when one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : res@@ ump@@ y ) Far@@ rah is going on most .
on his website com@@ promised True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a VI@@ BRA@@ TOR , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a VI@@ BRA@@ TOR , why do men then don &apos;t have a Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it says on the website .
however , these sex robots are not only a fet@@ ish or just a different sex toy .
their origin and increasing refin@@ ement point to something dar@@ ker and lo@@ wering in our culture to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with sub@@ ju@@ g@@ ation as an optional addition .
most men will of course keep no sex robots , and while the FR@@ R re@@ marked its rising popularity , they still stay pro@@ visional on the edge of consumption .
but what comes out of the edge @-@ zones , can be in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live , very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not strange , or insul@@ ting , until they the free market gives them permission .
there is however some exagger@@ ation that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House that has spar@@ ed women to be sexually attacked .
the ab@@ omin@@ ous aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the dev@@ oured body and the engra@@ ved eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots consists in creating a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star @-@ propor@@ tions ) .
their buil@@ ders want them to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , to the point when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you cannot separate or walk away from her companion .
they have no placement or a background history , nothing , which could hin@@ der on independence or anything , which could inter@@ f@@ ere the fantasy of total submission .
in other words , they are counter@@ f@@ eit slaves .
or to express it in the phrase of 2017 : maid
m@@ umps great achievement ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of a healthy man .
it has become a binder of Tr@@ ump era that pol@@ ishing the political divisions , which have pol@@ ari@@ zed the U.S. voters , also families in small format .
around Christmas and harvest feast , there were in the US newspapers with advice about how to deal with hor@@ ror of Tr@@ ump relative .
we all alle@@ ged@@ ly supp@@ os@@ edly put us all supp@@ os@@ edly for our fil@@ tering .
less noticed is the power of m@@ umps , families to come together .
I mention this , because my c@@ ous@@ in , a left @-@ aligned poet , who lives in Chicago and has long worked with the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in our family , who visited this week in New York .
it reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the Republi@@ can relationship with which she had fought for decades because of the politics , suddenly and quite peculi@@ ar at the same side .
to the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it falls me in another connection that this also involves significant risks .
the left was strengthened by tr@@ ump but the int@@ ending effect of his presidency has the power to push us all towards right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Tr@@ ump we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that we cannot prevent us from one day to another day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is a still frigh@@ tening long scenario in which tr@@ ump Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which suddenly appears in comparison with its standards as a term of denial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I find myself today of an active no@@ stal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ com@@ ic version of the re@@ sig@@ nation - the dog on the Auto@@ d@@ ach , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return notice ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact occur one to be very mild off@@ ences .
if Tr@@ ump is to be the next candidate of the Republi@@ can only be spiritu@@ ally healthy in order to qualify as an imm@@ eas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ous@@ ins in the city was , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the biggest of the Kar@@ uss@@ ells of New York Park@@ department , and the best three dollars , which one can spend in the city , if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all cl@@ owns are k@@ icking and the animals are revol@@ ve in order to look with fear about their own shoulders - extremely fin@@ sters and the cli@@ cked music is convey@@ ed this in significant way .
so many Kl@@ isch@@ ees of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines are becoming familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
twenty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not quite happy about the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the themes e@@ Pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in northern London .
but the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange experience , since two two year old , a 11 year @-@ old and two women can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have been able to evaluate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked him afterwards .
on the other hand , I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before taking my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to complete the rating with a 15 % grat@@ u@@ ity - this to buy something about the shop .
this leads not only to a slow@@ ing of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ting pressure on the server to a personality in a situation where no need is required .
the poor woman in the department store were ap@@ ologi@@ zing while I tired the experience to rich my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us exp@@ ands a hospital from prison to hospital
pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
last year he was transferred to the hospital for the treatment of cuts in his hands , which he suffered the prison authorities according to one case in his cell .
pist@@ ori@@ us was condemned for a first nec@@ kl@@ ash to a appeal of prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he k@@ issed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of the Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by putting them into her house several times by a door of toil@@ et@@ ries in his house in Pre@@ toria .
pist@@ ori@@ us said that he held his girlfriend for a stub@@ born intru@@ der , who hid herself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year det@@ ention of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say she is too thought@@ ful .
the National Criminal Law has said that they will be entitled to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the obj@@ ection could be heard this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pist@@ ori@@ us is risk that its punishment is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .

the Eagle stands for the integration , said school manager Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
the young is quite different from the other young animals ( ch@@ icks ) , but belonging to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
they wish every four @-@ t@@ äs@@ s@@ ler that he feels accepted in his new school .
it followed with instruc@@ ting to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who over again and again in teaching materials , and the parent &apos;s representatives .

software update for diesel cars : what you need to know now
how exactly is the software update held ?
must diesel @-@ drivers have to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
at the diesel summit BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group software updates are offered for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars .
you are supposed to improve the waste @-@ behavior of cars of the emissions rate Euro 5 and in part Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are exemp@@ t .
Anja S@@ met@@ anine from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives in@@ estim@@ ations :
is the new action to be compul@@ sory ?
no , the handled software updates are optional .
&quot; the binding updates previously apply only to vehicles , the Schum@@ ann software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anine .
its retro@@ fit has arranged the Kraft@@ werk @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the makers have announced a rapid implementation in the coming months , but still no precise appointment is mentioned .
Daimler has informed about every person concerned .
if anyway a inspection is sus@@ cep@@ tible , it shall be done within their frame .
how long should the equipment be drawn up ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anine .
the relationships from the commitment of the manufacturer as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen , voluntarily , the car manufacturers do not act on the subject of environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long will the update do ?
the equipment itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be to get an appointment .
what are drivers who do not drive car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE is for departure .
pres@@ um@@ ably would foreign manufacturers would re@@ draw , so S@@ met@@ anine .
now , a massive price @-@ case of Euro @-@ 4 @-@ cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but even in the regions where driving b@@ ans thre@@ aten .
in rural areas there is so far no value for older diesel .

we make the city liv@@ able
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , continues in the coming year in pensions .
the location is already written - suitable applic@@ ants are rare .
for 31 years the W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work is still great fun as he con@@ veys the pressing process .
he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his successor .
at the same time wonder@@ ed that so far no application will fulfill the application profile .
the city is searching for an architect or building engineer at the next time .
in consideration of the regular notice period - there will be enough time for a review .
da Has@@ lach acts for the administrative community as sub @-@ law office , the applic@@ ants have to as@@ sign appropriate sections .
because this function wants to keep the city definitely .
would they no longer be able to fill them out , would have to drive citizens to advice up to Off@@ enburg .
but civil proximity is the city and himself important , says W@@ acker , who reported by a good business li@@ ma as well as good mood between authority and citizens .
for more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accum@@ ulated , looking back to the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , it is safe over the building team and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects on the agenda : the transform@@ ations of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ park@@ platz .
the Kin@@ zig@@ brücke between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium is still subject matter .
the latter alone is to build around 1.5 million euros with around 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we are doing it right , &quot; says W@@ acker .
&quot; all in all waiting great tasks to my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
conf@@ lic@@ able was available for a Stadt@@ bau@@ mb@@ master of great game room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own construction and gar@@ dener can be quite flexible to react .
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the founders are often praised by citizens and visitors .
since the old town stands as ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye for that which means &quot; when new@@ buildings are to be approved , stresses the depart@@ ing Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister is a high responsibility .
he is builder , &quot; in the end everything goes here about my table . &quot;
in supporting and coordination , he can count on many years of employees : Markus Neu@@ maier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been in doing for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( woo@@ dy ) have been around for 15 years .
also that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wishes him : &quot; we are looking for someone who really would really identify and stay with the place . &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good company , but also for the further development of the city .
anyone who wants to inher@@ it the city of Has@@ lach a closed study as a Dipl@@ omin@@ genie@@ ur or Bachelor with Fach@@ richtung Archit@@ ects and have a great knowledge in the fields of construction and construction law .
the municipal office under@@ lined high @-@ construction and low @-@ construction , construction planning , gr@@ unt@@ wer@@ g@@ um , administration of municipal co@@ de@@ cks , municipal Author@@ ities and Stadt@@ g@@ ärt@@ ner@@ ei , as well as sub@@ sist@@ ence authority , including monument protection .
bicycle on lines from the south @-@ track locked
according to police the so far unknown w@@ ron@@ g@@ do@@ ers had the blue bike from the railway railway crossing in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the cables .
these were per@@ sever@@ ely damaged , that the her@@ on freight train had to be hal@@ ted .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpet@@ rators and look for them since the night @-@ time .
near the Tat@@ ort , a ros@@ ar@@ oter shut@@ ters and a bike riders have been observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ ben@@ stre@@ ich &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch at the APA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the or the perpet@@ rators would have brought themselves into great danger and also je@@ op@@ ar@@ ating the train traffic .
apart from the damage to the L@@ ok and the system , as well as the bel@@ ated traffic , and the costs of rail traffic can also be sent to the offen@@ ders by rail customers .
overall was of a &quot; substantial &quot; amount to go , the speaker said .
the damage was re@@ medi@@ ed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south @-@ track was managed without disabled people .
almost ten people were Friday afternoon , two of them concerned the transportation .
freight trains do not exist , but they had a delay .
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced about 200 metres above .
insul@@ ators and poles have also been damaged .
rot@@ es meats , dairy products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( inflammation ) to re@@ lie@@ ve
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digest@@ ive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study maintains exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could re@@ lie@@ ve the symptoms of patients with inflammat@@ ory diseases .
the incur@@ able state which affects some 1.3 million and in the UK 300@@ ,000 , creates gast@@ ric powers and ble@@ eding , recur@@ rent or bloody di@@ vest@@ ments , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those affected are usually come to ste@@ er the meat and dairy products to re@@ lie@@ ve their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an of proteins to contribute to develop immune cells , which promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , declared that immune cells in the intest@@ ine pat@@ rou@@ ts , to ensure that dam@@ aging micro@@ bes that hide in the food not into the body .
cells that are capable of trig@@ gering inflammation , are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without being sensitive tissues .
if the balance is too distant in the direction of inflammation , it can result in a inflammat@@ ory effect .
in experiments , found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cells is found in mice , which carry out a certain bacter@@ ium in its initiation .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an - one of the buil@@ ders of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacter@@ i@@ art - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an attached to tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an nutrition toler@@ ate food toler@@ ated , less anti @-@ inflammat@@ ory , if the same system will also work with people .
the post@@ doc@@ toral candidate in Dr. Luisa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance and found that a group of studies involving such cells had , but another group of the same tribe , which was but separated not .
they suspected that the difference to do with the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ omen of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , who usually live in the gast@@ ro @-@ intest@@ inal tract .
the di@@ aries of the mice have found DNA sequ@@ ences and there were six species that were present in the mice with the immune cells , but without them inf@@ alli@@ ed with the mice .
mice were raised in a ster@@ ile environment so that they have not developed a gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not developed this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells were created .
in order to understand how the bacteria per@@ taining to the immune system , the researchers left L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a fluid and then led to small amounts of fluid , without the bacteria - on un@@ ri@@ pe immune cells that were isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component was cleaned from the fluid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an met@@ abolic disorders which is known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ to@@ ic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by approximately 50 percent , but when the tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ al values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells declined by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an declared that people have the same toler@@ anced cells such as mice , and that most of us L. rep@@ ter@@ i protect us in our gast@@ ro @-@ intest@@ inal tract .
it is unknown if tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an adren@@ al glands made from L. reu@@ ter@@ i the cells in humans develop as with mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an were found in people with anti @-@ inflammat@@ ory diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an@@ values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with Nem@@ anja M@@ atic

the pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state Washington , but the drawing began but in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers over the US , these are several thousand kilometres .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the rad@@ ar shield was the form of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole was an endurance for new engines .
Boeing had already done such advertising earlier .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
new chassis for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
how the wind is turning : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was a SPD leader , they looked at social @-@ democratic prime minister before elections always with a certain concern to Berlin .
merely no accidents from the party central , merely no counter @-@ wind from the Bund - so lou@@ der the most important wish of the elec@@ toral champ@@ ions .
since Martin Schulz has led the party , the fundamentally changed .
since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus am watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed country @-@ capitals .
what Mr Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described by counter@@ wind .
there were low@@ case .
and one after another .
the federal government @-@ CD@@ U looks after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , a general signal against co@@ al@@ itions of the SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising fac@@ tional stri@@ pes of a Green directive has led the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) in a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the Moroccan choice , his red @-@ green coalition led their one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green leader Michael Kell@@ ner has promp@@ ted the Ab@@ tr@@ ün@@ d @-@ Sax@@ on @-@ Sax@@ on @-@ Sax@@ on @-@ Sax@@ on @-@ jack@@ ets to return their mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transfer to the CD@@ U means a clear condem@@ nation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; voters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately give her mandate back , &quot; said the federal leader and the election campaigns of the Green Network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this should not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sigh@@ s a SPD @-@ election &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when on Friday morning , the new hi@@ d@@ ban was reached by the party central &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan W@@ eil , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the remains of the green @-@ called El@@ ke T@@ westen to CD@@ U without its own government .
it is the pro@@ visional seat of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD .
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere started with the unexpected defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , more not , re@@ ass@@ uring the comrades of the time .
after the National@@ rats@@ wahlen in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , everything will be different .
this then became too - and it became clearly worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the Tau@@ m@@ eln , the Düsseldorf @-@ ple@@ ite hau@@ l the party .
aw@@ et@@ ched the comrades in the weeks after that .
then when they had just turned new courage , the G @-@ 20 @-@ peak of Hamburg came from Hamburg .
and with him the next low @-@ supplement came .
Mayor O@@ la@@ f Scholz , the last strong SPD landscapes , lost on that weekend his Nim@@ bus because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city burned .
and because he that was mist@@ aken in the crisis communication so much everything you can do wrong .
since then , Scholz - has been fighting for its political survival .
so now Stephan W@@ eil .
due to the VW @-@ bure@@ tor and his role in the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board , the Dutch minister stood already in criticism .
Mi@@ ile Re@@ quest@@ e@@ assets was added .
nevertheless , or perhaps straight therefore , W@@ eil tried to set stronger over the past weeks in the federal government .
the aim of the former mayor of Hannover , to develop his power in Berlin , remained hidden and hidden from Martin Schulz as well .
they let him grant him because they spoke of w@@ eil a stabili@@ zation of the party .
on the exact opposite , the exact opposite could enter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , W@@ eil meets the im@@ part of the party on the party , which is basically no fault . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and Schulz does not at all .
sometimes the comrades make an effort to keep their own ranks closed .
your wrath is directed towards the Green , and here especially on the tr@@ ench of female parliament@@ arians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democr@@ acies , like Mrs T@@ westen her own career interests , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , leader of the party left in the SPD parliamentary group , &quot; says M@@ TT network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Ms. T@@ westen is not elected because of her person as direct can@@ did , but on the state of the Dutch @-@ Sax@@ on green in parliament , so the Dutch representative continues .
the logical consequence would be that they with@@ hold their mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD @-@ Bundestag fac@@ tion , l@@ aments a &quot; democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ tor@@ ate four years ago was clear : the people have taken Stephan W@@ eil to the Prime Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who takes the Dutch SPD to the German candidate to the Bundestag @-@ election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now fal@@ si@@ fied the personal career level of a future CD@@ U @-@ D Euro MPs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ordered to clarify the background .
I want to know if there has been more or has given it further engagement of the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
Förder@@ gel@@ ot for Ort@@ sk@@ ern III
who would like to leave the house in the years can soon get support from the country .
in addition , Mayor of Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of Ste@@ g Stadt@@ develop@@ e on Wednesday in received .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave a glimp@@ se to the so far back .
since 1991 it has been initiated in emp@@ t@@ inge areas .
at that time , in the refurb@@ ishment of I from 1991 to 2004 , the Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the convey@@ or .
in the refurb@@ ishment area II from 2005 to 2016 the subsi@@ dy was still at 60 percent .
for s@@ ind@@ ler , the previous plumbing is a &quot; successful project &quot; - it is finally important to promote the interior development and not just close new building areas .
on April 4 you received from the Intergovernmental Conference on April 4 , where there will be a refurb@@ ishment III .
the grant amount will charge 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which milit@@ ant 500 000 Euros from the country , the rest of the community received .
how now is a refurb@@ ishment ?
you will continue to examine so Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it also plays a role , whether in the planned area at all interest rates , to san@@ ate .
if necessary , the border limits could then also be postpon@@ ed again .
the Ste@@ g works on Wednesday evening : Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
cellar presented the contents of the Bund @-@ country @-@ program &quot; Social City , &quot; whose divisions would then be carried out .
the core of the programme is the re@@ vit@@ alization of internal cities , the improvement of living and working conditions and the up@@ grading and expansion of infrastructure .
the measures would be objective , which means per plot , carried out .
the refurb@@ ishment would finally be defined as the stat@@ utes .
the expedition period for funding runs since 1 January 2017 and 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year , however , it would only be carried out once , in the context of those who want to fill out a questionnaire to fill out a questionnaire .
in November or December the stat@@ utes has to be made possible , so that in the coming year , it is possible to commen@@ ce the renovation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann stated that each municipality will conduct the preliminary studies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is therefore going to assess the urban mis@@ conditions and decide when san@@ ated and to what extent .
for the particular land there will be a refurb@@ ishment in the basic book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come back again and get a picture of the situation they spoke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Got@@ zel stressed , a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
that is why there will be quest@@ ionn@@ aires who will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out by the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building and plot of land , &quot; with which it goes among other things about construc@@ tively and refurb@@ ishment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and urban@@ ization &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can make information on size , distribution and residents of a living room . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O.@@ bogen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to fill out if in the building business rooms are operated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , to note , Got@@ zel pointed out that a well @-@ filled questionnaire was not at the same time a request for funding .
furthermore , new measures are not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler stressed that the distribution of p@@ ants after the &quot; Wind@@ dog Prin@@ ci@@ ple - who comes first , h@@ itting first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot reserve the convey@@ or for later &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conclusion , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ ors himself gives himself a Micro@@ chip in order to get in house and car with a handful of movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his door@@ step , to enter his office and even start with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and fo@@ ref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .

the over@@ head of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers for thousands
the decision of the White House , a nav@@ y helic@@ opter for an event to fly to the South La@@ wn , it costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the claims of the military that has been entru@@ sted to the TIME magazine , up to 24,@@ 000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Chief of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helic@@ op@@ ters was issued next to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ works made of Wis@@ cons@@ in and a for@@ kli@@ ft from Mississippi .
the military office of the White House called for the presence of helic@@ opter in a frag@@ mentary order or FRA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before helic@@ opter in the Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for operation of the helic@@ opter .
&quot; I just wanted to realize that you are aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the com@@ mander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superi@@ ors , the Dep@@ uty Marin@@ ek@@ om@@ man@@ de@@ ur for aviation .
the message showed that helic@@ op@@ ters arrived on 17 July at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long stayed until the lawn was tidy between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note add that if the departure from the White House should be del@@ ayed , due to the restriction of the hours a second team would require for the flight back .
the original flight was found during the event at the helic@@ opter , while the security guards of the unit remained on the floor during the time on the plane .
arising from the records provided , it was not clear whether for ultimately a second flight registration was required .
the H@@ atch Act provides state @-@ to @-@ use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked whether the event could hurt the identification .
&quot; one question we had , was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch area , and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command@@ ant .
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; the dep@@ uty command@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political wa@@ it@@ ones .
at the event , the president gave an impetus to reform of health reform , which was going on in the Senate , and he prov@@ oked the efforts for a da@@ w@@ ning of government regulations .
the use of the plane , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .
President are oblig@@ ated to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo OP is unusual .
Tr@@ ump was conducted in February an investigation into the background of his first Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of announ@@ cements that are compl@@ aining about the use of the presidential flight by its predec@@ essors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is delighted with the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; the Dep@@ uty director of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 occup@@ ations often lead to training trips in the region around Washington and South La@@ wn to susp@@ end the US President in the White House with precise Zenti@@ s .
as tr@@ ump in early July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany introduced H@@ MX @-@ 1 in the White House 58 exercises .
the flight to the &quot; Made in America &quot; event was in case of training needed for the month , said an official .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ic@@ opter @-@ units flew in addition to 11 hours on this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ president &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said the tax@@ pay@@ ers were the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Sik@@ or@@ sky said , the company was not involved in bringing the helic@@ opter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 maintains no budget design@@ ations for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the aid of the U.S. defence Ministry for the Financial Year 2017 , the Do@@ D @-@ replacement for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is however 24,@@ 380 USD per flight @-@ hour .
records of unity record the flight time of the aircraft than 30 minutes from the hom@@ ey @-@ Marine Cor@@ ps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual cost of the operation of the helic@@ opter is far from this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the costs for tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for re@@ funds is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this estimates include staff , maintenance and many others hidden costs that are included in the annual means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a margin study from 2015 , the re@@ funds for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs but also take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract .
at this time the former spokes@@ person of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er defended the use of helic@@ op@@ ters for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that week are produced in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the federal state of Connecticut are very proud of that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helic@@ opter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly .
it is of course appropriate to empha@@ size this . &quot;
it was not clear if Tr@@ ump was intern@@ ed with the helic@@ opter when he entered his circuit over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver of a fire@@ wood fire .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ oking with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very good , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss at tricky task

the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss will take effect tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the Tab@@ ell@@ end@@ steps Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV .
despite after five games still f@@ law@@ less company , the leader of the second tennis Bundes@@ liga has received the sense of reality .
chef Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has any respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team that is always playing in quite similar formation .
especially on the rear positions I find the team very well . &quot;
for class and stability in the sou@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV , mainly imports from the high north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to bet@@ s in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strongly in the double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view of Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ova@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben Ol@@ esen , Martin Peder@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ re@@ hus ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; this becomes as always hard for us .
you also need a good serving luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ uss crew for the Trip in the Far North stands practically .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
at the moment the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active French@@ man will not come to the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Par@@ tie , the tournament takes place at the tournament in Czech Liber@@ ec spiel@@ ende Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) at his first place in this season .

how America can harm O@@ MV
really happy called Donald Tr@@ ump when he put his signature under the law for the tigh@@ tening of sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his p@@ ast , to er@@ ect the law , &quot; the Congress have packed a few &quot; constitutional regulations &quot; .
also the response from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was sp@@ elled against the US incur@@ sion .
after all , the draft is seen to pun@@ ish European companies which help Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to wor@@ rying developments since the domestic ou@@ MV , which are co @-@ financed by other European companies to build the Russian East region Nord Stream 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dr@@ on is gri@@ ev@@ ous .
nevertheless , it was too early for an assessment of consequences , so the official statement of the oil company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact Donald Tr@@ ump even needs to bring the sanctions to life by an executive order . &quot; &quot; &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him for the election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has looked at which the Group could rep@@ el and which could really w@@ ager him . &quot; &quot; &quot;

despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar K@@ iller is revealed , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is not yet over for a long time .
the dis@@ ks three and four were already confirmed by the Stream@@ ing Service , the first received its first trailer and showed the latest Bö@@ se@@ wi@@ ped of the show .
with the third season the DE@@ A has directed its attention to the rich@@ est organization of drug trafficking : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kart@@ ell .
led by four powerful ph@@ ates , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 @-@ company &quot; with more state stocks and violent actions .

roll back@@ wards : the city places 46 ch@@ ants
the town is organized the K@@ ita @-@ lun@@ stic itself again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the urban nur@@ sery , the clock will be turned back .
as of September 1 , the town Kre@@ feld takes over the essence of eating in the urban pa@@ edi@@ s facilities ( kit@@ as ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sonja Pom@@ er , dep@@ uty leader in the youth , this is good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are all very happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooked to be out except house : a Cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh water cool@@ ed .
the city operates in the field of 46 nur@@ sery , in 44 children at lun@@ ch@@ time a warm meal .
in the past Kit@@ aj@@ ahr , each of 28@@ 00 children at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by now not only children who are looked after 45 days to noon in the K@@ ita &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children stay up to 14 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 sub@@ tim@@ ers from 1 September cooking service : they war@@ med the admir@@ ent dishes , complement them around salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individual , give the food made up , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the workers will be assigned to a crop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ omm@@ tolerance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ group@@ ed as well as seventh facilities - determines the difference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen hel@@ per now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ omm@@ intoler@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much stronger and it is easier for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your genital &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why it is about healthy eating and cooking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen @-@ power of the team is sensible .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not ever @-@ changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleans@@ ing of the K@@ ita rooms - also the task of the kitchen forces - will be done in future by specialist cleaning personnel .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has next to the quality refin@@ ement of the kitchen power also the charm that it turned out in the cost comparison between original rainy and foreign exchange for the city as the most economical solution , it is from the press office .
and that , although 46 sub @-@ tim@@ ers are re@@ employed .
&quot; but these hours fall at around 750 people in the drawing area not so strongly into the weight , &quot; says Sonja Pom@@ er .
the Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative when all members of society , including women , play a role , the leader of the UN Mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , the director of the Mission of the United Nations , said that hundreds of women are fac@@ eted in the provinces in the provinces . three women can@@ v@@ ases for the role of the Vice President and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a Statement .
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble when women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for provincial council and the presidential elections will take place on April 5th .
the Taliban made threats against a election process , which coinci@@ de with the transition from international combat operations to an consult@@ ative role .
this year the elections for the first time will be peac@@ efully handed away from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said , a strong role for women will step up the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an independent election Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total registered 3,@@ 6 million voters .

G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie @-@ Fabrik in Glas@@ go@@ w
one trade union would like to join the managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it @-@ producer Mc@@ W@@ ie on the long @-@ term commitment to production in their work in Glas@@ go@@ w .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company broke out about the future of investing at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the work , next to other products of Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea Kek@@ se .
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that workers and trade union representatives would be experienced as the first to change their activities .
in a letter to the Fili@@ alle@@ z@@ ite the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s to express &quot; concerns that funding for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be driven forward . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior organizer &quot; Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can gain no clarity about the needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the labor force focus heavily on the local community and the Gre@@ ater Glas@@ go@@ w , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social dis@@ advant@@ aged people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , the Loh@@ ns and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ xit , the rising cost of life and the chronic flow of production , the eastern end of Glas@@ go@@ w urgently need a thri@@ ving production of production at Mc@@ Show@@ y . &quot;
speaking of Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; the Fili@@ ol@@ ite at T@@ oll@@ cross has only signed a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it as we appreciate the continuous engagement with employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives in T@@ oll@@ cross where some questions were openly discussed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we discussed the staff that we operate in an extremely competitive and uns@@ afe economic li@@ ma , our business continuously checked - and this applies to all our business areas and sites - to be competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she added : &quot; in recent years we invested in our T@@ oll@@ cross @-@ site more than 5 million pounds , especially in production lines and operational improvements .
we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site . should our business processes change at the site , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PSG Barcelona warned three years before N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the site of La Liga likes to regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain is not handed over in their persecution by N@@ ey@@ mar , after having given an offer of £ 189 million , to dis@@ solve its free@@ wheel pi@@ vot@@ al , but have they warned these three years before the world event ?
the sens@@ ational approach has risen the transfer window in the summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 @-@ Klu@@ b is ready to break the world record for more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba in the past season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United .
after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and for the highest @-@ paid professional athletes of the world . PSG offers wages from more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fu@@ ri@@ ous about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced its way home outside , although a source in the proximity of Catal@@ anas state that the club has always given its best to take care of it since its arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG President before this prospect ?
as Manchester City 2014 interested in signing Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every association , who wanted to be one of the best players of PSG .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players to sign in , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have passed this line whereby the Spanish association was in the beginning of this summer interest in the PSG mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PSG made clear that they would not allow the International of Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by moving one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Bericht ent@@ last@@ et Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report about the Miss@@ ouri Falls , the Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and histor@@ ian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report for the mis@@ chi@@ al sc@@ andal in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussion .
Christian Weis@@ ler , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated after the publication from the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger bishop and today Car@@ dinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and from the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year brother of the Emer@@ itus Benedi@@ kt Benedi@@ kt X@@ VI@@ . , an exc@@ use .
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger take their deep regret about their own om@@ issions or their at that time false assessment of the proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand critic@@ ized that when reporting on violence in Dom@@ sp@@ atzen is measured with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two things &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no doubt that there would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful actions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would have to be pun@@ ished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; degree of medi@@ al mani@@ pulation , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the author of Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historians and a member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of a cath@@ olic church as a source of all ev@@ ils is already part of the day @-@ day experience and is preparing the public opinion that will hold it normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also Für@@ st@@ in Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking forward to the church and this is an un@@ th@@ ink@@ able fres@@ co@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beats a very normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to cope with the children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they call it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on the mis@@ use cases de@@ generated also pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
quite w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly , says author and histor@@ ian Michael Hes@@ emann , who with R@@ atz@@ inger the reminder of &quot; My brother der Pope &quot; written ( in 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ atz@@ inger in Protection &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all that had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he adds the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is written in the 440 @-@ page report , which presented by the di@@ oc@@ ese in Regensburg with the educ@@ ative lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 54@@ 7 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were used in between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high Pl@@ au@@ si@@ bility &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report , it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was working from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; sum@@ ming up , so that I was applied by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and mental violence .
especially with a high level of Emot@@ ion@@ ality , the bri@@ ghtness was able to compens@@ ate for the students even more disast@@ rous .
yet contrary to numerous other def@@ endants , that many victims were ass@@ ass@@ ed the general humanity of R. , and therefore in many cases , despite violence even a positive memories connect with it . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann , why the final report about the mis@@ use sc@@ andal in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger of his opinion has been dischar@@ ged .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ Pages report on the &quot; Pre@@ ferences of Non @-@ violence against the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a conf@@ lic@@ ting picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
for one set out many students his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand he also appears as a chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became hand @-@ gr@@ it@@ ous when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz has not brought a top performance .
how do you evaluate as its bio@@ grapher this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : when one gets the effort and read the whole 440 pages long story from the front to the back , one must ask yourself rather , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is found at all in it .
he is dedicated to eight pages just once and he is clearly acqu@@ itted from any suspic@@ ion of the mid@@ - or co @-@ wis@@ s in the terrible cases sexual abuse .
the non @-@ violence at the pre@@ school took place outside of its sphere of efficiency .
you can take it out , too late to experience or have taken first announ@@ cements seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the forec@@ ast@@ ing school , on which he was real , was felt by practically all respon@@ dents than - so literally - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so also the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also describes an excellent , &quot; knowled@@ geable , &quot; &quot; knowled@@ geable , &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who served the guys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons , and &quot; always conf@@ isc@@ ated by the grapes of children .
only a minority compl@@ ains about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emoti@@ on@@ ality , which already led to W@@ ut@@ aus@@ erup@@ ted too .
that he was not only cast with chairs and thre@@ w the keys and bow@@ ed on the ground , but also ear@@ marks , and all too che@@ ek@@ ed guys moved to the hair or ears , he has given themselves earlier years ago , deeply regre@@ ts and exc@@ used for them .
the honour of his honor must be noted , however , that such delivery methods in the frag@@ ile time , the 1960s and 19@@ 70s have been common , while parents like with teachers .
do you also have such bre@@ eder methods ?
naturally , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
even I have seen it in a world@@ ly school , a state @-@ Gymnasium .
compared with what actually goes in this report , namely the rec@@ tion@@ able sexual abuse and the non @-@ violence at the pre@@ school , are the fre@@ igh@@ ting dre@@ d@@ els .
we asked yourself if it was not likely to do with his famili@@ arity and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ kt X@@ VI@@ . to do that many media has just fell upon him .
in the Bav@@ arian pop@@ e there are many who have never understood him , still free@@ zing .
the truth however is : the report ent@@ last@@ et Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in the media , the report has been very much informed about the issue of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also contain any execution or co @-@ operation with regard to sexual abuse of the load ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clear no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual over@@ gri@@ ps claims to have entru@@ sted the domain master .
not even the parents were dedicated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never wonder@@ ed to speak with my father or my mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a subject of subject for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the true problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse and is to be silent on the issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if they did not even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral leader , who still would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do you judge the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ student R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : an question@@ able student form@@ ulated it : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see any case , in the well @-@ being ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely insights and could have the respective perpet@@ rators .
I consider it ... also for really absurd , to embrace that with him ... Bub@@ bles or more clear or more likely to have opened , as compared with their parents , dormit@@ ory boards , Trust instruc@@ tors etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ th@@ ink@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the student and / or their environment att@@ ained them could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore fre@@ aked about every fellow @-@ speaking .
thus it cannot be thrown out , not prevent it or brought to the display .
therefore , there is no reason to associate his good name with these contradic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately it happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media was much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thrown in the report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Find &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and non@@ violence and somewhere , in the middle of George R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is precisely the abuse of the report .
thus , there will be clean separate : between pre@@ school and the gramm@@ ar school of Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and non @-@ violence , we say once , other inci@@ dents .
in addition , the report inci@@ dents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral leader of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the whole horri@@ ble test ped@@ ago@@ gi@@ k , the cases where Kn@@ aben from sa@@ dist@@ ic teachers were indic@@ ted and mal@@ ign@@ ed , and among them de@@ composed , un@@ occupied himself at the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen und P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sk@@ and@@ al@@ ous states have to have prevented .
but with those who had nothing to do with Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because he got the boys only when they were already at the forec@@ ast@@ ing school .
on it was like the most witnesses stress the topic &quot; pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ u .
you were only happy to be able to get her out and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise . &quot;
what was different at the forec@@ ast@@ ing school ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there is still discipline , but it is not a sa@@ dist@@ ic violence .
and that is also true for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims were ass@@ ass@@ ed the general humanity of R. , and therefore , in many cases , despite violence even a positive memories connect with it . &quot;
so most of the accus@@ ation still remains .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods when reported by the state at the pre@@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and from the events at a school which he was not working and responsible ( so the witness ) wanted nothing to hear , and then again around 1993 .
castle Georg R@@ atz@@ inger systematically in front of the states consistently ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ th@@ asia that the report even re@@ produces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he points out that in the pre@@ school , the test will continue to be pract@@ ised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in the light of the risk of negative press , he recommended the ability to advance .
this was of course at a time when legal clarity existed , when exam@@ inees were also banned in Bavaria for a long time .
before , it occurred in a legal gray area , as everybody knows of us at the same time .
it was difficult for him to estimate it , where people might be exagger@@ ated or dra@@ fted , and where really the per@@ missible limit had been crossed .
but one can not say it , he would have always looked away .
this is simply not true .
in 1980 the exam@@ ines of schools were officially established in Bavaria too .
prin@@ c@@ ess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said yes , it was unfair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards to the dam@@ aging time .
how do you see this ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking to historians as of the &quot; par@@ stri@@ ck of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; thus the danger to present it &apos;s moral standard for today &apos;s moral standard .
the prin@@ c@@ ess has already right .
but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse at all times and also not for what was broken in pre@@ school for resistance and violence in inno@@ cent pra@@ w@@ ns , which is already far beyond that time .
it &apos;s all quite aw@@ ful and I am glad that it is finally aff@@ lic@@ ated .
but at the same time I must take the protection of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , for all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , so ear@@ che@@ ers and ears are drawn to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 19@@ 70s .
as a physical radi@@ ance then he was strictly forbidden to adhere strictly to it .
which image of his Reg@@ ens@@ burger time has given George R@@ atz@@ inger because in the talks with you for the book &apos; My brother of Pope &apos; ?
did the issue check back on to the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , told his perspective as played the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen only a secondary role .
nevertheless , I am not at all concerned that he carried a stric@@ ter reg@@ iment .
but that must also be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ist , without the un@@ demanding un@@ conditioned discipline , it would probably have been possible to form an institution of world @-@ known Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen an institution of world @-@ tran@@ sports , true cultural message in Europe and his musical tradition , which went to the U.S. twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons alone you don &apos;t even make a huge voc@@ alist and in front of every success , just in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of people do you have experienced George R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks to her book ?
Michael H@@ atz@@ emann : by working on the book and in addition I have experienced George R@@ atz@@ inger really well over and over again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , livel@@ i@@ hood , deep believing , and hearty , from which one could not imagine that he could do just a fly of something .
I come regularly with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are still today , 23 years after its Emer@@ gence , regularly contact him , visit him - he is almost blind - and how to treat it as a member of their family .
those who have not given him up to this day is therefore strictly in the minority .
most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are today thankful to him today that he enh@@ ances their lives and brought to them the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a stric@@ ter father , certainly , that may be - but still a lov@@ able respect she was still looking for and buried them .
and please , once again clear : everything you are pre@@ thro@@ ws are gu@@ ardian methods that were then on the agenda at that time .
we can be glad that we have overcome this time ago .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because it is promin@@ ently and still has an even prominent brother to make the medi@@ al s@@ cap@@ ego@@ ats .
that is the nasty intention , which is behind it , only too obvious .
because the report that has just been published , reli@@ eved him .
now the dec@@ ency area would be a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside Bay@@ erns and probably no one would know yet the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen would finally be taken into peace .
