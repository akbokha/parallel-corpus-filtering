<seg id="3">A pit-kapelle, where now is dug for the S-Bahn-Tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardener manage the one-old reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card coin rolls exciting stories to days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if landkarten is not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">This knows each one who had already had an exciting time because the car-Navi took place instead of a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals in Bavaria of the state government, are anything but current - but therefore very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the spread-area of the Münchner Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a Flickr man, which one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the great clarity card, for towns and municipalities were more detailed maps, so called premiere.</seg>
<seg id="13">These emerged according to the Bayerisches Vermessungsverwaltung between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the First Vermessung.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your Client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second State of War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon had an overview of the occupied land and gave an topographical survey of Bavaria - naturally for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if French troops moved to the peace of Lunéville, from 9 February 1801, it was our neighbours that created the idea of a surface area.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Kurfürst Max. Joseph drove further into the project, founded the" "" "topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bayerische Vermessungsadministration." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The book proposition for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all the others to find the Bayerisches Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison morning / Today is most impressive at the example of the country capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example of this is subsubmitting that appears relatively isolated in the map from 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map, thus 1877, as Münchner district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, submissions lies in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses substitches focus on 1856 along the current Plinganserstrasse which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the insurrection of the Bavarian peasants against Austria 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, you can see nothing as fields - at first glance: at the Hinter anlage, appears a small-piece card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered Flurpieces from the so-called "Ureup." from which the property tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots show there today no farmers - but small gardener in the" "" "country" "" "country in the sun." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is characterised by the north of submissions.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 showroom of the October, was in the 19th century a meadow, and no concrete.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of the psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the judgment of the present district Au-Haidhausen not only reads the street name "at Gasteig" or from the peak "On the ventilation" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "yes, here at the" "" "Auerfeldstraße" "" "you once more people with inscription." ""</seg>
<seg id="33">There was in 1858 / 59 the Münchner district-Irrenanstalt "was created.</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden the institution - that psychiatrist, who is in connection with the death of King Ludwigs II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended for example the shareholder of so-called" "" "Irren" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he is forbidden to apply violence against the passengers, "says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Museum Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition of Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients had been first place, later on 500 places has been extended.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity is no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisearnest in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">There since 2006 the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's biggest psychiatrists in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people at the area of the former Auer Anstalt will now meet young people in the Münchner Salesianum.</seg>

<seg id="42">West is located in the football field of the TSV Munich East, east residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015 one organised the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" - in architectural tendence at the original building of the Irrenanstalt founded during the Second World War in bombing raids.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was named after 1856 as the" "" "main square" "", "the department of department was named" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "a decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies in December 1944 many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">One big remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The German Institute, small business houses and a re-kapelle from the Middle Ages was once at Marienhof, where these days will work the pre-work and take place on 5th April 2017 of the Spatenstich for the second S-Bahn line.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slide bar, the old Munich map can be compared with the airpicture of today - and the hole in the Marienhof will be filled.</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizenship-group released travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the promotion of colored people issued a warning for a colored people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and the racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which will come into force by the state until 28 August 2017, since traveling through the state requires special attention, as a number of questionable, bred-based incidents occur recently in the entire state and stated here" "", "it is stated in the opinion of the group." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it difficult to win discrimination against discrimination, as well as the enforcement authorities of the state, the disproportionate on minorities, prompters the group to release the group, told the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of civil rights, which people happen.</seg>
<seg id="55">They are raised because of their skin colour, they are gathered or killed, "the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such an frequency that we have not heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by organising the organisation for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents like racist promises against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no gasoline during the journey and taken away by the police of Missouri in custody without a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "the Council also points to a recent report by the Council of the general state-old of Missouri, in which the black car drivers in the state 75 percent are more common than women." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what might happen to Missouri," said Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be ready to bring us money or know their relatives that they are travelling through the state." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="64">The trip warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company because of housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously the American Civil liberties Union (ACLU) travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states adopted immigration authorities to conceal local law enforcement authorities, which will contribute to further segregation according to the ACLU on further segregation.</seg>
<seg id="66">Tour operators are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but in recent times, stakeholders have implemented the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Weidezaunproject is elemental</seg>
<seg id="68">The fisherman's ordination project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-Bundestagsabordinate Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have created an image on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the Rechtshenhof the family Schwendemann met representatives of the fisherman CDU village, together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially gave insights into his farm, in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest cultivated, 40 cows, and as many young animals looked after and housed in five apartments Ferienges.</seg>
<seg id="72">The "Black-forces" is for him the alternate marketer away for the milk of his cattle, so Tildemann.</seg>
<seg id="73">At the table of the Feriengste comes exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">As he is also the Chairman of the fisherman, he signed the pasture project as a "elementary". "</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not manage in such a steep areas in a profitable way.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area is a lot of work, much of which can be processed using the motor sense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have here with the conditions and with the topography" "", "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the elterous operation and operated this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not lead to bioproduction.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the" "" "ordination project" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">The farmers have to be supported by the costs of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">We hope that the performance of the areas could be drawn up even quite a while ago.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the biggest treasure that we have are people who work in agriculture and make thought of how they continue to bring their operation" "", "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often standing in criticism of funding</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The maintenance surface is that 40 hectares, which can not be inforted until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">The total cost of 71 500 Euro was funded half of the Group, a quarter carried the municipality of Fisbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus we also love the farmers 12 610 euros they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of course.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and landclaws do not go."</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter Weiss stood firm:" "" "here are the best food produced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">Landsaccountable Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg offers the government promotion of enclosures.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The presence of one of the LPR was marked by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">Furthermore, the enclosure area may not be semi-commercial (Hanging over 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the fisherman Weidezaunprojekt 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots that want to build about 16 kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="96">The maintenance surface equivalent to 35 hectares, the cost-calculated cost is more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime transition is it when they begin to atting statues instead.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this just like any other - hence the cautified overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firos Place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key-ideologists of the trump regime, certainly did what he did when he was a symbolic key with Jim Acosta from CNN about the proposals of the President to the drastic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller reached not the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of jetties and Liberty Imitators would have fought him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he laid their significance, and in particular the meaning that it was written, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller Acosta, "I want to go here not on a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom, which illuminated the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem on which you relate it was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is proper right, but how he formulated it itself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance on the ascending words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your effortless, your arms, / your beating masses, who after that longing, free to breathe, / the elastic waste of your wealthy shores."</seg>
<seg id="109">There never was a time when the "elend Abfall" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller got involved in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict about the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who sat down to place their words after their death on the basis - did very good that they did a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism, showing the feminine portraying of the feminine embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives himself an entirely different name: mother of exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist Coup and an devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just like Lazarus the significance of the statue changed, the people from the right wing didn't want to change this long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of Johannes of the Buyer for the coming of Trump, argued 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was no one, but rather an early neocon-conservative man, who is the American flame into the around the world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">She is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not supposed to enlighten the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limconstrucgh here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite and certainly a matter of point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they seen from the exhaustive, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the Decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It's going to be in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that you want to recognize Miller and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not experience the path, but the hatred, who is their only source of power, igniting.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championships 2017: Neil Black lobt Scottish members of the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two villi belonging to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance direktor of the UK's Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-shamanic controversies can make a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">Record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 which starts on Friday.</seg>

<seg id="134">"" "" "" "I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done." ""</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type at the corner corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals-candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m circuit, while Eilidh Doyle was elected to the team member.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "your captain's speech was amazing," "" "says Black." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or where they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the genuine feel that Eiliie took quite naturally, were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth of Silver Medal, which is in its fifth world cup, with the 400-m hurdles, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 villi are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total amount of athletes during the World Cup was seven, which was reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-distance Muir runs past five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, the 1,500 m runs, another Scotsman, which one is looking for a great season that included the victory in the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">He remembers their first World Championships as the only other Scotsman in the team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">The Mannist chapters say that they are "immense" to the fact that many of their compatriots do not only belong to the team, but in some cases are also among the medals and among the Finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing to be this team is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour, but knowing that my team-mates voted for me and chose to have something very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the villi who belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows only how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes, who want to ascend on pods.</seg>
<seg id="155">What my talk as captain concerns?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that in this situation we are very happy as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put on this visitation and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just being a great atmosphere there. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Block all critics about Facebook: don't ask you for a public position if you cannot tolerate the inserts of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our land knew some of the bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington but it didn't take long until the newspapers bore him for everything, from the internal policy up to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He shaved in criticism, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not brought his critics into silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783 Washington said," "" "the freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and wordless, we shall be led as the sheep to the battles." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland governor Larry Hogan who must work on it, more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on its official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil War Union defendant him therefore at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The rod of the governor dismissed the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Na, and?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if there is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state which is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest authority of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary Hitzhead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a strong hand in the guidance of his state and strict compliance with principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillfully to use Facebook as primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his hairy head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore the blockade of people who come to the side of the Governor - which is a public forum that is officially called by public tax currency - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post office in Amelia Chasse-Sprecherin Amelia Chasse the actions of the governor and argued that the blockade of the comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too simple to use the image by TROLLEN or spammers or hopping Points, who vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak with their chosen guides, a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, does not lead a role.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments are respectful, thoughtful and not profited.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appealed to the Apostolic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Attorney, Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, MD., was not filled, but she asked to hate Hassan.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I found politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other recent news," "" "wrote them in the commentary box of the" "" "The Post." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I don't appreciate this idea if a number of people take place on the same subject, they are misunderstood by some rather than a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">What the employees of the governors were as a "concentrated Spam-attack," others would probably call 'intercation'.</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply gets a critic or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "" "" "it is a lot of cleaner than in former times when people have done the same to collect newspapers with critical leadership patterns and to burn or bolted demonstrators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">But that is exactly what is happening on digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official that is criticised to that he implied Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is borderings by Twitter-users who were blocked by his Twitter feeds.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones were last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County last the First Amendment, according to U.S. borderters James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she called a votal voters from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) received a visit from the ACLU due to its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the moment Washington's time had a similar effect on the Internet at affordable Portos.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter envelopes to his leadership.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living in large living: mezzanine and clever designers have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court Apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne hasn't packed their bags and sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I searched for something that was comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I have fallen in love in her and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot of the apartment was completely outdated.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-bedroom estate with a screwed layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she instructed the Architektur- and Designstudio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill that made the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two spaces over to each other, so the architectonical challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the award.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel plant is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the spaces so they were overthrown, without we had to gaps." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">It was not just about building a simple platform but to create the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or at the bottom. "</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement allowed it to place Erfan, two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine can look back a classic copper-window from retrouvius via the glamorous apartement.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Tempered Goldstalls, Silberne Akzente and Vintage Serge Mouille lights set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both Enden a short corridor is mirrored to let him last longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirror feel like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance we have cleaned units for all the seating and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space the beauty of the sitting room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The specifics of this is that it is a clocking door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went in," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, frightened MDF door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is opposite, so that when you push the door, very easy going."</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage room, Joanne additional 16 m ² gain, an extra bedroom and a improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land, or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and have a calculation on the ground size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high quality materials to gain access to this luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and therefore help create an emotional relationship in a home," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love you into the electric sockets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can be characterized by good design and increased square metric capacity of slightly by default into something very amazing.</seg>

<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new Barop of the White House is planning to limit the information flow to President Trump - including the reports of the news media - in the hope to keep the chef on a moderate course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"as John F. Kelly, the new staff member of the White House, at his first working day with leading employees, he set a major problem in President Donald Trumps white House that he wants to fix: bad information, which got into the hands of the president.</seg>

<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to taps Trump by monitoring his media.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship to television reaches decades - and now where he is in the White House, his TV-coloring was still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "when Candididat Trump was annoyed because of an unfair coverage it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places to convince," "", "said the former electoral consultant Sam Nunberg in February to Politico." ""</seg>

<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter-habit ever "was" under control "is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps those fighting on something we don't know anything that we don't know - that stretcher Tweets without their interventions would have made even more ignition.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never find out something about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>

<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House that relies on competing parties repeatedly calling for their own agenda by promoting footbump material that possibly promotes their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - quite with this story - reported in May on the preference of advisors to assign the President for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example that was described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say that Trump as a volcano can react to negative press issues, especially those with damaged leaks and that he can turn out to get out where these originate." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly this happened in late February, when someone gave the President malicious one-printed copy of a article from Gotnews.com, the website of the internet Provokateurs Charles C. Johnson, who announced the Deputy Stabiliation Katie Walsh, "the source behind a bunch of Lecks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson had banned from Twitter because of chicane or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he expressed wrong accusations and invoke it in the past.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager as pristus, but trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still seek influence.</seg>

<seg id="1810">The staff of the Weekly Riodoce usually meet in twochs to check their plans for the coverage of the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa, through organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists will discuss what feels more secure: they are supposed to take her children to the office which were the aim of an attack with granulates, or let them go home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a plate at the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporter, names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and abs.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drugs enmuggler, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of the government or the cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no break-break from violence, and while throughout the country the corpses are frequent as at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are standing after attacks and threats, and until now there was at least seven deaths in seven countries.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is their editors and their inspiration from Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">Its absence will be felt deep, although its presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Valdez presented its midfinger with the word "Justice" on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporter in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, who show his smiling face with glasses or its typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters are discussing about their shared issues, the trauma, its nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">"" "" "" "although in 2010 a special law office was erected to process the cases of journalists, this according to the committee in the protection of journalists has passed only two criminal proceedings." ""</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders who are linked each year with drug-commerce and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely put in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa although they are uncomforting and even though the terrain is still verräterous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information on the murderers without justice, the meeting has little benefits to discussing the security, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very silly to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we do not know the Why bust we all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital city of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only made it a few blocks away before the red Toyota Corolla was raised by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated into the "Zwölfter River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it close.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adults.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans remuneration last year and the delivery into the United States in January was Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battps of the country, as rival groups fight here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day one or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery full is full of two-story mouse-zones for drug-ents that are bigger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget about a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" if only a Kartell has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez has been aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the blame that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First in February the publication of a interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaled anti-fractions in the war with Guzmans Sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may refuse the sons, suspected gangsters bought every copy of the issue once they were delivered to time limits.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault was that Valdez are not forced to force, after the confiscation of a different newspaper, the same story had been released to leave the country to its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killings is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues anned that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined with five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism without reaching a dowry problem," said Buoquez.</seg>
<seg id="1847">With the time the newspaper has earned a reputation because of courageous and honest coverage, and revenues and advertising.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporter loved, harsh investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were captivated by a publication in which they could read stories, who no one could deal with.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Prize" for their reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez presented the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history, wherever they lead.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself to him that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of CPJ award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drugs in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV in October.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "you need to take over the task that you as a journalist sign, either that or you play the dumb." ""</seg>

<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Buoquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-maintenance.</seg>

<seg id="1936">"it will enter into knowledge history as one of the most beautiful and preserved dinosaurs individuals - the mona Lisa of the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this plant-eaters, although it is covered with an armor and a shifting tank, probably under meat was threatened by meat.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The severe armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide themselves from prey, and used an exhaust technology that is known as counterparts that is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would allow it to mix better into its surroundings and steeping its enemies, say experts, which indicates that it was threatened by major dinosaurs.</seg>

<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shredness is common, the results are surprising, since the size of Boomopelta is far exceeds the animals living today.</seg>

<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that appoint the confession - think of roe deer, zebras or gürtelals - are much smaller and vulnerable as loot, which signaled that this Nodosaurs was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"powerful beast-behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs of beasts have to have been," said Brown.</seg>

<seg id="1957">This belongs to the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tonnes heavier monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Boomopelta versank after death in the sea and rectified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he died on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum it is the most preserved armored dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armaments, and is entirely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch-long points which raged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored Pflanzenfresser was welded by the Western Canada until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater illation of the dinosauriers kept his armor in an exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The hidden descripts of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin is still holpright droughs along the dinosauriers</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as a profit in the lottery.</seg>

<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and Protestant, of love and loss, strength and resistance, which arises from the point of view of the human being who live in community and have filled the streets to challenge answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">As Ferrell, with her daughter who carried a flower garment and a suitable crown, to Ferguson, the two talking about a conversation, which she had countless times before this morning, "about the black experience and the black state."</seg>

<seg id="2049">Even though I have the luck to give her an experience in which she does not experience an eklatant racism, it is no different from the next black ladies child.</seg>

<seg id="2053">They prepared handbags before and helped, pass them on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly started to take a new type of activism for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed after the 9th of August," she said and notices that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President in the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>

<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell met in an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-director of the film.</seg>

<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and for the humanization of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrels history repeated history plays the role of black gay women in the broader black-color movement.</seg>

<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which opened on August 2nd, is called A Becoming of blance (An appropriate similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">It is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline is united in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a transwife and landmark disassembly, whose conviction of Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days in his post.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithm analysis of DNA that could be created by Manning and how someone with these genomic data could look like anyone with these genomous data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the indurated determinations of these interpretations - but also to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already been talking about the identification as a woman since its puberty was condemned 2013 because of 20 accusations, among them six clashes against the espionesetz, computer was and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her image was suppressed so much that there was only a single photo - a gracious, black-white self-whie, sitting in the Manning obviously uncomfortable on a driver's seat and a platinblonde perong is carrying - with which it was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of their 2012-project 'stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist's portraiture produced from stranger of forensic artefacts like cigarettes and chewing gum, adding the DNA from the waste to produce an image how these people might look like.</seg>

<seg id="2136">"they were an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," stated Dewey-Hagborg at a press show of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea, and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>

<seg id="2141">There is now at the opening of the exhibition a somewhat deep and Starke, as Donald Trump leads to war against informant from the governmental camp and against transgender-troops to find new, tweetened ways in order to defends the rigid divisions, which he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg has been asked for the strange Timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a given reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one on the wall of the Gallery depicted artistic statement called Manning with its oversized subordinating among them (the "i" in their family name, attached with a heart) an end to "automatic fragmentation, the basis of gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousands of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped, through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or Nukleotide after the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist) to show how amazing similarly, at least in biological sense, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully join us is that our genome does not take care of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video-work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also visible.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in an own room is a page from above mentioned Comic Novelle.</seg>

<seg id="2374">Over the past months the past few months has been disputed about the future of the race cruttles - now it should be very fast.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Even before the end of the year, the route is said to be built on which the tourist path goes, built.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In order to secure the future of the race in the long term, according to the transport of the Ministry of Transport, this year will begin to work on the route.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"with the decision to further order and sanction the route Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country belongs to this especially for tourism important connection," said Traffic secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The costs for the maintenance of the route was at about 2.5 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="2379">From this sum, the country overtake 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2380">The contract, on whose basis the shuttle will also be ordered in the future of the country, I am going to be finally adapted, stated Sühl.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of Sex-robot is real and we should worry</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it cannot be any crazy this year, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently published the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we have to start to take their Ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye colour of the robot, its form of nipple, and the type of Fingernagel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make themselves funny, but the companies deliver a lot more often and we will see them much more frequent," "" "said Mr. Sharkey in the release of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern SexXlips have developed from its inflatable partners to robots with a Silicone foreskin which feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved through artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs, "and select everything from the eye of the robot to the form of the nipples, until the type or colour of his fingers.</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it becomes more worrying because many robots had the" "" "personalities who would like a stepford-wife progressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern SexXlips have developed to robots with a silicon skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealTotix robot allows for example to customize its users to adapt their robots to the qualities they appealing, such as relaping.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still the True Companion developed Roxxxy Gold Sex robots with pre-programmed personalities as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of pupike and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality to be adapted to your personality as good as possible," "" "Heze the website of True Companion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So may they like what you like, and she does not like what you like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">During the day she also has her moods - quite like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "it can be tired, be fixed on conversation or it can be" "" "in mood!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many troubling aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the interprettious female properties, when one goes a step on Frigid (means here: resumpy) Farrah is going on most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website compromised True Companion Roxxxy with a VIBRATOR, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a VIBRATOR, why do men then don't have a Roxxxy?" it says on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not only a fetish or just a different sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their origin and increasing refinement point to something darker and lowering in our culture to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course keep no sex robots, and while the FRR remarked its rising popularity, they still stay provisional on the edge of consumption.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what comes out of the edge-zones, can be in terms of the spirit of time, in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange, or insulting, until they the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is however some exaggeration that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House that has spared women to be sexually attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The abominous aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the Magd ') are not the graphic images, the devoured body and the engraved eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots consists in creating a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with Pornostar-proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, to the point when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots are not real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">You cannot separate or walk away from her companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no placement or a background history, nothing, which could hinder on independence or anything, which could interfere the fantasy of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are counterfeit slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the phrase of 2017: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Mumps great achievement?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of a healthy man.</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a binder of Trump era that polishing the political divisions, which have polarized the U.S. voters, also families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and harvest feast, there were in the US newspapers with advice about how to deal with horror of Trump relative.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all allegedly supposedly put us all supposedly for our filtering.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of mumps, families to come together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this, because my cousin, a left-aligned poet, who lives in Chicago and has long worked with the Republicans in our family, who visited this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows them, including the Republican relationship with which she had fought for decades because of the politics, suddenly and quite peculiar at the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">To the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it falls me in another connection that this also involves significant risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by trump but the intending effect of his presidency has the power to push us all towards right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "if we speak of" "" "normalization" "" "and Trump we refer to the creepy possibility that we cannot prevent us from one day to another day." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">"" "however, there is a still frightening long scenario in which trump Republicans of the right wing" "", "which suddenly appears in comparison with its standards as a term of denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself today of an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urcomic version of the resignation - the dog on the Autodach, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return notice) - both in comparison to Trump in fact occur one to be very mild offences.</seg>
<seg id="2438">If Trump is to be the next candidate of the Republican only be spiritually healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousins in the city was, we brought our children to Karussell in Central Park, the biggest of the Karussells of New York Parkdepartment, and the best three dollars, which one can spend in the city, if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are kicking and the animals are revolve in order to look with fear about their own shoulders - extremely finsters and the clicked music is conveyed this in significant way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many Klischees of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings are old, the Skylines are becoming familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Twenty-five years later, and I'm still not quite happy about the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the themes ePub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in northern London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">But the Central Park-Karussell is still a strange experience, since two two year old, a 11 year-old and two women can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have been able to evaluate the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked him afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before taking my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to complete the rating with a 15% gratuity - this to buy something about the shop.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This leads not only to a slowing of what actually should be a neutral exchange, but also exerting pressure on the server to a personality in a situation where no need is required.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study maintains exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable state which affects some 1.3 million and in the UK 300,000, creates gastric powers and bleeding, recurrent or bloody divestments, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those affected are usually come to steer the meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins to contribute to develop immune cells, which promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, declared that immune cells in the intestine patrouts, to ensure that damaging microbes that hide in the food not into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation, are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without being sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too distant in the direction of inflammation, it can result in a inflammatory effect.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cells is found in mice, which carry out a certain bacterium in its initiation.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the builders of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacteriart - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an attached to tryptophan nutrition tolerate food tolerated, less anti-inflammatory, if the same system will also work with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral candidate in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance and found that a group of studies involving such cells had, but another group of the same tribe, which was but separated not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference to do with the intestinal microbiomen of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, who usually live in the gastro-intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The diaries of the mice have found DNA sequences and there were six species that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them infallied with the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they have not developed a gut microbiome and they did not developed this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells were created.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria pertaining to the immune system, the researchers left L. reuteri in a fluid and then led to small amounts of fluid, without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant cells.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-Bericht entlastet Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report about the Missouri Falls, the Pope Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report for the mischial scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisler, spokesman of the reform movement "We are Church," stated after the publication from the former Regensburger bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year brother of the Emeritus Benedikt Benedikt XVI., an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger take their deep regret about their own omissions or their at that time false assessment of the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican" "" "Osservatore Romano" "" "on the other hand criticized that when reporting on violence in Domspatzen is measured with" "" "two things" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"" "" "" "there is no doubt that there would be" "" "shameful and shameful actions" "" "that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the" "" "degree of medial manipulation," "", "said the author of Lucetta Scaraffia, historians and a member of the national Italian Bioethics committee." ""</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of a catholic church as a source of all evils is already part of the day-day experience and is preparing the public opinion that will hold it normal" "", "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "also Fürstin Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "" "we are looking forward to the church and this is an unthinkable frescoes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "in addition, she pointed out that in her youth" "" "beats a very normal pedagogical means" "", "to cope with the children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They call it unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on the misuse cases degenerated also pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Quite wrongly, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who with Ratzinger the reminder of "My brother der Pope" written (in 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take" "" "Watzinger in Protection" "", "says Hesemann," "" "for all that had nothing to do with him," "" "he adds the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is written in the 440-page report, which presented by the diocese in Regensburg with the educative lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were used in between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high Plausibility" victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it says to Georg Ratzinger, who was working from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "summing up, so that I was applied by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and mental violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with a high level of Emotionality, the brightness was able to compensate for the students even more disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Yet contrary to numerous other defendants, that many victims were assassed the general humanity of R., and therefore in many cases, despite violence even a positive memories connect with it. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann, why the final report about the misuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger of his opinion has been discharged.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-Pages report on the "Preferences of Non-violence against the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a conflicting picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">For one set out many students his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist, who became hand-gritous when a Domspatz has not brought a top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate as its biographer this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: when one gets the effort and read the whole 440 pages long story from the front to the back, one must ask yourself rather, why the name Georg Ratzinger is found at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is dedicated to eight pages just once and he is clearly acquitted from any suspicion of the mid- or co-wiss in the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The non-violence at the preschool took place outside of its sphere of efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can take it out, too late to experience or have taken first announcements seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the forecasting school, on which he was real, was felt by practically all respondents than - so literally -" "" "salvation" "", "" "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">So also the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also describes an excellent, "knowledgeable," "knowledgeable," and "understanding," an extremely good-natured teacher who served the guys regularly with cakes, biscuits and Bonbons, and "always confiscated by the grapes of children.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and its high emotionality, which already led to Wutauserupted too.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he was not only cast with chairs and threw the keys and bowed on the ground, but also earmarks, and all too cheeked guys moved to the hair or ears, he has given themselves earlier years ago, deeply regrets and excused for them.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The honour of his honor must be noted, however, that such delivery methods in the fragile time, the 1960s and 1970s have been common, while parents like with teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also have such breeder methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Naturally, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">Even I have seen it in a worldly school, a state-Gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared with what actually goes in this report, namely the rectionable sexual abuse and the non-violence at the preschool, are the freighting dredels.</seg>
<seg id="2926">We asked yourself if it was not likely to do with his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedikt XVI. to do that many media has just fell upon him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian pope there are many who have never understood him, still freezing.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth however is: the report entlastet Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, the report has been very much informed about the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger in the final report also contain any execution or co-operation with regard to sexual abuse of the load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clear no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual overgrips claims to have entrusted the domain master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never wondered to speak with my father or my mother about it," "" "said a subject of subject for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">"" "" "" "the true problem in educating sexual abuse and is to be silent on the issue." ""</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral leader, who still would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do you judge the Domspatzen-student Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: an questionable student formulated it: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see any case, in the well-being (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely insights and could have the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd, to embrace that with him... Bubbles or more clear or more likely to have opened, as compared with their parents, dormitory boards, Trust instructors etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that the student and / or their environment attained them could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">What sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore freaked about every fellow-speaking.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus it cannot be thrown out, not prevent it or brought to the display.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these contradicting crimes, as unfortunately it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media was much of" "" "non-violence" "" "in the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is thrown in the report" "" "Find" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge melange from sexual abuse and nonviolence and somewhere, in the middle of George Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is precisely the abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Thus, there will be clean separate: between preschool and the grammar school of Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and non-violence, we say once, other incidents.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral leader of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrible test pedagogik, the cases where Knaben from sadistic teachers were indicted and maligned, and among them decomposed, unoccupied himself at the preschool in Etterzhausen und Pielenhofen, where really skandalous states have to have prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those who had nothing to do with Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, because he got the boys only when they were already at the forecasting school.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On it was like the most witnesses stress the topic "preschool" tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2955">You were only happy to be able to get her out and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the forecasting school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there is still discipline, but it is not a sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And that is also true for Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that "many victims were assassed the general humanity of R., and therefore, in many cases, despite violence even a positive memories connect with it."</seg>
<seg id="2959">So most of the accusation still remains.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods when reported by the state at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and from the events at a school which he was not working and responsible (so the witness) wanted nothing to hear, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Castle Georg Ratzinger systematically in front of the states consistently?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengthasia that the report even reproduces.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "he points out that in the preschool, the test will continue to be practised." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in the light of the risk of negative press, he recommended the ability to advance.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was of course at a time when legal clarity existed, when examinees were also banned in Bavaria for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before, it occurred in a legal gray area, as everybody knows of us at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate it, where people might be exaggerated or drafted, and where really the permissible limit had been crossed.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can not say it, he would have always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">In 1980 the examines of schools were officially established in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said yes, it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the damaging time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we are talking to historians as of the "parstrick of anachronism," thus the danger to present it's moral standard for today's moral standard.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse at all times and also not for what was broken in preschool for resistance and violence in innocent prawns, which is already far beyond that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">It's all quite awful and I am glad that it is finally afflicated.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take the protection of Georg Ratzinger, for all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishment, so earcheers and ears are drawn to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">As a physical radiance then he was strictly forbidden to adhere strictly to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Which image of his Regensburger time has given George Ratzinger because in the talks with you for the book 'My brother of Pope'?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the issue check back on to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, told his perspective as played the Domspatzen only a secondary role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I am not at all concerned that he carried a stricter regiment.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But that must also be said: without this perfectionist, without the undemanding unconditioned discipline, it would probably have been possible to form an institution of world-known Regensburger Domspatzen an institution of world-transports, true cultural message in Europe and his musical tradition, which went to the U.S. twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and bonbons alone you don't even make a huge vocalist and in front of every success, just in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people do you have experienced George Ratzinger during the talks to her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hatzemann: by working on the book and in addition I have experienced George Ratzinger really well over and over again as wonderful, humorous, livelihood, deep believing, and hearty, from which one could not imagine that he could do just a fly of something.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I come regularly with how many former Domspatzen are still today, 23 years after its Emergence, regularly contact him, visit him - he is almost blind - and how to treat it as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not given him up to this day is therefore strictly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are today thankful to him today that he enhances their lives and brought to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a stricter father, certainly, that may be - but still a lovable respect she was still looking for and buried them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clear: everything you are prethrows are guardian methods that were then on the agenda at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overcome this time ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, just because it is prominently and still has an even prominent brother to make the medial scapegoats.</seg>
<seg id="2996">That is the nasty intention, which is behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Because the report that has just been published, relieved him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the decency area would be a 93-year-old man who acquired great merits and without the outside Bayerns and probably no one would know yet the Regensburger Domspatzen would finally be taken into peace.</seg>
