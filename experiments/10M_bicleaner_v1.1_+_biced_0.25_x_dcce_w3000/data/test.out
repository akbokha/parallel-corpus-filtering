&quot; I myself do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honestly speaking , these things are more likely to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger won a bit more variety with a few colleagues on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CHI@@ O : &quot; Golden Sport@@ se &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes , the horses rec@@ alled their ceremony , they hunting in fast Gal@@ lop in their house to the feed @-@ ins .
a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and there@@ with the riding career ended up again and again .
on Saturday , Germany was best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament tables - again close to horses .
he didn &apos;t let himself do with his family about the installation of AL@@ RV on a horse he didn &apos;t take it to photographs .
for a long time this was the first time in Aachen , and thus also on CHI@@ O .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid gave the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small g@@ ala in the Golden pyramid .
at awards there is no li@@ ke@@ able ath@@ l@@ ete .
Bundes@@ betra@@ sta@@ kreu@@ z , Silber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already judged him .
langer is the 18th prize winners of the pyramid .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a great deal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for she is not only awarded for sport@@ y successes but also for social engagement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger promotes the offspring .
and so he gave the prize money from 25,000 Euro to the same .
with 15 more outstanding sports athletes , the second time @-@ master Masters was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports . &quot;
among the excellent includes the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , der Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard G@@ ien@@ ger , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ derer Frank Wien@@ e@@ ke , the Jud@@ ner Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um der Hand@@ b@@ aller Erhard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sport@@ y people came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part hi@@ ked the illustr@@ e society into the spr@@ ing@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ azza price ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held a distance of the great animals .
Clin@@ ton and T@@ umps in economic policy : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and to prevent the TT@@ P trade agreement - we want both Clinton and tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately the two US presidential race are however in the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic demand . &quot; &quot; &quot;
differences in the economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosoph@@ ical difference .
the , on the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt rather small and war@@ ns how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regul@@ ators .
Clinton wants to pun@@ ish the economy to death and regulate death , he says .
by contrast it would be quite different , claims Tr@@ ump .
he will massi@@ vely go on regul@@ ators , and he is strong for a wide @-@ ranging tax reform with lower tax rates - for private professionals and for companies .
Clinton also says : the state has certain duties to fulfil its dis@@ advant@@ aged chances and needs money .
that is why the taxes would increase to the rich , she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
in the times , Tr@@ ump and Clinton are almost wor@@ t@@ equal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democratic candidate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War . &quot; &quot; &quot;
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ national tea wing of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans .
so they could have no internal discussions yet .
significant are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump is to build cohesion power plants and to drive cohesion funding in the US again .
oil production should also be possible in so far shel@@ tered areas , the Paris Climate Protection Agreement wants to cancel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton against their investment programme explicitly wants to strengthen the renewable energies and challenges : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of the clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be China , Germany or America - I want it to be &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far away from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ azi@@ on@@ ical trade deal , both do not want to sign .
but at the same time , both the US do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply to protect American jobs better .
the should then also be better paid , demands about Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a fam@@ ine .
it wants to increase her on 15 dollars a hour .
what Tr@@ ump to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says , the minimum wage must flow , then he says , he should not be changed .
however , the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand stands Tr@@ ump to boost the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics point to him , so that the budget defic@@ it would only be bigger .
on the other hand Clinton , who wants to ask at least from the rich people that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution .
flight : &quot; any woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who fle@@ e alone almost to everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refu@@ ge .
there are four women in a large kitchen .
each has a baby at the most one year old .
one has placed her little son in the arms .
he sho@@ cked with big eyes in the room .
his mother is star@@ ched on the table @-@ top .
until they notice that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and k@@ issed the little ones .
the scene works normally .
till you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is a business leader of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor for social relief offers in Bavaria , and deals with the issue of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are dec@@ eived .
they live in the Mün@@ chner north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised housing for children and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made up the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and Mün@@ chner Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
unfortunately , it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - also not as visitors .
the exception is a w@@ ax@@ y in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ation to say : every woman who arrives here has made his own experiences with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men fle@@ e because of wars because they become politically persec@@ uted , because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them to be a hop@@ eful winners in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women , other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many ste@@ al diff@@ ers away because they cannot see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their home , they have experience with sexual violence , compul@@ sion , honor of honour , slavery or tw@@ rit@@ ing stitution .
this is driving them away .
on the run goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ g for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not a rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
who believe that the end as soon as they occur in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr .
even here the women @-@ standing women would often consider in refugee camps often than inf@@ eri@@ or and worse , too ab@@ used .
this leads to that about 90 percent of women living in Munich &apos;s accommodation , trau@@ mati@@ zed , it appreci@@ ates them .
&quot; some of the children cannot be created voluntarily . &quot;
many women are so familiar to that they have nothing to say .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t trust in speaking openly about the experience , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often do not cure , they need more accommodations only for them , calls B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven District govern@@ ors are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question whether from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , some with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is something that has not been shel@@ tered within the governments of the governments .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ians , women are not moved apart , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press spokes@@ man of the government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , sub@@ - and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken , there are some common accommodation floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is ra@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the Committee on Women &apos;s Women and Gender Equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men apart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study that was published for the committee , it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated apart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; missing the privacy or will men and women accommod@@ ated together , it can be - more appropriate - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the laundry rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , stands in the study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much the women feel this Guardian can be felt at the And@@ ender that puts it on the house in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has spoken around , we have a long queue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily do a second house .
Assist@@ enz@@ ologists st@@ acker : demands for new working policies
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dep@@ uty director of assist@@ ants have called their union to maintain new working policies in their dispute regarding a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( b@@ ma ) has requested its entire Council to gain more labour @-@ measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said , that it would face minister to address the concerns regarding the contract .
assistant doctors and medical students have been agreed in July about the ref@@ us@@ al of a contract that was agreed with the b@@ ma .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday on Thursday , said the president of the J@@ DC cub@@ its , that the government was &quot; persistent &quot; to have problems , which resulted in that the contract was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given the J@@ DC Board , the proposed new contract is completely diver@@ ted to reject the proposed new treaty and asks official re@@ negotiations for all these concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Management Board today provided a formal application for a special meeting of the b@@ ma Council to start a running programme of escal@@ ating labour , which starts in early September .
the disputes arising that Assi@@ stance in this year Six@@ sm@@ al st@@ acker , the first total accidents in the history of the N@@ HS .
the Manager of the b@@ ma Assi@@ stance Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana joined the choice of rejection of the agreed agreement conditions , which were advised by the b@@ ma .
he shared b@@ ma members during the sessions that were still held before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 Assi@@ aries and Medi@@ z@@ inst@@ u@@ dents , with that the treaty was beneficial and should be accepted .
after the vote of the Health Minister , Jerem@@ y Hunt , that the contract for physicians in England would be part of the party .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended up a crisis .
leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to release his hands and pro@@ claim an official end for the eight months of long @-@ lasting war of words and economic sanctions .
but as Vladimir Putin his Turkish counter@@ player in the g@@ ild@@ ed room of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in reception , I cannot des@@ perate to the im@@ print , that Ankara wants to love this reconciliation .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile un@@ alli@@ ed and he felt very little warmth , even for its cau@@ ti@@ ous relationships .
Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an on the other hand spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report full of five times .
I could not count it anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old levels before the crisis , but to improve themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next day described a newspaper that Erd@@ og@@ an had heard that as if it had never been worse .
my enthusiasm seemed to interpret rather the opposite .
but one of Putin @-@ radi@@ ant , sustainable perfection showed that the State of Russia had nothing to forget .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first , what he mentioned in its intro@@ duc@@ tory period : the down@@ ing of a Russian figh@@ ter plane at the Syrian border with Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was wast@@ ed .
Putin shared and accused Ankara , Russia to be fallen into the back .
the failure was even bigger , as it was committed by a supposed friend .
the ve@@ to restore will be difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
months Lang , the nation@@ ally controlled media conducted a severe , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at once it seemed like the Tur@@ ks for everything to blame .
on the most serious , the accus@@ ations of the officials that Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s own family benef@@ ited from il@@ licit oil trading in areas of Syria , which controlled by the so @-@ called Islam@@ ist state .
he has disp@@ uted this veh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin from the President Erd@@ og@@ an received the accus@@ ation he wanted to hear .
Russia could make a kind of victory .
for Ankara the advantages of a ceas@@ ef@@ ire clear on the hand .
Erd@@ og@@ an needs first and foremost all friends that he can get after last month with a failed coup d coup d was be@@ aten in almost his ministry .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey also have sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number is decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia travel operators and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated when flights are res@@ umed .
you count on a delay of the rush of the Mediterranean Sea .
this week projected the state @-@ off cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imports will be restored once more .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti form@@ ulated it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry on the West as it was the reaction to the tried to take power of power as a weak answer .
to this end , the persistent Gro@@ ll come across the sn@@ ail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the ext@@ end@@ ent to move out of cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West .
the Russian leader won in Ankara with security a bonus that he sought after the prosec@@ ute support for the elected state organs .
this is well @-@ evident for Moscow , that itself has a profound fear of reg@@ im@@ e@@ ism .
the summit in this glorious palace at the seaside allowed the Russia and Turkey as it was a anal@@ ysts once described , &quot; alliance of an out@@ sider &quot; : two countries who come across from the West and would now feel badly addressed .
nevertheless , in spite of public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two ones .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support them .
it could be signi@@ fying that after almost three hours on initial talk , both Presi@@ dents were told on the press conference , that they didn &apos;t even compreh@@ end the issue .
the president of Turkey failed to respond to a question about their differences , while Putin decided to empha@@ size this .
there is no clear consensus on what a common denomin@@ ator can be found towards Syria .
but after months of open host@@ il@@ ities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disp@@ aster , when NATO &apos;s member is collap@@ sing the Russian figh@@ ter - it is certainly better that the two leaders have at least talking to one another .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
the R@@ BS brand is said to be reduced to a back@@ office role , according to the Bank &apos;s stand@@ point .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
ROSS Mc@@ E@@ wan divided the BBC Scotland with that the brand R@@ BS joined the Bank &apos;s global ambitions .
the Bank has ever dist@@ anced itself when it was almost k@@ oll@@ ed and saved eight years ago .
in this time brand str@@ apping &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands .
it supported international sport with millions of pounds for sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don champion Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has chosen to put more national brands into the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only for customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all r@@ s@@ b references , the de@@ centralized head@@ quarter and the stock exchange to Nat@@ West will change .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for the private customer business that will get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
he divided the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand r@@ s@@ b will be at our Invest@@ ors &apos; brand and the brand that our employees will be busy , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot;
when the Bank became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am now saying that we do not pursue a global targets , but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different , and our employees will work under these marks with the customers .
R@@ BS has already stated that it will no longer continue his six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase percep@@ tic@@ ability of different brands in his sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop the brands of brands , for how do we focus within ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the fore@@ front .
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical three years ago , if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can set these marks again , so I think that the time has come .

Dett@@ ori spra@@ yed champagne after a double with New@@ market , which takes advantage of the 3,@@ 000@@ ten prize
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie Dett@@ ori was placed on Friday his 3,@@ 000@@ ten British profit at New@@ market .
he sat on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone .
the 45 @-@ year Itali@@ ans is the sixth place @-@ ho@@ ckey which reached the milestone in the flat races .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son .
the three @-@ month winner Dett@@ ori , who previously won at G@@ hay@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it is going to happen at New@@ market because I &apos;m still working here 30 years ago .
it is not a big meeting , it is not a Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
Dett@@ ori takes the rejo@@ ic@@ ing when he wins the victory on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the Hinder@@ er race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the re@@ ver@@ sion@@ ed 20 @-@ painting winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 vic@@ tories in a recru@@ iting career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the ninth Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger I had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of the modern age and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone just a few before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect that distingu@@ ishes it from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic Ambassador to race , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma are enthusiastic over for years for this sport .
I told Frank@@ ie just a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already won 6,000 prizes , if he would not just a weekend and big tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie hat has ri@@ dden nearly 30 years of winners in the UK , which is great .
he has a vibrant personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie Dett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Fl@@ ying Dis@@ mount
from Fl@@ ying stimulate to Fl@@ ying Dis@@ mo@@ unts , Frank@@ ie Dett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of British flat races for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a whole range of big tur@@ ni@@ ers , including his famous &quot; glorious Si@@ eben &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug .
three years ago he had the beginning of trouble when he returned from his six @-@ month block@@ ers , but he showed an impressive characteristic to def@@ ying its branches and to return to its continu@@ ance .
and he is still not in the end - Dett@@ ori has said that he wants to continue with competitions until his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years .
Russia Putin feu@@ d Stab@@ ili@@ ef Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin has released his Stab@@ ili@@ zer Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of the nar@@ ro@@ west confidence source of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old became appointed for the special officers for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , it is that Putin without st@@ ating reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dism@@ iss@@ al Ivan@@ ov@@ s arranged by his duties as Chairman of the Russian presi@@ dential Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been Ivan@@ ov@@ s since 2012 was appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at .
1972 in the Est@@ onian capital city of Tallinn , he made his gradu@@ ated at the renowned State Department of Moscow International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it is ( in Russian ) , that he later was a log and boss of the government leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; about his appointment he said to Putin , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a state of state , and checks controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV Channel on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and advised V@@ ain@@ o as its successor .
convincing the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest confidence Vladimir Putin and works like it for the Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB .
as the St@@ ef , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men said that the St@@ ef ref@@ ra@@ ils down on his own wish .
but despite the surface for cameras , here are only a few of them convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so here is the consequence of a kind of power @-@ match ?
this is currently no one .
but the official statement - that a man who was once challenged as a potential president , to once of the Russian environmental policy - came across great sc@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism .
in his remarks on Putin , who are quot@@ ed on the website of the Krem@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov &quot; it is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - to trust four years .
as it turns out , I have been the chairman of the Russian presi@@ dential administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .

Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing : bridge now with Fi@@ fe connected
the £ 1,35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017
engineers have joined the Nord@@ deck of the Queens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the vi@@ adu@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now associated with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four con@@ cluding the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to approach each of the three towers of the bridge each of the three towers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tr@@ aps of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 ton .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , and 46 tra@@ its parts .
the £ 1,35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister Minister Keit@@ h Brown appointed a visit today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the que@@ ferry cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of a truly craft of a truly ep@@ ic degree in this project with over 30.000 ton concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the link between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the Br@@ ück@@ ende@@ ck is a sensitive activity that will require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
altogether , nearly 79 % of the total lo@@ op@@ ies are at their place and the last part of Dec@@ ks is today in Ros@@ y@@ th an actu@@ ation for the deck , which means the entire Deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to his place .
Michael Martin , Project leader of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in each of the bridge .
in this fantastic project the con@@ sortium is pione@@ ering high and low @-@ construction .
after installing the last road section and its connection with the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the existing gap on the North or country side .
this was reached by pul@@ ling the northern state of 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive , since the vi@@ adu@@ ct is 222 m long , approx . 6,000 tons weighs and a slope of about 3 % to be drag@@ ged .
hei@@ g@@ ust , as the toler@@ ances , on which the team works , win@@ ty were - on each side they dec@@ ayed only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be alive in life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be in life after they were thrown into the fishing boats of fishing boats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI lif@@ ebo@@ at was on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST alarm , after having watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulties in security to swim , while their boat moved on from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around itself around itself and presented us the worst before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank@@ fully , the strong winds of the boat is already speaking out of its reach , until we left water &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , during the third man at the age of 60 exhausted and found at a ram without life@@ jacket .
they all arrived on board the coastal bo@@ ots and were brought back to the lif@@ ebo@@ at station
Mr Jones said , &quot; The three men that were thrown into the water were fortunate un@@ viol@@ ated and still alive .
the boat @-@ engine had a emergency one , this cle@@ av@@ ed however at the ken@@ tern of the bot of the person who ste@@ ered the boat .
someone has awak@@ ened today about these men today .
difficult wo@@ unded - man sticks for his ex @-@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and badly inju@@ red .

the police could take the perpet@@ rators .
during the 50 year @-@ old the clothes of his ex @-@ friend was destroyed , he called his mother .
this alarm@@ ing as a result of his sister .
together with their partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm their brother .
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
therefore she went with their partner out of the house .
on the road they met the ex @-@ style of the man .
when the two women mar@@ ry again the apartment , the h@@ ub@@ ar@@ est of the 50 @-@ year @-@ old his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ friend .
who builds a uns@@ ett@@ les favourable apartments ?
the SPD and Gre@@ ens mean , investors will continue to be taken much more closely in the future .
how does one react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose nearly 1300 apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD is propos@@ ing to next R@@ ats@@ session a &quot; tow@@ el concept &quot; in front of .
but dispute is programm@@ ed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who is supposed to build the favorable apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Green Party : who wants to build on urban areas in future , must show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the affordable housing prices can also be found in its continu@@ ance .
the big dispute point in the city hall is , however , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do we work with investors who want to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to be at least 10 percent in such areas , but as 20 percent of apartments as a social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new municipal housing product range that will cost millions and must still be financed , should provide incentives for incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few as possible .
the left is still hoping for investors .
regardless of its , Brat@@ mann , bah@@ t itself is a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the market .
the manual concept is implemented , that will provide additional tasks in the administration office .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the professionals .
but still the program is not completely : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments should be built anyway .
but how does one compare the loss of other about 1300 cheap apartments , which is going to run over the next few years ?
only up to 2020 there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this as the plan @-@ policy spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , should now buy @-@ current ties of the city .
moreover , we would have to be thought to get apartments back into the pricing .
this is possible in the West town .
at one stroke the problem will be solved .
because in the west town the dates are running for the end of the period .
around 1800 apartments you could get there back in the price @-@ binding for cheap apartments .
only : this would not want the owners , the housing corporations .
because the number of social housing in the west town is again dra@@ stically significant , one is removed from the target of so @-@ called mixing .
there is no longer a concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens reck@@ on that there will be even more movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; leader of the Vice @-@ president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a wide majority the CD@@ U must have to go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has concentrated on more construction sites for family homes .
but what does not mean that not yet another compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
that te@@ ens and child are no longer going to go outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time , to rigi@@ d on scre@@ ens , has been shi@@ fted over the last decade of many .
at Pok@@ emon Go it &apos;s about to get people out of the sofa and be more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then to video games and last on smartphones .
it is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mut@@ ually exclusive .
I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that was created on the characters that first created for Vide@@ osp@@ iel@@ e in the 1990s ( later emerged from a character series , game cards and other spin @-@ off ) .
like many phenomena of the Pop@@ ular Front , interest in the publication of the game is recorded in the U.S. , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the market launch in other countries was moved by massive demand that over@@ loaded the server .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players agree with their smartphone and look for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons , who are tr@@ acked with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( over a screens@@ hot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the search from the sofa .
in the United States , the game introduced a considerable rise in steps which re@@ moves the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
Car@@ di@@ ogra@@ m , an App for Apple Watch , the 35.@@ 000 users announced , the Washington Post recently concluded that within two days of launch of the game , the number of succ@@ essive people followed each day 30 minutes by train , by 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company doesn &apos;t know who does the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only looks the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns to health , people want to take &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes time &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; getting to be active every day , because many public messages are more boring and to come by people who look like . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be over@@ rated .
those who regularly drives sport reduces its odds , to become cancer or depression .
physical activity helps with the weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful at Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun .
some people are even closing new friends on the hunt .
as always there are m@@ ab@@ omet@@ ric players who always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what should &apos; s ?
it has made a breakthrough .
even though smartphone apps like Fit@@ Bit could follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to drift sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its charm and use it with time .
due to poker success , however , there will be more games to be able to unite the apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world , thereby being able to help many people on the hunt , active , fit@@ ter and healthier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the chamber
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is at all the imm@@ un .
dynam@@ ically on the spr@@ ing@@ horse .
ef@@ fort@@ less on the beam .
stunning on the floor .
on gan@@ zer line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympi@@ ad .
the 19 @-@ year American Tur@@ ner@@ in kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday towards the multi @-@ kamp@@ ft@@ it@@ el and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spot@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the Silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ als@@ sk@@ ir@@ amer@@ adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze winner of Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the Americans who play Simone Bil@@ es burned on the pig @-@ bal@@ ken during the individual multi @-@ shift work during the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American she wins a multi @-@ kamp@@ ft@@ it@@ el and a total of the fifth , while they are stuck to its reputation , the best of their generation or even ever .
it broke out in tears when the end result was shown and her long journey was found at that moment .
this success presents them in the same League as unique athletes , such as Michael P@@ helps who have brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es the last three years have domin@@ ates its sport , 15 World Championships - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises , that the Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ ress from 1984 Mary Lou bail@@ out of her said that she &apos;s &quot; the best Tur@@ ner@@ in , that I have ever seen . &quot;
there was a final examination in Brazil , a competition , which went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas back , would be regarded as disappointment .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace after they each won gold and silver in the watch@@ making of women at the Olympic Summer 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday ,
Bil@@ es got the first med@@ al on Tuesday , while they were standing on the f@@ are@@ well @-@ party of their ever @-@ standing Mann@@ als@@ sko@@ ordin@@ ators in Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a footh@@ old .
although it insi@@ sted that during their long way to go to the top , never the future is planned , it is not really true .
part of their exercises which include their typical Tum@@ bling pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was trained by coach A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school trip to Turn@@ halle , in which Bo@@ or@@ man worked , has become effective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has no longer been lost since the summer of 2013 , a se@@ perate series , which will last as long as it wishes to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even if Must@@ af@@ ina led by two rot@@ ations , light led the picture .
Schwe@@ be@@ bal@@ ken and Bod@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen - in which Bil@@ es keeps the world @-@ master@@ y - secluded .
she returned again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the swe@@ eping @-@ beam back - and set up with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground yet another .
Ra@@ is@@ man um@@ im@@ pover@@ ished it gently when she expected her grand@@ son - a pure form of form@@ ality - and tears flow on Bil@@ es sh@@ iny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , when the vision that it was once described in its collection @-@ book .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medals in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke to Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team @-@ cap@@ ers , which is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after its ground @-@ exercise , she cast to the audience Kus@@ sh@@ ank , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that sometimes du@@ bi@@ ous appeared .

police : 3 victims in serial waste in the music stream in the car
according to police report that were published on Thursday two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot in one of the deadly attacks from Phoenix for a decade in the first series of mass mur@@ derer , while they stopped their car and listened to music .
Angela Rochelle Lin@@ er , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in an entry , said the authorities .
the k@@ iller fi@@ red eight shots from a handful of fires , while sitting on the passenger side of the car and fled afterwards with another vehicle , is in the report to read .
the police reported that the triple murder did not seem to be the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y over@@ lap because the Att@@ acker doesn &apos;t have the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 took possession of one of the adult victims .
the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting were the investig@@ ators associated with it , a closer look to whether it is connected with four previous attacks .
all in all , predomin@@ antly in His@@ pan@@ ic dor@@ sal were killed in nine months in nine months of up seven persons and two others inju@@ red .
&quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; divided Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , an subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month with .
it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ an from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators devi@@ ate the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and were committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was made hosp@@ it@@ alized because of its injury and died later .
Lin@@ er , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site .
a witness distributed the police with that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was imposed on an empty Pick@@ up truck for half an hour before the three @-@ fold murder and that it is assumed that it was the work of the serial mur@@ derer .
investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a bul@@ let from the seat as well as ball frag@@ ments from the engine space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it becomes better &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old likes Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto das S@@ ingen , toys and of course his mother .
but as the least of his retirement has enjoyed Ed@@ mund micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto during her pregnancy did not know .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought I managed not .
I don &apos;t manage this .
I have not let myself go .
what is not right now -- of course one has left to it , &quot; she said .
her husband Vincent and you have been told that Ed@@ mund may never realize it under circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some physicians even went so far that they proposed to institu@@ tion@@ alise it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not know that people still make , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a assist@@ ants .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit down to his third year , neither sit scratch and he can still not speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
he can run and cycle with support .
he likes to play with his two brothers and sing .
Elizabeth shows the character language that Ed@@ mund for &quot; Please sing me somewhat before . &quot;
&quot; we bring him drawing language at , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical character language -- it says . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses like masks or z@@ ic@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and pro@@ gn@@ oses may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it is to influence the life of the infected with the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
pic@@ ci@@ uto are reminded of the emotional price of a certain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not know .
I did not ask for a progno@@ sis for a long time because I don &apos;t expect that someone can really say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eful rating for mothers of inf@@ ants who were inf@@ eri@@ or caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

on Friday a flood@@ ing system was used on Friday , while it was still ra@@ ining in the area of Mobile .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near D@@ enh@@ am Springs , which are both in Louis@@ iana , are likely to be reached after the weekend &apos;s record .
the Met@@ ere@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could be flood@@ ed many houses in the near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that an hidden flo@@ ods desc@@ ending towards Ascension is a danger , as these are flowing to flow in the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as in the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are awak@@ ened and the water flowing and flowing in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife said Hans@@ ford , that she lived in the 48 years , where she lived there never had such a stron@@ gh@@ old of the river .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members could have all the disabled and he would have the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that Not@@ hel@@ fer had saved all three in a large military truck and they had brought them to the next fire @-@ guard in Glo@@ ster , where they were lod@@ ged until Friday .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flo@@ ods &quot; collap@@ sing &quot; quickly , as there were serious ra@@ inf@@ alls and that the authorities take ev@@ acu@@ ation to take into consideration .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the water starts to go back , they will be able to go back into their houses &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a , almost two d@@ art@@ end roads were provided , due to the flood , and sand@@ bags provided for residents to take part , which hope to keep the water out of their homes and shops .
&quot; the last great flo@@ ods that we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the Munici@@ pal administration .
this seems to be a similar incident .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his small body was penet@@ rated by balls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divided his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores melan@@ chol@@ z on the radio station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can simply not believe .
the condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the family of the boy divided the transm@@ itter that he is expected to recover .
it should have the first class to begin in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
also three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year men is in critical state ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in stable condition .
the boy was placed on the front of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is found in a critical state , found , reported on the transm@@ itter .
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police are determined whether in one of the last men of the perpet@@ rators might be .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems to have come to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ oters .
Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen for Stur@@ m@@ ess hon@@ ors who were trac@@ ed to various over@@ tones , over@@ se@@ wing the Tat@@ ort .
it seems that it is un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally concerned about a lasting battle .
on the road , on both sides of the ear , were sle@@ eves .
in this way , there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; divided police al p@@ mann Anthony Gin@@ aldi of the police in Philadelphia to the transm@@ itter .
several houses and vehicles were taken in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came to no feast and the police are re@@ viewing reports according to the surveillance video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was struck by an cross @-@ R@@ acket which she played in front of her house in the neighborhood of the West O@@ ak Lane .
it recovered and the police are still looking for a susp@@ ects .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine in the role of women in the gymn@@ ast@@ ics and that is more than a reason .
first , I have been playing with every summer Olympics in 1984 and the United States were never so dominant .
and second , this team has three tur@@ ers , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who was inspiring for many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this crew , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din and Ma@@ dison Co@@ cian , the cath@@ o@@ lik@@ in is , round off , makes everyone proud .
this team finally mir@@ rors the US .
it has paved the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was one among the female tur@@ rets a A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year were Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympi@@ ag@@ ew@@ inn@@ in and America .
now the world was able to be able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as she was unexpected , but master@@ ful Gy@@ ma@@ stic routines .
on Thursday Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American she won in an individual multi @-@ election event for women Gold .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are witn@@ essing the top of this sport , but that kind of gym all over the country do not look out .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie schlu@@ gen all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison , to bring it to the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympics are only four tur@@ ers in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is so that Tur@@ ns is a more expensive sport and gymn@@ asts are primarily maintained in private trainers who will be maintained by parents , which are open for training , free clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the co@@ aches and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . the list can be stopped .
the majority of these trainers are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs to support the business .
in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts receive their whole training and that is a good and long @-@ term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , train@@ ee of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , train@@ ee of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both had trained their athletes , since they started with the tur@@ bine .
we have to be inspired by the con@@ greg@@ ations of countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a powerful and easy accessible exercise .
I was founded my Turn@@ stiftung of 20 years .
at my events we have offered free and affordable tur@@ key in Harlem for more than 15,@@ 000 urban youth ( above all black and his@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we are expanding to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ ast@@ ics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
tur@@ key develops strength , flexibility , and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and certainty for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this crew , which bringing the thousands of young girls to be interested in the tur@@ bine and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is a so exciting time .
thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this genuine presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; through the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team and thanks , F@@ ass will motiv@@ ate her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to get healthy , strong and successful young women .
Assist@@ enz@@ ologists want to organize other strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y H@@ unts proposal
the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the functioning of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.000 wi@@ z@@ arians who voted on a election , rejected him .
in July , Hunt had revealed plans to introduce the contract in part and said that the N@@ HS had become harmful within a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and any further delay on employees and patients would be harmful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first aid doctors should receive a new contract that contains changes to night and weekend trips in order to improve the care of odd watch times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the b@@ ma com@@ mander held last night in a communication with : &quot; assistance veter@@ in@@ arians joined the proposed treaty in particular , particularly that it is the current availability crisis and administ@@ ered it to treat all doctors well . &quot;
at only eight weeks that remain even until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract , progress must be made and time goes out .
efforts from the b@@ ma to solve the dispute caused by conversation with the government to get involved and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this happened of the promise , Jerem@@ y Hunt had only made it last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hunt must act now , take up the pre @-@ condition and address the concerns of the assist@@ ants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he did not do so , it has clearly stated the wi@@ z@@ ins that they are ready to perform further labor measures .
the last strike in late April saw a re@@ plen@@ ishment of almost 13.@@ 000 routine decor@@ ations and 100,000 terminals before , since nur@@ ses and specialist doctors were included to provide doctors on the strike post@@ cards .
the Ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes by an assumption of the re@@ formed contract with the functioning of the British Medical Association .
the b@@ ma wants a better wave @-@ proof for the 5@@ 4,000 Assist@@ enz@@ y who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General dire@@ ktor of the N@@ HS employee , urged the assistance in order to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not achieve a little but over@@ loaded teams and service providers , and prepare their patients , door@@ step , and their families only worry , hard@@ ships and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last two months , we have spoken to the comm@@ ent@@ ee of the assistance personnel and responded positively with the Ministry of Health and other minist@@ ries , responded positively to concerns about the youth and wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ or@@ ings .
employers hop@@ ed that continuing positive commitment on other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training planning , mutual recognition of the cur@@ ri@@ culum , training holiday and the gender @-@ specific wages , education , mutual recognition of the cur@@ ri@@ culum , training holiday and the Ministry of Health concerning compliance with the agreements concluded with the b@@ ma in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ pro Tag@@ li@@ - medication , can reduce heart attack
thousands of heart infectious diseases will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug , after being advised by the authorities to administ@@ er this more people for a longer period .
the regulated medication Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repet@@ itive cardi@@ ac disease for people with a her@@ nia disease .
the drug is already administ@@ ered for 12 months after a heart attack , thus reducing the risk of stroke or any other heart attack .
the regulatory authorities N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS has recommended for a four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regulatory authorities N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS has recommended for a four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
some 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of it suffer another heart attack or stroke .
cardiovascular and stroke will be caused by supplying fatty acids in the arter@@ ies that form a b@@ lows .
when the case breaks out , it may cause a cl@@ ot@@ ting sel that con@@ gest@@ ed the blood flow to the heart and thus causes a heart attack .
when the blood pressure comes off , it may flow through the blood stream and cl@@ oven blood flow to the brain , which causes a stroke .
persons who had already had a heart attack , are subject to a higher risk to further .
Tic@@ mu@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trad@@ ename Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots in@@ likely .
the accus@@ ation of N@@ ICE , which today was released , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , director of the N@@ ICE health promotion centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all those who suffered a heart attack , a further heart attack or stroke - often with disast@@ rous consequences . &quot;
the fear of another heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that ticks are in combination with aspir@@ in , in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing other heart attack and stroke among people who had already had a heart attack .
due to a preliminary recommendation of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to expand capacity options to thousands of people that benefit .
the information on the efficacy and safety of ticks - primarily the blood risk - is restricted to a period of up to three years . the activation design recommends no treatment that goes beyond this time period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ts can blo@@ om election in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man , the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man , was removed from office last year due to corruption from office .
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ts has led to that the common election was ignor@@ ant in Muslim communities , like a crus@@ hing government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Cab@@ inet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric Pic@@ kles re@@ ver@@ bal the police , sp@@ rou@@ ter and Town H@@ alls to have ignored evidence of elec@@ toral abuse due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; survival abuse due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; survival abuse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former minister of integration and communal government , that now is an anti @-@ corrupt regime , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious mot@@ if@@ s were so bad that the police should be allowed to set up break@@ out tap@@ es outside of the elec@@ trol@@ ley in order to infl@@ ated voters .
he recommended that voters should lead a reference to prove their identity in elections .
at present , a vot@@ er must name its name and address .
the report proposes to spread not remot@@ ely ink on the finger of a person when they give their elec@@ toral voice to prevent that someone is chosen twice .
wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers should preserve more protection , says Sir Eric .
he calls for the press to have more access to municipal ordin@@ ances and decisions of non @-@ official comm@@ ent@@ ees or work@@ groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only opposed to elec@@ toral fraud , but should also protect the municipal authorities in front of the broader cor@@ rup@@ tions and financial fraud that protect it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by the Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election campaigns in the east of London .
last year , a special court decided that the official Mayor of Lut@@ fur for Rah@@ man , decided to corrupt the corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the court was that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in z@@ yn@@ ical way , &quot; and that he had hop@@ ed his critics with r@@ attle and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man ought to have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the reli@@ ous duty of Muslims be to vote him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of a im@@ itation in which one person cho@@ oses than someone else .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence in the whole country of fraud .
he expressed particularly alarm@@ ing for fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent brief@@ ing - in older members of the Muslim community pressure on people , to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean up the elec@@ toral system , including the fo@@ ref@@ ine to prove the identity
in his report , it says that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercis@@ ed , especially women and young people to choose according to the Will of El@@ der , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or ban@@ en@@ ic background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions should have ignored such a behavior based on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; survival issues relating to eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations in order to clean the system , including the pro@@ hibition that political activists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elec@@ toral harvest@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , requires also tough@@ er registration tests to prevent the voting directory to im@@ mig@@ rate and social beg@@ ru@@ gs .
options consider taking account of the election according to your reference .
un@@ aware ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has released her voice to prevent that someone is chosen twice .
systematic circul@@ ations on the nation@@ ality of a person to make sure that they are entitled optional .
a thre@@ w @-@ year limitation on applications on a automatic letter .
pro@@ hibition that political activists should deal with full elections and covers in the brief@@ ing .
the police give power to set up work@@ stations around elec@@ trol@@ ess stations .
a legislative change that facilit@@ ates an indic@@ t@@ ment due to inti@@ mid@@ ation according to the Rep@@ res@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( National Represent@@ atives Act 1983 ) .
photographer @-@ ban in elec@@ trol@@ ess stations .
please request that only English can be used in the elec@@ toral stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the staff usually en@@ force that voters are going alone into the elec@@ toral cabin .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing , &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case none has been indic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ toral court has declared Lut@@ on Rum@@ man and his dep@@ uty for due to a lit@@ igation on corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was insufficient for a number of reasons for sufficiently - according to the high demands in the criminal proceedings - guilty .
he also critic@@ izes the effective &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ act@@ ment &quot; of the Elec@@ toral departments of the Town H@@ alls .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the For@@ sur@@ part in Tower Ham@@ lets of last year was a War@@ n@@ signal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country carries a proud heritage than the mother of the parli@@ aments , but the wor@@ rying and covered spread of elec@@ toral and denial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;

except for a double @-@ vessel at the Rad@@ ren@@ n@@ bahn , many people on the internet point out how to be a certain ar@@ cher of the T@@ illing of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Br@@ ady Ell@@ ison has created a rush on Twitter after pictures , on which he looks like the Wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ hei@@ mlich .
in fact , the arch@@ ival got the mad@@ ness in social media with and gave to that he has been hearing already since his childhood , that he looks like Leo .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I am well as compli@@ ment on &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly occur this year : the open simil@@ arity between the British Weit@@ z@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian Tur@@ ner@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with their great , expres@@ sive eyes is said to be a double @-@ singer for the cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .

the comm@@ ent@@ ators &apos; Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze on behalf of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC Cop@@ ter and added his exc@@ use at more than 90 other Twitter @-@ users who had compl@@ ained on the comments made by Mac@@ Donald
the network also ap@@ olog@@ ised fast and gave a communication out .
we deeply regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible that it will be broad@@ cast@@ ed .
we quickly spent yesterday evening at our viewers in the show and our followers in social media .
in order to clear one , B@@ yr@@ on comments relate to the performance of the swi@@ mm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
nevertheless they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate chosen formulation . B@@ yr@@ on does that which he said , are very p@@ ity .
on Thursday morning we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to justify Mac@@ Donald in the show and tried to justify his remark by said that it was not his intention that it is designed as a personal attack .
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after women &apos;s flo@@ ating aff@@ el at C@@ BC Olymp@@ is@@ endung , to ap@@ ologi@@ ze , he said .
&quot; I referred to the performance of the swi@@ mm@@ ers and not upon them as a person . &quot;

buyer in Pri@@ mark is app@@ alled by Mrs who tried in the middle of the shop sch@@ am@@ eless under@@ wear .
the buyers didn &apos;t know where to see it , as a woman with@@ drawn their clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mark to try under@@ p@@ ants .
in order to wor@@ sen the situation , mu@@ ster@@ led them as she saw it , she moved out and put them back into the shelf .
you walk on and tried four pairs of under@@ p@@ ants in a shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping centre in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman tried the sub@@ tro@@ users before they put it back into the shelf
a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , &quot; she went back and left the business without buying something . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the sale area , she took a couple of sub @-@ p@@ ants from the Aus@@ lage , moved their own ti@@ ghts and p@@ ants and tried them up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a little more discreet place to do it - it just stood there , fre@@ ch like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; each rigi@@ d , when she re@@ moves the under@@ p@@ ants that you obviously don &apos;t like it as they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
she reiter@@ ated the same with three other under@@ p@@ ants before she finally decided that you dropped nothing , re@@ moves and depart@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b that she watched someone - or think about the person who would like to buy the under@@ p@@ ants that she tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; as contradic@@ tory to think that someone would take shelter with home , who had a different person and were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
Mrs Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; as I received , the employees tried to pull the clothes pieces out of the sale after it went - which is just as good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ p@@ ants and finding out that another woman she had an@@ gled and out and they were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

if you wake up from behind , you should turn out to be al@@ right , so that you can see your att@@ acker and move out of the line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
grab the weapon then between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before you hit him with your free el@@ bow .
then hit him with the knee into the gro@@ in and rot@@ ate , while the att@@ acker is cr@@ ashed before pain together , the weapon from his hands . hit him with the run and move back@@ wards while they direct the weapon upon him .
when att@@ ackers that approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the line , grab the gun and turn it , so that the att@@ acker can not shoot .
now transfer the weight to the gun and hit the att@@ acker on your chest , then turn the weapon from his grip on before they move back@@ wards and set the weapon upon him .
sound difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it Miz@@ ra@@ chi makes .
but remember that it is on the saf@@ est on the saf@@ est to transfer your money - if you are not a Kra@@ a Grand Master .
Traveler Ian W@@ right scr@@ apes for a guide its tongue at the dirt places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller sub@@ t@@ led his immune system and saus@@ age in a serious investigation - by st@@ ained some of the most cont@@ amination and ec@@ el@@ ar@@ est places of Europe .
the present@@ er and travel agent Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k pic@@ tured his course on a Euro @-@ Sch@@ ein , a Gel@@ änder at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a dishwasher of a train toil@@ ette , as well as a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resi@@ li@@ ency of its immune system .
in front of the c@@ row of each object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to prove and show us what he will have .
but the experiment that was fil@@ tered under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; brought some start@@ ling results to day@@ light .
the thought , dism@@ iss the dishwasher of a train toilet , that has already been used by thousands of others , may be totally detached , but actually located in a kitchen rin@@ se more bad bacteria .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with physicians and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria , as well as his own health .
luckily nothing left nothing , which he le@@ ak , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resi@@ li@@ ence of his intest@@ ines by traveled by the world and ate peculi@@ ar and wonderful things .
from public funds to stations to sink to sink of toilets , the task assigned its immune system definitely among a sample
in the film he told us : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I put all kinds of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms , and bat water . &quot;
in the film he was just addressing his reputation in any case .
the only thing that he sh@@ aded was a dirt public toilet in Russia .
its pro@@ be@@ el showed a L@@ umin@@ ometer value of over 4000 units .
compared to that the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ric count is fresh from less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to le@@ aning off , after their L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ric count was over 4000 units , while fresh hands exc@@ els one of less than 60
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products vali@@ o produced the Reis@@ ef@@ il@@ m &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacteria from different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes to the worst , which I have d@@ ashed in a rest@@ room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing dirt than that !
I will do nothing here because it is in@@ inside .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company is offered by W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us that contains both lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intest@@ inal bacteria and the immune system .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and New categories N@@ iko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer something new .
something that &apos;s fascinating to look for and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we led crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings by saying that we told &quot; Make us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of the gut health and how it is associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , which led the direction of the film , said : &quot; let me tell me so - I would have awak@@ ened my respect for Ian when he had taught me , such as the ek@@ el@@ ty Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things where it was simpler , Ian to bring it to le@@ aks and others where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad that we have made some of these dirty treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in one of Vali@@ o conducted survey conducted by 2015 , 84 percent of all sur@@ vey@@ ed l@@ actic acid bacteria , in particular with the well being of gast@@ ro@@ man and Dar@@ m and 58 percent said that they at least use products that included l@@ actic acid bacteria .

the walls made gl@@ aff@@ able holes on , wooden di@@ elen were picked up , gar@@ bage was scattered upon the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was tasted to the walls .
the family have been res@@ um@@ i@@ ated and it is believed that she is living now in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ voy that works for the house@@ administration at Corn@@ wall Housing , said that they feared that the apartment was no longer be repaired .
she said , &quot; It was a complete night@@ mare for people here and I believe that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider , since this property will probably be regarded as not as beautiful as Corn@@ wall .
the family is in@@ famous and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that inf@@ lic@@ ted the family , street fight with bas@@ eb@@ u@@ eg@@ s , drug abuse , drug trade and excessive scre@@ aming , flo@@ wering and flo@@ ods .
Skel@@ don , 47 whose name was on the le@@ ase , got an arrangement for the iso@@ forms of behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which will be demol@@ ished under circumstances , old gar@@ bage has been found
they were trad@@ ed in the property where drugs were trad@@ ed in the past .
neighbours said that they had to fight it on the road and regularly called the police themselves
Corn@@ wall Housing del@@ o@@ gi@@ fted them and their partners this week by force outside the property after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to ex@@ pose voluntarily .
the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ance were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours that said that their life was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They dis@@ es about anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we are saying the police here are incredible .
&quot; today we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood here , because it was so quiet - we are not used !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that the family had been administ@@ ered with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years
on the over@@ grown side of the common house were tr@@ acked tr@@ ash and old toys .
he added : &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that it l@@ ends the ten@@ ants to take any responsibility for their behavior and to accept her family , as a del@@ e@@ ying is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall Housing will take into consideration .
it was a very difficult case since the behaviour was extremely difficult and they had to look forward their deeds for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the con@@ gregation who have been cour@@ ageous for us and have provided us with the information provided .
I hope that this development will end some neighbors con@@ sol@@ ation and con@@ veys the message that the iso@@ forms of behavior is not toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they all be over 20 .

in 2014 the police conducted a raid in the house and found more than 70@@ g cannabis as well as Wa@@ agen , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alien and cash at the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine ag@@ gre@@ ed after they had found guilty of poss@@ essions of class B in commercial sight .
they said that the money for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don was , who died in 2013 at an automobile accident .
after they were without shelter , it is understood that Tanya and her partners are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
lots of rooms of the house were mixed with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they d@@ enter ten@@ ants , who do not keep themselves in the house order
Angela C@@ row returned by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall that the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ment was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not adhere to the order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can accept themselves without self @-@ speech , as well as those who were damaged by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and ant@@ iso@@ forms that continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities .

last non @-@ Chinese at the top of the podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left on the plate alone , among the sets and in time @-@ outs they had no co@@ aches with him .
they had drawn up on the ble@@ ach@@ ers and left their tr@@ ages in fair competition by each other alone .

Donald Tr@@ ump ″ enormous problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the US rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans is troub@@ led by massive worries , even in traditional conserv@@ atives , their majority .
President &apos;s Donald Tr@@ ump now gave weaknesses of its election campaign to the former Republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg Ut@@ ah .
a rar@@ er moment , in which the usually large @-@ sp@@ uri@@ g and self @-@ confident m@@ ultim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire something like concerns voic@@ ed how correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the own Republi@@ can camp , the doubts expressed his success in the fight for the White House .
&quot; we have huge problems in Ut@@ ah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump against evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for support in important federal states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
gu@@ ilt are false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he again took his known media .
Republi@@ can Hoch@@ bur@@ ns w@@ ack@@ eln
Ut@@ ah is normally a safe bank for the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans .
a survey of Sur@@ vey@@ ors from June , declar@@ es Tr@@ ump and its compet@@ itor of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , equ@@ ated .
other institutes consider Tr@@ ump in front , but not by the distance , which are common for Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
Arizona , and Georgia are valid as endangered in Arizona .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview of the CN@@ BC Tr@@ ump to the question , as he wanted to stop the eve of Clin@@ ton again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as I did so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either succeed , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is doing nothing else than to tell the truth . &quot;
if it &apos;s not rich for him at the end of reasons of political correctness , be it in order , said Tr@@ ump .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to Press@@ eb@@ eri@@ z , the party should be tr@@ ump to submit funds to support its election campaign , he should not present any better survey values .
instead of this , one wants to draw up the candidates of the Republi@@ can for Congress more strongly under the arms .

Kenya &apos;s athletes threat@@ ens under the second d@@ oping affair during the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
after a beg@@ inner @-@ attempt at a d@@ oping control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a trainer home .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the study and the following actions in the I@@ OC will provide an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in a IAAF Declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D@@ oping agency &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had put much pressure on African country in Brazil before the summer to create an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a functioning control system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Bronze beginning .
as a result , W@@ ada Kenya took away from the list of countries whose d@@ oping fight against the rules of the W@@ ada .
Kenya is considered a great runner .
the athletes of the land won the most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Peking .
in a series of television reports , the ARD were raised again and again up@@ grading that in Kenya &apos;s D@@ oping means are easily accessible and there should be a significant ment@@ ality of the sport bet@@ ru@@ gs .

it could be proven that in this sport area cover and systematic ged@@ ly was established .
all of Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer .

we always say that they are very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and mel@@ ody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ eins really in our blood !
in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays an older artist Maria .
she is reminded of melan@@ chol@@ y to their favorite with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dance .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she says it in her song : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel Pret@@ ty , oh so Pret@@ ty , I feel Pret@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it is clever , naturally also nai@@ ve , and very passi@@ on@@ ately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character , whom I as a Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dud@@ amel is full of praise for the operator : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is so a honour for us to work with her .
it is a tremendous gener@@ acy .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back : &quot; Dud@@ amel is so an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
rigi@@ d is for him a necessity .
you see it in any of his movements , in its bub@@ ble , it &apos;s his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a fun approach to life , which is at all very important !
for the American film@@ maker Philip WM . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; top @-@ up : &quot; this piece is about prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ ig@@ ans went to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want them .
it is the same issues and they are just as expres@@ sive as it was then .

in the medium term , there could even be &quot; some hundreds of hundreds , &quot; believes the band@@ leader Ali Top@@ ra@@ k .
due to the hard work of the Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an after the coup attempt the Kur@@ dish community in Germany expects a mass refu@@ ge to Germany .
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with ten thousand , medium @-@ term exam@@ ining from Turkey in Germany when the Erd@@ og@@ an regime is fighting for minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; says the Prime Minister Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; world &quot; of Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government already passed Kur@@ dish in short months ago , some 500@@ ,000 Kurds in Turkey on the run . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the put@@ sch coup , yet sec@@ ular and op@@ ted ethnic Tur@@ ks .
many will want to start in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may not be that a state embr@@ aced by itself refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the band@@ age ad@@ mits the targeted government of Syrian Arab Arabs in Kur@@ dish , but also in Alban@@ ian towns .
so that Erd@@ og@@ an wants to increase the return to the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ian and Greeks have been exter@@ min@@ ated or displ@@ aced in the past hundred years , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member .
the band@@ age requested that the federal government is so sharp as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and his followers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even in Germany a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wit@@ en@@ hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erd@@ og@@ an critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last few months I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len is also the escape of many Tur@@ ks abroad .

as the newspaper reported under vocation by the numbers of the Federal Ministry of Finance , the Tur@@ ks were already in front of the coup , the biggest group of victims due to political persecution recognised in Germany .
on the date of June 30th , it was 11.@@ 386 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all have been entitled to be entitled ( 39.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , there will not be the pre @-@ wage war , poverty or fu@@ tility .

Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it is w@@ aking &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals do not receive nothing from the summer campaigns with - and the holiday makers from North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia may not choose the land day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
2021 the land@@ lady will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the s@@ ine parliament decided already at the beginning of the year .
for more than now it is not : summer holidays , heat , and land @-@ day @-@ fighting cont@@ ests - that is attached .
the locals , who are to be convinced of the campaigns , are on vacation .
most vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on Us@@ edom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so do not choose the day .
to do this , practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , the posters ex@@ pose , ballo@@ ons , flyer , and count on the end of voices even ti@@ rel@@ oll .
until 4 September 2016 , the elec@@ toral and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to come forward before fighting for fighting just in the people .
the hot phase , when you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear of his office .
the SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , is now in surveys clear behind the CD@@ U .
thrilling will be exciting how strong Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D ab@@ id@@ ed and what remains at the end of the condition dust .
cel@@ ering , 66 years of age and since 2008 Prime Minister , makes an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous pol@@ ling campaign , one sees from its great cl@@ as@@ cen@@ aries .
he travels through land , spread Roses and plau@@ si@@ fied a little with the people , just as it did his legendary prec@@ arious predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff .
otherwise , Ze@@ ering has got k@@ old feet and ch@@ anc@@ ellor Merkel the bl@@ os@@ som@@ ing of the Af@@ ak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have acceler@@ ated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with their sp@@ itz@@ enk@@ an@@ di@@ daten , the Minister of the Lorenz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you are at the right place at the right place .
she invited two ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel on major events ; Merkel Bundest@@ ag@@ sw@@ ahl@@ kreis lies in the Nor@@ theast .
but the target group does not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia , Berliner and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compl@@ ained Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the NDR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it has a shame not to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , even Angela Merkel .
otherwise the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U have largely disp@@ ens@@ ed to the usual elec@@ toral campa@@ ign@@ ing on market places and in front of shopping centers with umbre@@ llas and air ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what does &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kok@@ ert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minor role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the Union has marked that in the country the base is ar@@ dent , that it must be very strict , again a dra@@ fted to the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are going on like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the desert of the country hardly exists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is also self @-@ confident : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must go there , where people are w@@ aking , namely , where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ est , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because there is much at stake , Sell@@ ering its SPD now called for a particularly committed election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in surveys the Socialists and Democrats last seen with 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just in front of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in 2011 , the SPD was still clear with 35,@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Green , small @-@ party with seven percent in the surveys , should be allowed the leap into the country &apos;s day .
you make a modern virtu@@ e from the holidays need a modern virtu@@ e and put their choices of great @-@ bl@@ iss into the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is called the presi@@ dents Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green elec@@ toral campa@@ ign@@ ing on track @-@ search for native p@@ ac@@ companies among the tourists .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the sp@@ itz@@ enk@@ an@@ di@@ dat@@ in , cur@@ ated straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it still beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ San@@ itation : Gast@@ sta@@ etten suffer from blocking
at the speed , with which the B 27 is re@@ constructed , there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible for construction work , starting at 5.@@ 30 am and only after 20 o &apos;clock , there is com@@ er@@ ly praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have done everything rather c@@ ack@@ ly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tells El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet @-@ Tank@@ stelle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no move .
the construction site could be postpon@@ ed at the end of the end to the half @-@ time as planned , until the end of October everything should be ready .
money is also used for those responsible for the construction work , e.g. when it comes to setting up containers .
since the construction site on Monday to south is w@@ ander@@ ed and also the block of Asp@@ erg@@ straße was lifted in Of@@ ter@@ dingen and thus also the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has also recovered , the traffic situation within the place is relaxed .
the citizens can now travel from Of@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 again .
the extinction with the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was partly considerable complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Vice @-@ sponsored management of the rehabilitation of the Vice @-@ President Florian King . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inhabitants of Bach@@ stre@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ nerst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain were struggling with more traffic noise , because many sc@@ are sear@@ ched and more likely to trust their nav@@ y than the sign@@ age .
what resulted in some users in co@@ habit@@ ations in the areas of living areas .
as well as the speed b@@ umps were not observed , the church rein@@ forces the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was considerable cross@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who himself made himself a location on location . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there have been two to three per minute already .
the fastest has been on the pace with 77 @-@ kilometers in the tempo @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has moved , it was quiet .
for the busin@@ ess@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small comfort that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg , now the road is open again .
visitors don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but that the B 27 @-@ rehabilitation has led to their sales income , everyone we asked to look through . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so for other companies , for whom the refurb@@ ishment has hardly consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even at the Auto@@ haus Maier , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most light decline , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also a fact that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is missing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the strongest terms , the Local runs along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly the crown , takes clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him but all the pub drive it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard hit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was missing the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen , and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we have to be glad about each euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the turnover recorded on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far over 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road management took its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two years back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his employees have released them .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and the half were released , politics would have responded differently .
instead , ruling out Jörg Schmidt on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there would be a financial balance , the Gast@@ stätte benef@@ itted otherwise from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now , they also have the dis@@ advantages that surrender to the refurb@@ ishment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other coun@@ ties where something has been controlled .
in all charges , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his guest @-@ site will continue .
after all , the family run has been settled since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history .
that other stem are less common now because of the complicated traffic @-@ performance , it can be understood .
if you cannot go down , it is elsewhere beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that his stem attack after the ending of the refurb@@ ishment dates back again , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the crises using B@@ SE and bird gri@@ ps , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 construction works on his cli@@ ent@@ ele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its hospitality in their long @-@ standing history .
six months construction work , this has been brutal .
constantly being s@@ lic@@ ted in the name of the terror against laws .
after the recent attacks , Interior de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a tome about security package .
but what has a D@@ ul@@ ence status to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ al@@ location say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Vers@@ öh@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are politically reasonable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they over@@ demand no one .
others , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
involved I took part in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as an interior Minister , he was part of his results and can be achieved at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achieved consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère won a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach before it presented its conclusions for security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some have already known , announce , war@@ med , that a new security authorities should take care of the kn@@ ack encryp@@ ted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , not the fact that Germany must implement several EU guidelines to aircraft data and weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is just not surprising .
in part de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , a second stop for proposals which have not been able to do with the SPD so far : he wants to stand a sympath@@ etic for terrorist groups among punishment and ji@@ ha@@ dists with a double citi@@ zenship of the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the CD@@ U @-@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he still consider this to be reasonable and does not ask anything that in the co@@ ition@@ er might not have any chances here .
a few new ideas presented to Mai@@ zi@@ ère as well .
in part , they are in part in itself : he plans for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ention of people from deport@@ ation .
refugees who are targeted in the country should previously reveal their smartphones and disclose social media account to a security examination .
for distr@@ acted asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than so far - about such that commit crimes or their papers to conce@@ al their identity .
some of that is political and legally sensitive .
Man@@ ches also works un@@ du@@ ous and leaves questions open .
and with some points - for the un@@ equal treatment of thought , for example - is the question : what does this actually have to do with certainty and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects of refugees and terror .
but it is not possible to address that the Att@@ ent@@ ences of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg refugees were .
in addition , many people in view of the high refugee numbers are worried about safety .
and things that deeply dealt with people now let them do not cl@@ ing in election times .
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
first the stops in the neighbourhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attack in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the re@@ assurance is great .
and yes , there are elec@@ toral campaigns .
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly moving into position upon the issue of internal security .
in the last days there was high up between the two parties .
only a gar@@ ant dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then via a security @-@ policy @-@ policy of some Uni@@ ons @-@ conductor , in which the resent@@ ment also require a Bur@@ ka pro@@ hibition and a revers@@ al of the dual citi@@ zenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also here to be reconc@@ iled sounds .
from a turn of a double pass , he does not hold anything .
we have tried the discussion in Germany .
you are emerging , be not sensible .
and at a Bur@@ ka pro@@ hibition he have constitutional concerns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if its own package is un@@ constitutional to all corners and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to show itself only . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot of things that could take care of contro@@ vers@@ y .
however , the SPD is currently trying to pro@@ voke the issue of internal security .
Chief Editor Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ aled first to talk careful talk and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot;
even Volkswagen gli@@ ding comes through .
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als rise the pay@@ able world @-@ wide .
but not all the markets it runs .
in the recall , there is vort@@ ex about a term .
Volkswagen starts from the first half @-@ year deliveries to the second half of the year .
in the previous year , Europe &apos;s largest automobile manufacturers can continue to advance a plus in the previous year despite the diesel engine , thanks to its many brands and several well @-@ lasting markets .
however , in July the nuclear mar@@ ke VW filed above all in Western Europe and increases the total sale , as that included in the D@@ ax agent .
the brand is sold in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year of the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales volumes are 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s months .
in the home market Germany s@@ ack@@ ten the disp@@ at@@ ches around almost one he@@ aders .
re@@ bran@@ ded Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weak@@ est figures from July especially on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it has been given in some core markets by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing economic environment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um also reduced from the EU , explained a speech @-@ in .
in the U.S. , where the deport@@ ation first has been escal@@ ated , there is also further a minus to be@@ ech .
a great support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the most affected skin @-@ smar@@ ks of the Lower Saxony is already further by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months it is only a deli@@ ver@@ ine of 0.9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles at be@@ ech .
consolidated Fred Kap@@ pler was further posted sales from January to July .
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen in this period , 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software b@@ um@@ s .
alone in Germany , VW is calling for some 2.5 million cars for re @-@ equipment in the workshops .
in the course of the conversion , VW , VW , that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects .
after the conversion of vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the car manufacturers set up a &quot; Guarant@@ ee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but do not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as it was on Friday in business travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason are legal host@@ ility .
the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported the Volkswagen @-@ flow of its German customers now nevertheless a guarantee for um@@ ented diesel models .
this would have confirmed last Monday VW representatives in the Federal Minister of ministry .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was confirmed that this meeting was conven@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fulfilled the expenditure of my research Commission and the KBA &apos;s proposal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vari@@ ances of this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Transport Minister Alexander Dobr@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has taken the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance after conversion , no deteri@@ or@@ ations will take place and all the @-@ approved vehicle data remains unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen himself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it meant to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the wide term &quot; guarantee , &quot; Volkswagen has the possibility that customers come for example a half year after conversion to a workshop - and this can lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do .
even in client interest , it is important to avoid that it is with any other damage , which , in fact , nothing to do with the ab@@ yss &apos;s sc@@ andal , to prevent an un@@ locking with any possible warranty arrangements , as it was .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , VW uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich sa@@ vers - as a second Institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ban@@ chef Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers , who park 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bundes@@ verband Deutscher banks speaks of an individual case and doesn &apos;t see it as a signal : normal savings should not be afraid to pay for their thri@@ ving pris@@ ons . &quot;
bear@@ ings banks spend money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.@@ 4 percent criminal proceedings .
this charge demands the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund starting from September private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 Euro to gi@@ ro@@ - or day @-@ day accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 in future will cost 400 euro a year , &quot; said Paul .
he has had 40 million Euros per day , which could be taken from one day to the other , and which he could not toler@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are at the central bank account and 0,4 % costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lie down for each million 4000 Euros &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he now leaves the costs according to the aud@@ itor principle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cash simply can lie in the Tres@@ ors of the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced four hi@@ ps too , I don &apos;t have the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ban@@ ker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers would have an understanding and are rarely changing on other systems .
only a few emig@@ rated to other banks .
the co@@ oper@@ atives of Bavaria declared : &quot; the extreme @-@ political course of the ECB is causing significant costs at all banks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are alone to carry , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; company @-@ economically permanently not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks therefore have their fees for transaction , credit cards or wire transfers .
with prisoners for deposits of three million euros had made the Th@@ ur@@ in@@ gian folk - and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land with their sk@@ ate bank branches 2014 head@@ lines .
Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the banking association , said : &quot; we do not expect that private clients have to pay for deposits , this is the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks much too strong . &quot;
a ban@@ ker said , at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a Cli@@ ent@@ el , which is equipped from property a little abundant . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they get free money hat@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 1911 founded Gen@@ ossen@@ schaft bank G@@ mund has two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
in the region there are popular actors , athletes and entrepreneurs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the co @-@ oper@@ association of Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are currently no further banks known to calculate the deposits of deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the German federation of German banks and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had explained in late June : &quot; the thres@@ hold , to neg@@ atives towards the private customer , is very , very high . &quot;
the competition was tough , and it dro@@ ves the emig@@ ration of investors to the competition .
the customers in Germany will not be pleased in the width .

Stu@@ art from Glas@@ go@@ w , 55 , which I followed by S@@ ister Ray ( Data q@@ ty : two young women , three men middle age ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( eight men middle age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and passes through the shops to fill in the few hours .
is he a collector , ask me ?
&quot; I already appreciate , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets .
this trans@@ duc@@ er , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I &apos;m not followed home ) , dress the walls of his sitting room .
the reason why he has such considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records which he could not afford as they appeared and re @-@ buy items that he sold , when he was young and ple@@ ite .
&quot; many things I Buy , are out of the late six@@ ties , early 70@@ ans , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things where I probably was something too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
it is true that those who are buying plates , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend their own time , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much .
this is my lo@@ aster .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers that he meets to the You@@ Go@@ v &apos;s profile .
however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who have been affected by the Medi@@ a@@ pe , people who have heard about com@@ eback and promp@@ ted to buy their old plates again .
from the conversations that I have led , people usually reported as around 1998 or 1999 of their collection .
customers that once bought their records to buy CDs and now sell their CDs to buy their records . &quot; he says .
that would explain the boom of tags of a certain age .
but what about the alle@@ ged emotional meaning of plates ?
it only takes a few seconds in a shop such as Ph@@ onica to recognize that record stores a so@@ othing community of in@@ minded people .
according to the WE@@ Z , some of the older customers were incur@@ red by the out@@ less payment system .
some record @-@ fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of confidential sil@@ ver@@ ers , of objects , the bl@@ iss@@ ful youth @-@ minded gu@@ ilt .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or poss@@ essions of material poss@@ essions than a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation . &quot;
this is my collectors , so I think it is so many people so .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like her social worker ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fl@@ avor@@ ing an employee of a record stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people have bought a record , they have not yet listened .
the survey also found out that 41 % possess a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , no record player .
at this time of the message , I would probably look very concerned while I da@@ zz@@ led through a stack to Bossa Nova Komp@@ il@@ ations .
J@@ onny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( number of men : three men aged @-@ aged ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ vals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone came just recently here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead sound , so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a great percentage , but it is definitely going to happen .
more product @-@ duty , less musi@@ c@@ ig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older who come only slowly .
F@@ op@@ p , which has devoted to the sound Pl@@ ates nearly a whole floor , has a lively audience than I re@@ w .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and women middle aged men .
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops is - Wild Be@@ asts neu@@ ter synth@@ esi@@ red and sex@@ be@@ pack@@ aged pop instead of experimental , penet@@ rated from the speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks scar@@ let , but nag@@ ging psych@@ ic trau@@ mata are hard to define when you stand beside someone 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been around in business for a few minutes and looks at the variation for sale .
it makes more a display ort@@ ality than a large scale .
it does not deserve much , so the collecting of boards is not a real option , she says .
it costs much .
it &apos;s easy to hear music from a computer or another way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives with a li@@ ke@@ able epide@@ m@@ zer .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is really unique .
my last stop is a business , which is said that a new generation of record @-@ owners should have inspired : urban out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I &apos;m giving the sunshine , the je@@ ans @-@ hot@@ p@@ ants , I observe a group of young teen@@ ager , who had for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are wondering to buy a cros@@ ley turn@@ table .
on the left is a stair@@ well , a wall full of panels of Ad@@ ele , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , essential plates for an average collection .
nobody sees it itself - maybe because they are only purely or@@ nam@@ ental , some so far above that it &apos;s impossible to grasp them .
it is pure &quot; record . &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of so@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
even though my research inquiries made that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , let them at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the great number of female collectors and disco@@ s who exist in reality , disco@@ s and in On@@ line@@ lay@@ en .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning certainly not with the stroll through disco@@ s of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while watching the star@@ ring view of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year old mis@@ ator of which over the shoulders nothing else rag@@ ing middle aged men .

French Court re@@ jects offer on demol@@ ition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court has rejected a quot@@ ation of the authorities in Calais , do@@ zens of pro@@ visional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais , in the thousands of refugees live .
in a court proceedings this week argu@@ ed the authorities in Calais that the state should be@@ fu@@ elled , 72 pro@@ visional sales to sell in those individuals within the camp goods , from cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ soft , sell hair @-@ services or more simple meals for a few euros in pro@@ visional restaurants .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture is argu@@ ed that these places should be tor@@ n down , because they would represent a parallel economy not paid from which no taxes would be paid and those created a fire@@ side and san@@ itation .
humanitarian groups shared the court with that the shops and restaurants are important because the free meals which would be offered by state supported association and other groups , not enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also went out that the pro@@ visional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people who operate 72 pro@@ visional sales , but ad@@ mits that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Calais &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be absolutely understandable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François Mol@@ la said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just people to live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas of calm meeting between refugees and volunteers do not offer .
one of the places that was threatened by defe@@ ats , the young Book kids &apos; Café des Lag@@ ers was operated and 200 meals a day , English and French @-@ classes as well as advice on asylum seek@@ ers for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the pet@@ ition to maintain the kids &apos; café .
in a letter to the Guardian , it was that closure &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
the two aid agencies Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Auberge des Mig@@ rants appreciated on Friday that the number of people in the jungle have risen to more than 9,@@ 000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep rise of new@@ com@@ ers in the course of summer .

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
Germany Ras@@ mus must adapt to the next generation speeds : in different federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new light@@ ning devices will be tested , the tem@@ per is particularly effective .
the fut@@ urist@@ ic real En@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example on in@@ genu@@ ity , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example on highway network or to san@@ iti@@ ing bridges with temporary tem@@ p , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure the speed limit there with a stationary building .
a lasting mobile building can be too dangerous or consuming .
the En@@ forcement trailer is aut@@ ark : its cordless tools with un@@ interrupted exhibition operation five days , the case data is encryp@@ ted via a mo@@ dem .
laser measurement technology can also be captured over several tracks across several tracks .
variable speed b@@ umps as well as through@@ v@@ ings after time , lanes and vehicle Class can also be super@@ vised .
in the high @-@ run state you can move the p@@ endant according to manufacturer with each car with a trailer hook .
so that he is not simply lo@@ wer@@ ed , it is cut off in the measured operation , so the wheels in the ar@@ mo@@ red , and by the way also van@@ ish she@@ ar enh@@ ances disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the light@@ ning from Vand@@ alism .
since 2015 the trailer is tested according to data from Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now also used .
foreign officials also f@@ lashes with the new technique : recently , France has posted 100 pieces , following an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain cuts silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by , after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold takes charge
the impressive performance of Britain at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came to a ab@@ rupt halt during the last hur@@ dle in the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were struck with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ odoro stage here in Rio .
Fi@@ ji divided a master@@ class in handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , post @-@ race and ro@@ wer power to win Gold - her first Olympi@@ am@@ ed@@ aille of any color .
the defeat was failed because of the non @-@ poor performance of the silver med@@ al - the Great Britain on this day - and they could quite be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they proposed New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the distinct defeat of the B@@ oks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ finals on the same day could be returned to them in the final .
but independently of it fi@@ ji could have done a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in stock @-@ form .
it might be a Tro@@ st for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold med@@ al around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Editor Ben Ryan , the former Chief of the England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
he had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago they lost in Ryan of each game with Adel@@ aide Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this map will be w@@ ading , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began mar@@ vel@@ ous and made the attacks GB@@ s of fun dem@@ ons .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. in , when you &apos;re running in driving buses . the World Series winners were 5 @-@ 0 up@@ ward , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner r@@ rus@@ hed at the corner .
with just four minutes of game , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner which he conver@@ ts .
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely broke the ball .
a h@@ ep@@ rag@@ ing valley of Mitchell stops the mountain of man Leone Nak@@ ara@@ wa a third goal , but it has only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner a touch@@ down round and there stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ara@@ wa added a new beginning since the re @-@ finish and there was still over a minute of games ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ f@@ eit@@ ed by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB of teams and rus@@ hed up to line to make a gate .
the transformation brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while he was still un@@ covered .
this is how it is .
he introduced fundamental changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Jos@@ ua Tu@@ is@@ ova had gone after a brilliant stop@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan N@@ ort@@ on launched an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran for long in favour of the Süd@@ se@@ ein@@ sul@@ an , whose fans s@@ angen , flags and dances on the ble@@ ach@@ ers .
it was not hard to admire the play@@ ful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
M@@ ata V@@ ili@@ ame set the cake bas@@ ks with another attempt in the last seconds .
the wh@@ ist@@ le ch@@ ön@@ te , the fi@@ j@@ is um@@ hu@@ ts themselves and GB k@@ ick@@ ed crus@@ hing in the lawn .
formerly in the day Fi@@ ji Japan had conqu@@ ered in the semi @-@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and UK pushed South Africa in a tight semi @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Britain &apos;s conversion of difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the B@@ oks in the first half to the front , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on broke the line with an impressive foot@@ print and achieved a gate among the post in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling from Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ aside teams , securing the profit - and thus the silver med@@ al .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no p@@ aler@@ ting gold than in these games and that wants what is hot .
from the first stroke until the last , 220 hard tro@@ ieve , who enter into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional importance in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio since Lag@@ oa .
even if it were only the Bei@@ ge those who sat at the king , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams , was more present when they ru@@ sted the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in a row without tax lady , the first women in the history of the British Sports who laid out a standard .
your domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all you have more than more advanced use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant athletes , who through the surface planted with the elegance of spon@@ ges , which does not reflect the type of tri@@ umph@@ al point .
behind each gold in the ruin there is a batt@@ ali@@ on that contribute to the incre@@ mental progress to make the difference and it was nobody assistant than the coach who would not survive at all times when he was diagnosed this day when cancer was diagnosed .
as he said , he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , the oper@@ able and this did they did .
if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty sc@@ lim@@ ous situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he may start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , was able to start what the break up to a minimum in case that in such circumstances is the correct term .
I needed money , so I had to go back soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
this is how it starts .
the rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it another bigger .
in the in@@ medi@@ ability of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve wr@@ apped mor@@ nings that spent something more than usual and tried to process his own fears .
p@@ anning , which was considered captain in the Royal Ar@@ til@@ l@@ ery Reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . this is perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I mean how much I and Helen and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we would be no one , therefore a massive thank him . he is the best coach of the world .
I could not have a better person for coach or better trainers .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have no race lost over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents were not able to keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when teams from New Zealand and Denmark have started exp@@ ended , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very caught at the moment .
Helen called &quot; St@@ emp@@ t in the process , ab@@ ide in the process . &quot;
it is really important to let themselves not be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not going to make something Tol@@ les .
we didn &apos;t want to fire@@ work today , we simply wanted to achieve a good result , going out and win the race what we did .
the pair will take a time for one year before it will make decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve back@@ shall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I did not want that my last race was .
that would have much pressure .
in London it took about six months to conc@@ eive that I am an Olympi@@ ad .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
31 years of exempl@@ ary exempl@@ ary for clear@@ ance
the CEO of the Water@@ purpose @-@ ands &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ gruppe &quot; , R@@ up@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , continues to retirement .
the association is regarded as the &quot; bay@@ ern@@ most exempl@@ ary . &quot;
a small Frank@@ ish drinking water association as a model for the great water manufacturers .
it meant that some time ago in the origin@@ ality was made in a contribution from the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
a little later the water@@ forum gave the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken the kenn@@ amen .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ au@@ ch &quot; bay@@ ern@@ widely used as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
behind all this stands Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , who was 31 years in the Pur@@ chase Staff , was 28 years old as managing director .
now he was re@@ tired at the age of 65 in retirement .
the ti@@ pping @-@ purpose association of the V@@ eit@@ sch group , based in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , promotes an annual amount of about 15@@ 0000 cu@@ bic meters of water and supplies 32 places and hamlet with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member communities are the communities of Kirch@@ lau@@ ter , Breit@@ brunn , lou@@ der , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
for more towns and villages , there are water supply agreements .
the current president , Breit@@ brun@@ ner mayor , Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler 1985 was set as water@@ re@@ aker and was already appointed to the managing director of the Twin @-@ association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very varied and they range from water management and maintenance activities , budget@@ ary creation , calculation of fees and contributions to post@@ ings at weekends &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as outstanding events , she called the start @-@ up and inaugur@@ ation of the new well ( 1994 ) , land@@ filling in the field of new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the refurb@@ ishment of the stron@@ gh@@ old ( 1999 ) , the creation of a central computer controlling ( 2004 ) and the contra@@ indications of water cables .
there was no stal@@ em@@ ate and you have always recorded innovations because water is de@@ pressing and drinking water the most important food .
in its lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o , she praised G@@ öl@@ ler &apos;s faithful , reliable and accurate service over 31 years .
he has been employed with much passion for his water @-@ purpose association and he has also used the water@@ purpose association , as if it were its own business .
a few weeks ago , he considered a true practition@@ er to present the success @-@ concept of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ gruppe in front of the water forum of the district of Unter@@ fran@@ ken .
he has received a great deal of praise and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler himself engaged from the Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who have worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water@@ bed and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlights from his point of view he recorded the fountain and the restructuring of the Twin @-@ association .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the pi@@ pel@@ in at Kirch@@ lau@@ ter on 3rd January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night long , so that the villages were supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn at once can only be maintained because one filled the container from P@@ ett@@ stadt by strap .
the management of drinking water @-@ made association was handed over to Daniel storms of lau@@ er who advoc@@ ates the follow @-@ up of Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we were able to finally reach this tough negotiation after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission initially planned to ask the steel manufacturer , the gases from the ho@@ cho@@ w to generate electricity generation for their own consumption , to the chest .
the steel industry dro@@ pping out additional costs of 120 to 240 million Euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , it now give up a certificate with the EU Commission following talks with competition Comm@@ iss@@ arin Mar@@ gre@@ the Vest@@ ager .
only if the generators are replaced in the steel mills , an E@@ EG lev@@ y of 20 percent .
but even these will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission to self @-@ power generation .
this means that the status quo of the past regulation will be largely fixed .
particular importance was the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further you need to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even on the reform of the ETS are climate and employment targets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained IG Metall @-@ leader Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity since the financial crisis in 2008 and considerable price pressure .
in the past year , the situation intensified further than the world &apos;s largest producers in China given rise to the weak@@ est domestic demand on the world market .
European manufacturers raise Chinese steel @-@ resistant price d@@ ull .
in the course of this spring , the situation has a little relaxed .
on the one hand , ver@@ fu@@ hr@@ z@@ öl@@ le on imported effect , on the other hand the economic views in China have stopped .
un@@ clear how lasting the price reco@@ vering .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp remained cau@@ ti@@ ous on Thursday .
last , the prices would have been rather stag@@ nat@@ ing .
the industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp even wanted to not ex@@ clude any dis@@ rup@@ tions of certain works .
in the German steel industry , at the end of 2015 there were approximately 86@@ 000 people .
in July the German steel manufacturer remain careful despite rising prices and increasing orders .
they produced with 3.4 million tons to six percent less cru@@ st@@ ole than in the previous year &apos;s year , such as the Economic Co @-@ Association voted on Friday .
after a brief increase in May , the number of things went back in the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production is worth two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months the association expects an improved order situation with a rising output level .
community , Spirit , Health : sing sen@@ iors well
the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in teacher @-@ study she recorded the barrel music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old he s@@ ings in a senior choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singing moves me - emotional and physically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; describes it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a sample she feels balanced , cheerful and overall survival , she says .
at the same time , she does something good in doing so with her health and mind .
for singing is equal from several perspectives a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler of the German sen@@ iors .
most sen@@ iors singers in chor@@ us and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular connections , sen@@ iors can make social contacts and cultiv@@ ate .
because frequently , social and family structures emerge at the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speak and organize themselves to be able to rely on the others - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be ti@@ ring in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for in doing sen@@ iors a deep and controlled breathing .
who@@ ever calls his lungs regularly , even in everyday life not so quickly from the pu@@ ste .
even if it &apos;s about obtaining the sound of the voice in the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby .
on Elderly , singing often has a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz says from the federal work community of the senior organizations .
in the older generations , the common chair had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure , explains them .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or hearing of songs in elderly people awak@@ ens many memories , often linked to positive emotions of their youth .
by lyrics and especially mel@@ o@@ dies war@@ es themselves den@@ ote people in long @-@ lying events .
when singing , the head does not require special performance , explains L@@ enz .
at the same time concentrate on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cogn@@ itive challenge .
just older people who live alone , practice not only on themselves .
another positive aspect is the acknowled@@ gment that one drives through the singing in the choir , thinks H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem grows by the singing in the choir .
to show yourself : if I am long for something , I will get better and vig@@ orous about me - this experience strength@@ ens .
good reasons to start with the singing , so there is enough .
those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks of having little talent , betra@@ ying L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t s@@ ings alone - with 50 singing people who listen to it , when a sound goes on it ?
looking for the right offer , sen@@ iors various ways , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
s@@ ings someone from the familiar circle in a senior choir , you can just connect .
many towns also offer views over the cho@@ irs in the area .
those who want to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ ast@@ ing choir can turn directly to the church or the F@@ athers .
many sen@@ ti@@ ch@@ ors can also be found via the Internet .
those who do not have access to the internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors to help with the Internet .
who desire has to sing , should necessarily join a choir , betra@@ ying H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing the soul is good and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to every age .
cats react sensitive to w@@ ater to scre@@ ams of the young
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , which effect the pen@@ alties of Katzen@@ bab@@ ys on adult animals has .
to their surprise the male also allowed the males do not cold - however they thought of the females always the same .
female cats can identify the income of cats at the r@@ ust of the little ones .
they respond to ten percent faster to the foli@@ age of kittens that are found in great need , such as scientists from the veter@@ inary school and the Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
K@@ ater also react to the babies of kittens - but always the same .
&quot; evi@@ d@@ ently , the acoustic differences between the di@@ gest of less and strongly inher@@ ited juven@@ ate for the males either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the Biolog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding von der MH@@ H .
it is the first @-@ author of the study that was published on this Friday at the magazine &quot; BMC evolution@@ u@@ tionary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
in a previous investigation the research team had already found out that the duration and height of the kittens with the ur@@ gency of their assistance is distinguished .
in a total of nine adult boys and eight females , were observed out of the animal @-@ position of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a ru@@ p of babies which were taken for three minutes from the Wur@@ f@@ box and separated by mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand they were confronted with scre@@ am of stronger reg@@ ained kittens who were additionally up@@ lifted .
the researchers consider their results despite the low test sample for sag@@ ging .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who had not yet had its own offspring , re@@ acted differenti@@ ated on the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned out faster to Spe@@ aker when this ru@@ fe played a very active kit@@ ties .
this ability may be inn@@ um@@ ors or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have responded to all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Biolog@@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists have previously studied the reactions of women and men in the past several times in the past .
also , some studies showed that women are more sensitive to inf@@ ants , whether they were mothers or not , reported the Biolog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .
Pod@@ olski starts with &quot; g@@ ala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r is a football coach in Turkey .
in Turkey against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r had been received an ar@@ rest warran@@ t .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , in Turkey there is an important football match .
in front of the Du@@ ell of the Arch@@ bishop Istanbul and Luke Pod@@ ol@@ sky Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line clear : &quot; business as &quot; is said .
already in the exp@@ ir@@ ation of the exp@@ ung@@ ence after the crash trial in July , the government , the everyday life of normal brus@@ hes should not be affected .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt .
even before the football is not done .
against the former Star@@ k@@ ick@@ er Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r provided the prosec@@ ution for a warran@@ t .
therefore , in America the sweet@@ ener will be accused of being member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ ch@@ r should be p@@ endant of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who will be held responsible by the President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an for the coup attempt .
indeed , it is true for 90 days of sel@@ ective period until October , in fact , this is the life of most Tur@@ ks , but as good as no re@@ perc@@ ussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the nä@@ sham@@ eful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared Erd@@ og@@ an on Wednesday for finished . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split in trailer and enemies .
especially fans of the working class clubs are traditionally not among the friends of the President .
but what the resent@@ ment of the Tur@@ ks in view of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
and even the fans agree - no matter whether their heart is be@@ aming for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Co@@ kt@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; g@@ ala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be especially arriving on Luke Pod@@ olski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his sporting value introduced the Cologne &apos;s season in the expired season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old came out his first time as a pot of his association .
in the end@@ game against Fen@@ er@@ bah@@ s , he recorded 1 : 0 @-@ winner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FAN@@ AT@@ IK &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he completed the season in an excellent way and secured the award .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; the dis@@ appointing season for the record master was an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able conclusion .
after the Vor@@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lion &quot; also distinguished in the Europe League early .
in the sweet@@ per Li@@ g it &apos;s just to rank six .
the season was not good .
the Pok@@ al was the only way to gain something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is done and that is the most important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pod@@ olski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Wal@@ kt@@ as , the game was better .
especially thanks to Mario G@@ ome@@ z , who with 26 sauna @-@ figures as a Sü@@ via @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ sch@@ ütz@@ heads laid the basis for the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year @-@ old .
in this case , at the AC Florence involved in the contract and in the event he was only bor@@ row@@ ed in bor@@ row@@ ed G@@ ome@@ z , following the coup attempt to return on account of the political situation in the country after its EM holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario still wants to come to us it must only say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kick@@ er &quot; Club@@ winner F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to do this , the falls must be ready to re@@ lin@@ qu@@ ish on about a third of his to 7.5 million Euros and asked , Or@@ man said : &quot; be his sal@@ ary in Florence we cannot pay . &quot;
despite d@@ oping : these athletes still have medals chances for Olympics in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Just@@ in Gat@@ lin was closed twice because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - V@@ hist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wer@@ in Julia step@@ an@@ owa must not start in Rio .
others over@@ led athletes le@@ tics can only lau@@ gh - they are fighting in Rio around medals .
the theme d@@ oping determines how before the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
the Russian swi@@ m@@ in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who had caught up after a d@@ oping @-@ lock her start right shortly before playing , was caught off at its start ( 100 meters chest ) gr@@ ass@@ ed ti@@ p@@ ated and booked .
it seemed to be a sk@@ elet@@ on scenario : with a set @-@ up smile she was still decorated in Halle and had pro@@ voke their appearance with her appearance .
to be fir@@ st@@ ened that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a jas@@ per .
but there are numerous additional sport@@ s@@ men who walk at the Rio Olympics in Rio in spite of D@@ oping past .
here an overview :
Just@@ in Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was locked two times because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since his spell the Olympi@@ asi@@ eger from 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion is even faster than before , he is number one in the world over 100 m and is regarded as the greatest des@@ crip@@ tive of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ ress and si@@ eben@@ ish World Championship in 2010 had to sit in 2010 a hex@@ sm@@ on@@ ati@@ gue lock , after having been shown the intake of pain using O@@ xy@@ co@@ don .
after a surgery you have had a severe pain , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended themselves .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 was tested the Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ ress of 2012 , World Championships from 2013 and Europ@@ am@@ eister@@ schaft from 2010 to 2016 positive on the ban stim@@ ul@@ ant @-@ means meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin .
Per@@ kovic be@@ g the wis@@ ely in@@ gest@@ ion and was locked in six months .
the four wid@@ est thro@@ ws this year go to the account of the big gold f@@ avo@@ red .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ry ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the Beijing @-@ Olympi@@ asi@@ eger and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was tested positive and 21 months was suspended .
a means of penis enlargement was responsible , beg@@ ining Mer@@ ry .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is about 200 and 400 m the fastest man in the world .
I@@ wan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : probably barely any ath@@ l@@ ete were subsequently recognized as many medals .
so , T@@ ich@@ on his World Cup tracks out of 2005 nine years later , after having observed testosterone d@@ oping .
the meantime 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave Olympia @-@ silver 2004 for ster@@ oid dy@@ op@@ ings and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
the Bronze med@@ al of the Olympic Games in 2008 he received due to a judgment of the International Sport@@ swe@@ dish CAS .
with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is on the rank two of the world @-@ tran@@ si@@ list .
Li@@ u Hong Kong ( 20 km Walk , China ) : the Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord@@ ress and Gold@@ f@@ avo@@ in was first tested in May , but must still start in Rio .
at the 29 years old world cup , hints have been found at taking a ver@@ bot@@ her@@ ed supplement reg@@ imen , the sper@@ re of the world anti @-@ D@@ oping agency W@@ ada fell mild and ran already on July 13 .
Bom@@ ben@@ ign in Thailand - Austri@@ ans wo@@ unded - Mehr@@ ere T@@ ote
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is standing in contact with the woman , said the speaker of the State Department , Thomas Schn@@ öl@@ l , Fri@@ day@@ early .
they had s@@ lei@@ gh@@ olds and had been treated in the hospital , but have already left this time .
she had planned your visit@@ or@@ trip to the beginning of September .
whether from further explo@@ sions on the Holidays island Ph@@ uk@@ et , as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ p@@ Ar@@ c too , Austrian citizens are also un@@ clear .
the State Department also stands in contact with the local authorities , so Schn@@ öl@@ l .
around 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok downtown Hu@@ a H@@ in were first explo@@ des in a quarter of two bom@@ bs on Thursday nights .
according to the police , a Tha@@ il@@ änder@@ in was killed and around 20 people were wo@@ unded , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch , and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning again , two explo@@ sions went high , and the authorities were killed another man according to the authorities .
also from Ph@@ uk@@ et was reported in the morning a bom@@ bs .
in the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular Ba@@ dest@@ ran@@ ds Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver has been viol@@ ated by police information .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the southeast coast of the country then another bom@@ b which k@@ ites a municipal ban .
the jumping mat was passed according to the authorities in a cau@@ li@@ et before the re@@ four of the coastal pol@@ arity into the air .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations called in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast , as well as in Ch@@ ad@@ on at the southeast coast several inju@@ red .
one go from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bom@@ ben@@ sh@@ ates carry the same hand@@ writing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said army @-@ eral Dan@@ ai Krit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Fri@@ es@@ ome before journalist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that this is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated approach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to speak to possible mot@@ if@@ s - probably it is a matter of the deeds of Muslim rebels .
the Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks , which is typical for the bom@@ bing , Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police declared , however , did not argue in connection with the Islam@@ ist rebel@@ lion or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local Sab@@ ot@@ age , which limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead , one affir@@ med that the bom@@ bs of opponents of the ruling military j@@ unta were laid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities had kept secret references to upcoming events in the south of the country - but they have not been informed about the exact time and the places . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet it is un@@ clear what group behind the attacks st@@ alls .
the police took their officials in the whole country to enhance security around important government buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ements .
in Thailand there are always smaller bom@@ b attacks , but they usually do not judge them against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ an is located a palace that was used over the years of Tha@@ il@@ ands king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to the amend@@ ment bom@@ b , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at his home page , to provide the instructions of the Thai safety authorities .
high safety risk ( security level 3 ) praised for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ a@@ ear and surroundings .
after conflicts between security guards and Muslim people , not necessary travel to these provinces are de@@ duc@@ ted .
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) money for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday very few days after a controversial referendum on one of the military j@@ unta worked out .
this de@@ fer@@ ment of the military has enormous influence in the years to come .
Jun@@ ta leader and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said the bom@@ bs were an attempt to don@@ ate chaos , while the country move towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military j@@ unta , which took power after a phase of bloody accidents , considers himself to be good , the kingdom has led back to stability and order .
however , the military has not succeeded in getting a grip on the control over the coming south of the country in the far south of the country .
more than 6,@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
a year ago many people were killed in Bangkok in a popular Hind@@ u archipelago of 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody bom@@ b of the younger history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is at the spot@@ light of the federal state for constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several branches , the Constitu@@ tional Commission also held the Group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference points for aspirations against the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democratic democratic principles &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Constitu@@ tion@@ Office Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , the emig@@ rants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are considered in a extrem@@ ly way .
therefore , we are monitoring the movement now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turns against &quot; multic@@ ul@@ tural W@@ ahn , &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration , &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s identity by alien@@ ation . &quot;
Constitu@@ tional Pap@@ ers in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , Saxony , Lower Saxony , Saxony , and Th@@ ur@@ in@@ gia - observe the &quot; identity . &quot;
Ma@@ ate said , his authority was closely coordinated with the offices in the decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &apos; ident@@ it@@ arian movement &apos; try to pick up their target audience , where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the constitutional chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extrem@@ ists are trying to speak with you@@ thful language often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the daily Islam@@ ists as well as right wing @-@ wing extrem@@ ists .
this is not bet@@ ul@@ ful advertisement for the one &apos;s own thing .
propaganda should address people emoti@@ onally .
young people are sus@@ cep@@ tible in a special way .
this is dangerous .
finally , from several federal states , there have been reports of contacts from the &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; of Af@@ ak politicians .
Ma@@ ate said , so he did not have any knowledge .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind will be relevant only from a certain point .
it depends if the particular party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain persons , which are extrem@@ ist , its determination is changing and so extrem@@ ist .
so , whether such people have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not visible .
with a view of the marked increase of legal criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and Refu@@ ge@@ es , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we have established in recent years that it can be illegal structures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it gave the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it can be quite sure that further legal group@@ ings or small groups make up the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against Refu@@ ling@@ sh@@ ei@@ me or attack from other right @-@ sex@@ ist mot@@ if@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Germany @-@ wide or pan @-@ European control of sp@@ aci@@ ousness is not recogni@@ z@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the past groups have emerged on the regional level or in social networks .
they are worried about the fact that many over@@ gri@@ ps went to the account of people who were not in appearance before in the right scene .
this is the wor@@ rying .
many of the Tat@@ ev@@ is@@ ers at the attack on asylum seek@@ ers were not previously known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated , or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed criminal off@@ ences , which had previously been politically in@@ different , or elected politically in@@ different , or for example CD@@ U , SPD or left , who then have radic@@ ally radic@@ alised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is becoming the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympi@@ oni@@ ken or world @-@ records of the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ ageous appearance of RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer in Rio de Janeiro .
in the aqu@@ atics center fluctu@@ ating the slightly overweight swi@@ mm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the detail was selected .
in social networks it was then turned into vir@@ al inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact the 24 @-@ year @-@ old with a return of 48 seconds lead his outlet and recorded the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not a sport@@ y figure that attracted the attention of international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still participate in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian was awarded a special start@@ up from the international Flo@@ wers .
this is distributed to make swimming in underground countries well known .
because in ether the most ath@@ l@@ ete run , just wanted to do something else .
preparation is all : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first pointed names made the lap .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media used him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RO@@ BEL &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well @-@ well &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English Bou@@ lev@@ ards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about him funny . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he suggested only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of air style , there played no role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i for medi@@ al attention .

at an accident of a travel agency with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers travelling , eight people were wo@@ unded on Thursday in Kr@@ umm@@ hör@@ n ( County Au@@ rich ) .
two of the in@@ mates were severe injuries , divided the police with him .
the 66 year old travel of the bus from Eisen@@ ach had to counter@@ lift their details , according to a counter@@ f@@ aster , which was partly driving on the counter@@ r@@ ink .
the bus came to the right of the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch as a spokes@@ woman named Au@@ rich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus the people could not leave the bus no self @-@ confident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire@@ brig@@ ade liber@@ ates the in@@ mates .
six rescue cars and an emergency hospital came to Un@@ cas@@ ort on the provincial road 2 .

the fees per Ku@@ bik@@ meter Ab@@ wasser will amount from 1 October 2016 for the area of the se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ berg 3,@@ 44 Euro previously ; for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( so far Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( so far , 6 euros ) .
during the residence in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wage fee will only then increase if appropriate improvements are necessary .
after a relevant calculation , the Ab@@ wasser@@ preis in Az@@ endorf is then located at 4,@@ 37 euros per Ku@@ bik@@ meter .
as Mayor of Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported on the approval of the budget by the District Court Kul@@ mb@@ ach , established that for these waste @-@ heating plants .
the Kas@@ endorf market is committed to the right basis of operating systems .
as of 1 October 2016 , citizens as well as commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg must take deeper into the w@@ allet .
the tou@@ ching between 48 and 67 percent .
like the administration of Herbert Schmidt the body was dra@@ fted , a ren@@ kal@@ ine of charges for the waste of the market is necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 there are over@@ - or sub @-@ covers from the prec@@ eding calendar period .
the engra@@ ving tou@@ ching sl@@ ats introduced Schmidt so that it is with all three f@@ ages around relatively small facilities with a very small waste water , which lie between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year .
in this way , due to the low distribution situation , for example , the expenditure for the necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would have a considerable impact .
moreover , the wast@@ ew@@ ays in all three systems is easily declined .
in addition , the subsequent to @-@ sec@@ ular calendar period for all three installations last not least due to its age , and repair @-@ ups in a considerable extent .
the facility in Az@@ endorf was nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years .
Schmidt dist@@ ressing that in the az@@ im@@ plant Az@@ endorf , the mechanical Bel@@ ü@@ ft@@ ment system had to be exchanged due to damage .
in the P@@ ump@@ werk world money , which had to be over@@ hau@@ led nearly 20 years old F@@ ÖR@@ DER@@ AN@@ LA@@ G@@ EN for nearly 20 years of operation of the first Kl@@ är@@ tei@@ ch to be installed after nearly 20 years of operation of the first Kl@@ är@@ tei@@ ch to be installed and an additional ventilation system , in order to be able to comply with the water @-@ legal requirements in future .
Schmidt : &quot; for these extraordinary expenses came the long @-@ written supervis@@ or and maintenance costs involved in the new cal@@ am@@ ation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which at the previous post@@ ulation in the years 2011 / 2012 will still be clearly below the current level .
stone houses clear that in the small waste case in the three facilities the expenses for the operation and maintenance are fully en@@ forced . &quot;
in the same way , Schmidt , the market share of large entertainment costs in the se@@ wage costs have been spar@@ ed over the past 20 years .
the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to be pre@@ ached in the duration of Stein@@ häuser in the duration , especially since you can not extend the supply @-@ area of the se@@ wage association Fri@@ esen@@ b@@ acht@@ al for these installations , because it is a matter of defic@@ it .
Bulgaria caught up for the first time in 8 months of inflation
domestic statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July 1 % was on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , as a positive 0.2 % .
the annual average exchange of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , that is , the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was compared to December 2015 compared to July 2015 was compared to July 2015 -@@ 0.2 % .

Snap@@ chat &quot; An@@ ime &quot; -@@ effect as asi@@ atic car@@ ic@@ ature
Snap@@ chat says that this filter An@@ ime is inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is uns@@ ur@@ ensi@@ bly towards breeds .
with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat allows around 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with ident@@ ities in such a way that is already visible as absur@@ de .
you can transform itself into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that might be from a matter of Roy Lich@@ tenstein .
the filters are un@@ bl@@ aded , stand@@ ar@@ ating tools that produce more than 30 million enhanced mer@@ ry per day .
all the ab@@ re@@ ments come to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have drawn cr@@ itic in the past , in which they were accused of using the app &apos;s Black@@ face or would pro@@ pag@@ ate white skin as beauty ideal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when there were some users a filter to some users who gave them dirty , false teeth and bot@@ her@@ ed che@@ eks , some critics were a rac@@ ist cartoon by Asi@@ ans - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gel@@ b@@ ang &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they asked whether this repet@@ ition is referred to on a larger problem that the company has with diversity .
the news and the rebel@@ lion were spread far on Wednesday with reports from The Ver@@ ge and motherboard , a day after Snap@@ chat , that it would have been disabled .
the company provided an exc@@ use : the filter was intended as a hom@@ age to An@@ ime @-@ characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders , the r@@ attle @-@ sm@@ us experiences , reminded of the filter of viol@@ ating c@@ lich@@ és .
other ro@@ bor@@ ns the An@@ ime @-@ comparison decided .
in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ et has been widely used across the photos that the filter &quot; hur@@ ting and was said uncomfortable . &quot;
it added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the counter @-@ position of a very contradic@@ tory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the fil@@ tering effects .
it shows that the filter is not spot@@ ted , but that the Gel@@ b@@ head was drawn into the worth@@ less extreme .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural cle@@ ment wi@@ red .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless trails and integration of integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are more di@@ vers@@ ed in the race than their older counter@@ players - could rather assume that sensitivity can be expected .
if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats fil@@ tering a picture creates that for one user is insul@@ ting , &quot; So it &apos;s much more difficult that such things were un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Z@@ hu , in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who worked as Produ@@ ct@@ manager and engineers , working for medium to clear their Snap@@ chat account , asking others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that they &apos;re thinking that ra@@ acci@@ d cont@@ ro@@ ses have a lack of diversity among the in@@ stell@@ ations in Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ized the large part white , only male leaders and ended their attachment with an has@@ ht@@ ag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either they do not have any representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions which they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat has mostly left un@@ answered .
the company has not published any figures for the diversity of its employees and points out to its status as a private company .
on Thursday there were Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees , but according to a spokes@@ person , the company recently focused on a personnel responsible , focused on sub@@ mits population groups and concentr@@ ating on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu said , in turn , that she will be closed their Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more user like us to say that this is not o.@@ k@@ . is . &quot;
military management of the ISIS &apos; intelligence &apos; information , presents the Committee of Congress
military relatives of the United States Central Command have changed information in order to record an optim@@ istic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when it allowed the actual states of Congress in a report on Thursday .
the Pre@@ liminary Report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can Committee , Secret Services Committee and the German cons@@ ular komm@@ ites , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction under Central Command secret services , which reported how prec@@ eding its ass@@ essm@@ ents changed to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligence service requested , written by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com , recorded a more positive image of American efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed the actual states on the spot , and were significantly more positive than analyses of other news services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited a newspaper article &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what has happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers have to be presented if bad analyses of our political leaders will be presented , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can Member of the House of Represent@@ atives , firm .
the leadership in the Cent@@ Com reach up to the top leader in the organisation .
the ten @-@ round report presents detailed meetings in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the education of the Iraqi Ar@@ med Forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government tips given under Obama statements , shows how anal@@ ysts saw the pressure from their suburbs , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; during the first semi @-@ year 2015 , many Central Command press releases , comments and statements in the Congress were significantly more positive than it matches the facts . &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com has publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ elle could already start in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ sul , the second @-@ largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , is so clear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pei , republi@@ can Congress of K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of Central Command have changed the following reports to play the danger of ISIS in Iraq .
the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force to Life , after it was agreed that anal@@ ysts got worried about the Mani@@ pulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday is further completed by more detailed findings throughout the investigation .
additional investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are ongoing through the United Nations Secretary of Defense .
democratic members of the news account published on Thursday published their own findings , which matches some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com generated a un@@ restricted process for the creation of news channels to IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , gave the highest standards in the Komm@@ itt@@ ee , Member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Shi@@ p , in an opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , so Mr. Shi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bog@@ ged the publication of retro@@ active reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ash@@ amed the mor@@ ality among anal@@ ysts , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave over little space for differ@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and Democrats voic@@ ed no evidence to have found evidence of the w@@ allet of the White House at the Cent@@ Com analy@@ st in regard to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations of Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Beast . &quot;
last August the New York Times reported by investig@@ ators on the Pent@@ agon , which were recorded by Cent@@ Com analy@@ st .
l . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press spokes@@ man of the Pent@@ agon , gave in an opinion that the Secretary of Defence would have no reports of Congress , while the investigation of the general spec@@ tor was still going on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also assumed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have no diver@@ ging opinions about the interpretation of complex data and that the intelligence services and Defence ministers welcomed a contro@@ vers@@ y discussion on these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have acted beyond the question of a successful a@@ erial campaign on American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion which is now done by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question that President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest ass@@ essm@@ ents of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State remind il@@ ities of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , looking forward to the recommendations of many analy@@ st only a small cre@@ dence of Iraq in Iraq and had little time on it to make thinking about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the revol@@ t against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker , according to government officials , that contrary to the statements of the Government strikes , no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as this pro@@ visional refin@@ ing would have been put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al instruction , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ized by members of the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure due to its over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin went into the retirement in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US winning players in the field @-@ ho@@ ckey der Frauen , a show@@ down with Great Britain
one day after they shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American Feld@@ ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday to India , that the Americans se@@ ers with 3 @-@ 0 acu@@ ity .
five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said , she could not remember the ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I am not belonging to people who keep their goals in memory .
however , they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are still in their group with the Britain on the first place , which remain un@@ be@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will succ@@ um@@ b their first round on Saturday in the last game .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which of both within their group from six teams will win the first and second place .
the first @-@ place will last the strong Dut@@ ch@@ ine somewhat longer out of the way that will lead the other group .
as always the game may go on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vort@@ ex by their success story , four years after they landed in the last London games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey bat in hands ( her two older sisters gave the Sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became a national game of the USA , the most recent one in the history of the team .
it missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 because it was not able to qualify for the cad@@ ade .
then the year 2012 , in which for her and her team everything went off .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the national team and hence the things began to get better .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the working trip to London , which we now have .
we will be able to pl@@ uck the ruin completely .
on Thursday nights B@@ am opened the tor@@ ches in the first half of the game with a back@@ hand out of the clos@@ et .
India was gone without victory in the tournament , but the team showed himself surprisingly strong and held the player from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
they took a Sprint with the flat ball through the left side flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and invited the ball into the gate for the Americans to get a 2 @-@ 0 guide .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last four district .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the ke@@ e@@ pers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs which until now had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ oline
wherever you are , as late it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel in@@ consistent and in@@ war@@ dly , a light@@ ning season between competition and stri@@ ving .
it is as if the olymp@@ ic f@@ ack@@ el itself would be a com@@ bu@@ sti@@ ble st@@ ab , which is protected from the w@@ rist@@ band to the swimming pool to the Tri@@ ath@@ l@@ ete .
you can not turn the television , read a newspaper or listen when talking to your neighbours in queue in the coffee shop without about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman black with barbecue , could indeed have been sent among these well @-@ known names which would be sent to Prime Time designed by sponsors and well @-@ being TV commerci@@ als if he would be a swi@@ mm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts , or even real estate .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting in the Olympic Tramp@@ oline for gold .
the olymp@@ ic flame does not illumin@@ ates every event alike .
further from the center , partly in the shade , are the sports that are not generally recognized : air pist@@ ol shoot , arch@@ ery , Bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the chest swimming and may it last for a long time .
but if I might think hum@@ ble arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the tramp@@ oline .
although the tramp@@ oline has already been a Olympic event since 2000 , when it had been in Sydney there was the last 16 years so spar@@ sely noticed that many things , I had asked , did not know that it is an Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art .
this could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
although the US sent Ath@@ l@@ eten for competition , it has never won a med@@ al in the tramp@@ oline and had a ath@@ l@@ ete to the end of 2012 .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to feed the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadi@@ ans for the women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold med@@ al from London this year .
the tramp@@ oline resi@@ ght a certain out@@ sider , partly because it sounds for the un@@ resolved ear @-@ fit for a cl@@ owns pre@@ school than that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an un@@ pack@@ aged enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ orous tre@@ mb@@ ling - the kar@@ to@@ on@@ ous tre@@ mb@@ ling of his never ending qu@@ itting - but also the Grazie of the gy@@ ms and pi@@ geon , the two sports that combines it essentially .
the word &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as the spr@@ ing@@ board .
rising winner jumping on a gigantic tramp@@ oline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( rotating , genuine and sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet .
they are assessed according to official Olympic @-@ m according to the execution , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women to compete against each other in Rio .
the common Olympic V@@ ektor is straight .
med@@ alli@@ ed hop@@ ed must continue in their quest for gold , faster , up@@ wards and over , sometimes till the goal , sometimes back and back , up@@ wards and down on the playground .
they are not only the Zi@@ ell@@ in@@ ie or the cur@@ wall , but in the television recording also another cave objective : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ords .
the purpos@@ eful pursuit is no@@ bles , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atical - and it is enough to even st@@ ir a audience to tears .
but it is also what I find even while watching this games as a bit ti@@ ring .
of which the tramp@@ oline offers a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the vector of the tr@@ amp @-@ jum@@ per is above .
a forward @-@ moving movement is not the goal .
he or she pr@@ all@@ ude from , seem@@ ingly he@@ avier than an ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then after below , then ef@@ fort@@ lessly back up .
there is also a competition , of course , not without difficulty but during exercise there is no h@@ ect@@ onic attack on the goal , no w@@ aking in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant abolition of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can only be .
the qualification and end@@ ings of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; those of the men on Saturday , also about 13@@ .00 .
N@@ BC will shine the ends as part of a afternoon @-@ blocks on both days from 14@@ .00 .
in the midst of the Olympia Man@@ ie , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be over@@ looked at the general tum@@ ult .
if the consciousness levels can only be achieved through the anxiety and the lens of mascul@@ ine athletes - as there is the male U.S. tur@@ ner according to The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits its after air rin@@ ks , new fan@@ es .
&quot; a generation protest@@ ed &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a allies of the USA
violent protest in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators , the political changes in Ethiopia are calling for violent resistance from the government .
witnesses say that zig demonstr@@ ators were killed during the cl@@ ashes with the police on Sch@@ or@@ ussia .
is Ethiopia just to come together ?
over the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid compos@@ ing of the West with a fast growing economy .
but in recent months , protests against the government sh@@ aken the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week turbul@@ ent thousands of people on the streets and slow@@ ed fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the response of the government was im@@ mer@@ ci@@ ful .
witnesses took note that polic@@ emen were shot on zig un@@ armed protest@@ ers and killed .
moving across the protests regarding the protests , pres@@ um@@ ably from the last or beginning of this year , such as vulner@@ abilities are young people with sho@@ cks , while they were forced to make a hand against a wall .
the chief of the UN Food Safety Agency for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this land together and will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa from the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is after Nigeria the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopia in order to fight counter terrorism across the region , particularly in Somalia . just a few countries in Africa , if at all , obtain such a lot of Western help .
Ethiop@@ ian Economy is expanded at the considerable pace .
its infrastructure has advanced dramatically - there is a new pend@@ ul@@ um in the capital of Ad@@ dis Abe@@ ba .
the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have consistently led the supp@@ ression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited , whereas the presi@@ dents have become effective .
many were killed in exile or in prison , or were driven into the wilderness of the wilderness .
but this could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you press people and have no other options except to protest , it breaks off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lec@@ turer in the central town of Ethiop@@ ians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth were protest@@ ed .
a generation was protest@@ ed .
there are numerous dis@@ comforts that cover everything from the soil usage to the stran@@ gl@@ ehold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition .
after a further critic@@ ised election of last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the Opposition , and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , the tensions continue along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a struggle for this pron@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo @-@ Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden have been imposed in recent years more or less , the tur@@ mo@@ il benefit and re@@ arms themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of cr@@ unch under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harmless : smart phones .
only in recent years a lot of Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with social media , since cheap smartphones were becoming more common and improved the Internet services .
even if the government un@@ lock the access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , above all in protests , do many people still communicate about internet @-@ pro@@ x@@ ies , conce@@ al where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ians had passed that they gathered together on protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity among the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ nic@@ ities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons the Am@@ har@@ as , who origin@@ ate from Ä@@ th@@ op@@ ia , predomin@@ antly of Christian high@@ lands , in politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and within low@@ land @-@ areas live .
but even this is changing just .
&quot; we are thereby to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the largest protests found in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is ceas@@ ef@@ ly domin@@ ating from members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray that are currently domin@@ ating around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military , in commerce and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was up to his death on a non @-@ terrestrial disease of the year 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian prime minister .
he was regarded as tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think around the corners .
anal@@ ysts say that he was especially sealed at this , early indication of dis@@ satisfaction and use special instruc@@ tors to edit opponents and make them in@@ harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is lacking in this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict @-@ analytical . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen relatively un@@ gu@@ arded reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiop@@ ian , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am came from the south .
anal@@ ysts are saying that he does not have the confidence of the security services provided by the Tig@@ ray controlled safety services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia was going to protest such a rebel@@ lion in 2005 , after thousands against elections were protest@@ ed , according to data from analy@@ st , seem@@ ingly were apparently cur@@ ated and stolen by the government .
during the following swe@@ eps were killed many protest@@ ers , although there were less than in recent months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively fast .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; development experts praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , like the new comm@@ eller , as well as their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but obviously this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ si@@ fication of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month of the protest in gon@@ dar , a am@@ orous city , by Tig@@ ray @-@ guided shops and the p@@ ass compared to the Tig@@ ray in the social media is more and more commonly practiced .
anal@@ ysts say that protests the U.S. and other Western allies come to a peculi@@ ar position .
Ethiopia as the basis for Dr@@ on@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even though they have recently stated that it has closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want its allies in a already vol@@ at@@ ile area collap@@ sing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declared his asser@@ tion against Obama was founded &quot; Sar@@ kas@@ mus , &quot; Sar@@ kas@@ mus . &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday holding his campaign , by att@@ acking his multiple repeated claim , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State , not serious .
this clar@@ i@@ fies new questions concerning the communication skills of the Presi@@ dents rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , whether he is able to communicate clear and comprehen@@ sible to the American public .
it also brings his comrades to take an effort into protecting him during an un@@ event@@ ful period , to explain in the peculi@@ ar position , statements that he could not have meant .
after having made the announcement of an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump was back with regard to the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted that he really did not intended to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but in a morning twe@@ et he said on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply sar@@ cast@@ ically .
the twe@@ et was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the alleg@@ ation completely seriously .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh H@@ iv@@ t , Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to weak@@ en the statement something to weak@@ en the statement that Mr. Obama wants to destroy it , the Republi@@ can candidate , wanted nothing to know of it .
the last storm of the criticism pr@@ as@@ sel@@ t on Mr. Tr@@ ump while he is trying to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches for the economic situation in Michigan in this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this issue .
by using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ ton could lead to higher taxes and that he found his speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has taken Sar@@ kas@@ mus to its defense .
in late July he passed strong criticism on himself , when he said the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clin@@ ton E@@ mails , but he explained later &quot; of course I said the sar@@ cast@@ ic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the boundaries in politics and then return home to demand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of its methods to test how certain messages came from his fans , how they arrive , and if necessary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Tyler , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in several ways .
instead of shar@@ pen@@ ing the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted an even engra@@ ved tone since his pol@@ ls have gone further .
a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , who was released on Friday , showed a tour with a big jump into the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is in general tries to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative expres@@ sions , he often accused his critics to dist@@ or@@ ate his statements or to understand his hum@@ our .
but while he is strengthening the attention of attention in recent months of its presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps Scher@@ ze has brought its loyal involvement into the in@@ convenient situation to stand independently of how pro@@ voc@@ ative may also be his statements .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of the most famous inter@@ rog@@ ators , had great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think what he says is legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani he asked about the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ umps , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had already established the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that Obama ISIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called her back @-@ gro@@ wer , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq .
most of the mainstre@@ am Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans attempt to argue that the government served under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as an Ou@@ ter minister , it allowed ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressi@@ vely under control .
before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump put his attacks on the media , and cast them to ride in each of his words , and to be pres@@ sur@@ ised against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he loved the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats read about Mr. Tr@@ umps Ent@@ schul@@ digung as only another proof that he may be in@@ appropriate for the presidential office .
once more than the price of the market comes back to Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a s@@ hab@@ er café in William@@ sburg , where you could pay only cash that had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices from its Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front has been displ@@ aced .
the store So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , replaced by Ver@@ b in summer 2014 , sold so@@ ap in the form of C@@ up@@ cakes .
locals ro@@ uted it as last loss in a gene@@ ous city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ist wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still do not believe CB@@ GB dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a so@@ ap store . &quot;
but if New York change is , then it is also new feeling .
a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted credit cards , but still has some of the same employees and a similar atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cis@@ co Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing member of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new cafes .
he started working in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered a customer to provide money for a new out@@ post , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , retained a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same Esp@@ res@@ om@@ asch@@ inen@@ model .
it even uses the same lamps out of the old Ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez saw that he also wanted to experiment .
he led new ingredients .
on the menu are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are yar@@ ns like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted oni@@ ons .
there are natural re@@ keys .
the café does not serve beer more , there are fresh juice .
after nine months Rodri@@ guez told that he noticed a steady stream of ancient tri@@ b@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers have also been displ@@ aced by prices from William@@ sburg &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca was a such customer .
Oliveira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly .
even after turning to Green@@ point , she would take the way up .
after the Ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coff@@ et@@ r@@ ink , she said .
&quot; I realized that it was the coffee and the culture in the Ver@@ b that liked me , &quot; she told me . &quot;
now drink coffee , even if they set off at this day instead of their usual I@@ ced coff@@ ees a Bl@@ ended C@@ hai tea , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before the work and stood still the same thing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss tor@@ o &apos;clock and they prepare for Every@@ thing Bag@@ el with butter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said , he wanted to experiment with and add new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal can still get its usual order , but sometimes it changes his Every@@ thing Bag@@ el with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he had no gro@@ ove on it , that the so@@ ap @-@ shop has taken the old business room .
actually , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie to make a special so@@ ap for ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bed coffee of the cafes as an ingredient .
&quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez .
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu to Polish and Rodri@@ guez told him to put them back soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome .
the site also has other advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ store would like to fill the cold @-@ bed coffee to bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the cafe was expanding on a nearby building .
for many customers a new one is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was ap@@ pre@@ m@@ ology and said that he was destroyed at the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the refu@@ ge of the local and the beast felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to cra@@ w@@ l , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ample meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascent to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as gour@@ mets , President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a Fai@@ ble for refined Del@@ ik@@ at@@ essen the Fif@@ th Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water @-@ tortie soup .
its menu on this day was something modest : filled eggs in Tom@@ at@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ aster p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with lei@@ gh people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the American as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histor@@ ian .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treated from Chinese cuisine in the USA while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about living in a residential home on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A decent Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published on Tuesday in the Har@@ per Verlag , illustr@@ ates the history of the American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed culinary solidarity when she meet with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , sn@@ apped snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which is already in business since the IP@@ O crash in 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh k@@ äs@@ es@@ and@@ wich with olive trees , while co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with m@@ ashed and vegetable painting .
when the re@@ porter Hack@@ br@@ aten , this found the couple for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was pe@@ an@@ uss@@ bread , liver cheese and Boh@@ nen@@ bro@@ t .
they were prepared from an ingredient and somewhat cheap , which stretched out the ingredient .
imagine so many cru@@ ts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ e gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has to have put itself in the stomach as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years ahead of Great Depression there was the table in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
cre@@ ws of women co@@ cks for male field@@ worker and it was fresh@@ ly baked past@@ ete for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paints the paths that the country went with it , no longer be the Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ en@@ land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was a time when eating for Americans was a central theme , &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
just as ten@@ se the new budget@@ ary was found : myst@@ eries such as lo@@ aves and bo@@ ars were re@@ juven@@ ated to stap@@ le food as a &quot; wonderful way , eating space , &quot; mer@@ ged Zi@@ egel@@ man , because ch@@ efs could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a kre@@ mi@@ gen Sau@@ ce .
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheap dr@@ ills .
meat , which was for years the center of the American food was , has become a very rare luxury .
peculi@@ ar mix@@ tures have been tried , as a high @-@ cal@@ orie and nour@@ ishing preference has had to taste or even a healthy kitchen .
during her research for the book , the recipe also includes , prepared Zi@@ egel@@ man a dish from this epoch , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; it was no more popular add on mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e .
Zi@@ egel@@ man leads further out : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked oni@@ ons are not fit together .
it was typical for many of the business recipes .
as never before or ever since , the household carrier - including Louise Stan@@ ley , director of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country is strange .
by published R@@ eci@@ pes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; budget@@ ary co@@ aches &quot; and the challenge to transform r@@ amp like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ r@@ ots into delicious meals .
&quot; a Square - &quot; is a celebration of historical ti@@ d@@ bits .
in particular , the reports on the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , like President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ C@@ ake @-@ attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa Farm@@ house in his kitchen , he became as the milli@@ on@@ ous man of the world he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost missed dining room and contributed a sm@@ king .
he was wonderfully diverse .
President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to stat@@ ute with his stomach .
as described in the book , the recru@@ iting of a house@@ ke@@ eper with no interest in flav@@ ours by Ms Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt that the White House brought forth the boring meal in Washington but also one of the most widely used . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , with food was dis@@ car@@ ded as soon as the country came back to legs .
the primary focus is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as how science on food was applied .
the couple gave over the writing of the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s father @-@ in @-@ law was better understood - for example like they could not throw out food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man reminded : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did actually get sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were the wind exploitation .
after the plate were lo@@ wer@@ ed at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they moved and co@@ e a dessert , which they had prepared at home : the pl@@ aster , the president Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt ate to noon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a nasty trick , hum@@ ble recipes to be missed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no ran@@ ged cream , just pl@@ aster , some flour , sugar , water and c@@ innam@@ on .
everybody de@@ af a bit re@@ lu@@ ct@@ antly a spo@@ on in the tough , brown extrem@@ b one .
surprisingly , it is not bad .
co@@ e hol@@ s three times a supplement .
like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped rolls would help . &quot;
in the bom@@ bs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he sat his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to rescue others .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old was dead in a fa@@ ç@@ al attack by the Assad regime .
Om@@ ar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group , which had saved the lives according to Bild @-@ Newspaper .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own life to play in order to educate people from sm@@ ashed houses and to provide first aid to the war .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
Om@@ ar was the face of the group : a video of civil servants , which shows him during a 11 @-@ hour rescue of an inf@@ ants from the ruins of a house , 2014 went around the world .
it made the Syri@@ ans for the radi@@ ator mas@@ cot of the Gre@@ ys of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as a hero he has never seen himself , said loud , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I die to save lives , I think that God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
shortly before Om@@ ar fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ bing ra@@ ids in Syria .
the helic@@ opter have turned four store@@ bom@@ bs over the Al@@ za@@ dia district , one was filled with chlor@@ gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now remove the toxic remains of the bom@@ b so that no children are playing with them , &quot; the picture quot@@ ed his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bom@@ b of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .

only when it arrives , acceler@@ ates the five meters long animal on sat@@ te 2,6 km / h - and is half as fast as an seals .
this of lon@@ eliness flour@@ ished li@@ fest@@ yles seems to be a pan@@ acea for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate from Green@@ land@@ hai , which could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ err@@ lein from Max @-@ Plan@@ ck @-@ Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock to this life @-@ span that means for vert@@ eb@@ rates a world record .
although the evolution@@ ists thought long that Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie are rock @-@ old .
only failed the evidence .
Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie are hard to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea from the sk@@ inny co@@ asts of Canada , Green@@ land , Norway and Sp@@ its@@ bergen .
because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius , they usually dive on the surface only in winter .
about the lifestyle of the Green@@ land@@ us know researchers according to little .
their time pent@@ ine ble@@ ak them , when they sh@@ ank six animals with a transm@@ itter in front of the S@@ val@@ bard .
lo@@ ot still make this shar@@ ks : in the stomach of a animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , a different one had swal@@ lowed the ja@@ w of a young polar bear .
possibly they sleep sle@@ ep@@ y animals or pat@@ rol on the basis of the ice age and look for Kad@@ ets , which from higher water layers to lower below .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Green@@ land or S@@ val@@ bard as to catch the depth of the North Atlantic Ocean .
the smallest h@@ ai was only 81 centi@@ meters long , while the largest is 5@@ 02 centi@@ meters .
to determine the age of animals , they analysed with the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ method the lin@@ ens of the shar@@ ks .
this centre of the eyel@@ id is already born before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which in it the proteins are later not renewed .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had remarkable lots of carbon @-@ 14 in the lin@@ ens .
her birth should therefore lie after the early 19@@ 60s , when nuclear w@@ aff@@ en@@ tries larger amounts of this radi@@ o@@ active carbon into the atmosphere .
in which 220 centi@@ meters long the smallest animal contained the lin@@ ens from contrast to a small excess of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th anniversary in 2012 .
all major Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie had in their lin@@ ens against normal carbon @-@ 14 volumes that arises from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed an age of 335 years for a 4@@ 93 centi@@ metres long Green@@ land@@ hai , an age of 335 years , whereas the record @-@ shar@@ k could be even 3@@ 92 years old with 5@@ 02 centi@@ meters .
that Green@@ land@@ hai females become only then desc@@ ended , when they are longer than four meters were known .
now , the researchers of the length could be assigned to old age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centi@@ meters are probably at the thres@@ hold of the sex ri@@ pe and his age was determined with 156 years , Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie can be obviously at least one and a half centuries time .
even this is likely to be Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord for vert@@ eb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence .
also the previous record @-@ holder , a 211 year old Green@@ land@@ w@@ al , put up in his bac@@ on at the neck a 120 year old Har@@ pun@@ ish l@@ ace , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures it often runs the organism that live there on as@@ fl@@ ams .
so , they mature and s@@ lower slowly .
in order to keep warm up in cold water , the animals are often too large .
because the volume is growing much faster than its surface , by which the animal sheds stands out .
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much greater than in one gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives in dangerous and should focus on getting as many descendants as soon as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolution@@ ist bi@@ ologist &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary , a very big animal should be investing more into a long life on the other hand .
background in a double pack
with topics around the Gre@@ ys the municipal council has focused in the recent session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief the body adopted the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , the marketing of the younger counter@@ parts can start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
once the property management , par@@ z@@ elli@@ p@@ ity and con@@ cluding question could be clar@@ ified , the sale of plots in the housing areas &quot; road @-@ away &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area of Bin@@ der@@ straße ) , there is nothing more in the way of interested parties .
the com@@ bust@@ ion is convinced that the bish@@ ops in the rural and quiet residential @-@ community have equally appe@@ aling to young families and equipment for sen@@ iors alike .
as it says , construction will report immediately in the City Hall , about the awar@@ ding of the plots will likely be advised in its September session .
in order to further en@@ qu@@ ire further inquiries , related to the job creation , to be able to meet , decided to change the municipal council , which was first re@@ produced in the spring of this year into a sub@@ marine plan .
in the area of sub @-@ lar@@ lar@@ n , which is already proven in the area around two plots in the direction of state @-@ road 21@@ 12 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
the city on the Main , therefore , has the best opportunities in competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt is most from the Bre@@ xit V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of Kompet@@ enz@@ fel@@ dt &apos;s financial markets and real estate markets of I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is un@@ certain whether monetary houses should continue to operate from London from financial transactions throughout the EU .
for the so @-@ called EU Pass , they are now taking approval in the United Kingdom so far .
this just use major US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
the lob@@ b@@ ying &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; counts with 10000 new jobs in the Main bin@@ nen five years .
for Frankfurt , so the I@@ W , the registered office of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , united in its responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro zone , as well as further important authorities like the European Insurance Group of EI@@ RB .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) is head@@ quar@@ tered , but this is less significant for the financial industry than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the bank bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Luxembourg , a large fund industry , resulting in the infrastructure as well as Dublin for its infrastructure .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .
furthermore , points the city with slightly available commercial properties .
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder .
in addition , the Seine will also be the Mi@@ xed for first @-@ class commercial properties by 50 percent higher than the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt has a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the corporate consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city is standing on square seven , Luxembourg to No. 19 , Dublin on No. 33 and Paris on 37@@ th site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a question of pre@@ love : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; consequently the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Bre@@ xit calls for economic researchers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to do this , the power relations : in London worked under figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , at the end of 2015 around 14@@ 4000 people in the banking industry , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 .

in a cr@@ acking , Donald Tr@@ ump is hidden behind false pret@@ enti@@ veness and back@@ tracking with regards to his previous promises to publish its tax views .
it is common to post U.S. presidential data to publish their taxes , although they are not obliged to do so by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York busin@@ essm@@ an , and his lawyers have stated as a reason for his obj@@ ection to tax testing by the tax authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons elec@@ toral campa@@ ign@@ ing in Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , in relation to the publication of Presi@@ dential candidates &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Democr@@ at &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Clinton has already posted on the subject and published on Friday a video on the Internet , in the high @-@ high rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans Tr@@ ump claim his tax declaration .
on Thursday she spoke the theme also during a speech to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he re@@ jects all that has done every other president &apos;s candidate in recent decades and release his declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the multitude . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Polit@@ ico has reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or only very little taxes during the 1990s , and an economic journalist of the New York Times cited a number of tax hav@@ n and tax advis@@ ers , the details that this could still be the case .
governments have become an issue in the elec@@ toral campaign .
Clinton is also supporting a regulation that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and Investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ee that would make sure that individuals earn more than USD 1 million paying a tax exemp@@ tion of at least 30 % .
President Obama supports the proposal also .

the method has proved to be effective and the Honey@@ guide Foundation , who already had the idea to intensi@@ fy them together with the U.S. nature conservation , taking volunteers in villages in northern Tanz@@ ani@@ as trained to use a non @-@ violent square @-@ step method to protect their houses and harvest without destro@@ ying animals .
previously , many speakers have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the telephone day dedicated to the animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ...

Jewish director cerem@@ onies Berlin hotel , because Israeli pre@@ selection has been removed after the &quot; Arab &quot; so@@ lic@@ itation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ folded a media monitoring , after having married that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had no Israeli pre@@ selection since it would have requested arab@@ ic guests according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , author of the Holocaust Doc@@ umentation &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger in Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay Lan@@ z@@ mann tried to find Israel on the site @-@ wide list of hotels .
however , the country was not listed between the countries that can be directly called out of the hotel room .
how is it in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lan@@ z@@ mann .
instead the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol has an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scho@@ cked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel was said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear decision of the management of any Kemp@@ inski Hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason that it stood , cle@@ ust out in the director even more anger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees of Lan@@ z@@ mann was quot@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli amb@@ assador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov h@@ ada @-@ Commerce , this was a &quot; great shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were de@@ pl@@ ased and troub@@ led by this event .
this is really very embarrassing .
the fact that this is based in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater shame .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident cle@@ ave a pretty big response in the internet where people called the whole a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some supported the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that it could have given the alle@@ ged demands of Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mel@@ ted , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it was said in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located on the pos@@ h Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a Synago@@ gue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly did all alleg@@ ations of himself and called the incident &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; at Lan@@ z@@ mann , reports The mirror . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there never was a direct instruction , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel not able to record in the quick selection list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the di@@ alling code has now been added .

according to the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian Ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade of trade between Moscow and T@@ ehr@@ an in the year comparison to 7@@ 0.9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest in Russian companies in the country grew strongly in the country , informed the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors .
Russian companies have established existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
of course , the further trade of trade is one of the largest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan .
he mer@@ ged that the sales approach between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , the Russian imports in Iran grew by 9@@ 1.5 per cent , and dec@@ ayed $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade mark was reached by supplies of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the mess@@ enger .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes for this year from an record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year the Russian foreign representatives gave around 35.@@ 000 vis@@ as , primarily in travel , Iranian citizens .
furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries , which concerns the tourist count in Russia .
one could say that the record numbers of Irish tourists in Russia last year , broken , &quot; he said .
at the same time only relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something that the amb@@ assador found it to change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ raz and Y@@ az@@ d who received Mon@@ uments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last evening in the monastery team in Rio to glory , when the British team def@@ ends the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glas@@ go@@ w took the an@@ chor@@ age , who had made his country &apos;s son Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the J@@ ump and made the legend proud , when he went home to take a win from the favor@@ ites New Zealand .
great Britain claimed a sho@@ cking victory over four years ago while Ho@@ y was the fifth of six Olympic @-@ medals .
they reiter@@ ated the trick after they took place in March at the train World Championships in London despite the return of Ho@@ ys , only one hum@@ ble place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver of Jamie Staff .
they did so well in time as to Hin@@ ge .
Ho@@ ys retirement rus@@ hed a gap , the K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton sear@@ ched .
Sk@@ inner was the man where they remained when they had potential in the vill@@ i that un@@ fol@@ ds now .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who won four years ago with Ho@@ y - and Sk@@ inner in the qualifying rounds , but in the Stand@@ ar@@ dr@@ unden won the New Zeal@@ ander in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his lap he was just back , but he brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner thought .
a Strateg@@ ic change made a great deal of transformation at that added in a higher gear to slow it down and enable them to keep pace the pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as the BBC expert and fell in Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when he step@@ ped onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year old Sk@@ inner from Glas@@ go@@ w said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am just here to do my best and to make a name for me .
in the En@@ dr@@ unde we have placed an Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord and the World Champion is defeated .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the tri@@ umph of 2012 at the page Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , saying that he fell on the path after a weak start .
he returned to this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ des said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels with the whole GB flags on the ble@@ ach@@ ers like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have come together as a team in the last three months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we came so bad with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympi@@ ad again .
this is an event , a gold med@@ al for the nation , which won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if the barrel of our progress over the past five months is , we expect a successful five days in the bicycle flow .
with the form of characteristic , it is in the area of Pos@@ sible that he has repeated the victory of three Olympic gold medals in a contest .
this would be born for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y who was also born on 23 March ( a apparently holy date for British sports ; on the day there were Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster ) - a yield between six gold medals and a silver med@@ al .
the cheese of the Ho@@ y is the same .
Kenn@@ y is taking part in the Sprint that begins today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely , to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ des said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be defeated a k@@ nights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ ed competition of the day , but there were more good news for England .
Sir Br@@ adly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified themselves with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four kilometers race .
you came in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
the Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord , who won in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22 @-@ 42 ) can be held on the second day of competition , at the Wig@@ gins .
he had cont@@ est@@ ed himself yesterday with representatives from the qualification as the function@@ aries called for him to measure his body size .
in the course of the competition , the future continues and ended , av@@ anci@@ ed Laura Tr@@ ott , Jo@@ anna DM@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in world time period in 4 : 13.@@ 260 .
the UK team reli@@ es on his strong rail team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a bow@@ el of medals .
after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were shut down .
they played Dr@@ amas in the background , so the retirement of the technical leadership Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April in the middle of Sex@@ is@@ mus@@ - and mo@@ bs as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ leton .
but if one sees the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ ro@@ me , it looks like that the legendary call GB@@ s , who has achieved his peak at the perfect moment to be repeated again .
the future of mel@@ ting forces from Port@@ land due to the lifting of the end @-@ day
the future of aluminium mel@@ t@@ down from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the system operator will announce the energy supplier contract and thereby up@@ lift all delivery orders , such as the running energy company .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria beginning of this year , no further subsidies for the operation of the plant .
a pay@@ out for 20 years is made in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the facility of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are available on the game .
not less than 2,000 jobs -@@ direct as well as indirect - could be at risk in closing .
in addition , it could come to domin@@ ating effects , as the mel@@ ting around 10 percent of the total electricity generation is consum@@ es .
2014 Al@@ coa , the Point Henry Schmel@@ z@@ ei , which led last year to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station .
the mel@@ ting forces of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and ris@@ ed a closure .
this step follows years of spec@@ ulations regarding the future of the complex , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the power price for the plant .
AG@@ L that supplies the large aluminum mel@@ ting together with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , shared with it that three more owners will announce their contracts .
the facility is in the multilingual possession of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , from which the Chinese company CI@@ TIC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p lower ant@@ rop@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Port@@ land will continue to run , which means more physical demand for electricity by mel@@ ting means &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; divided the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ H also said that the Tre@@ aties will be so called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; securing transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which will come into force from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts will have a 12 months of notice period so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to the revenue in the financial year 17 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the power supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on AG@@ L &apos;s earnings on AG@@ M from the G@@ J 18 are currently restricted by the forecasts of strong terminals for wholes@@ ale prices .
AG@@ L shared the value of the contracts already written in its annual closure of $ 187 million in &quot; expectation of an dism@@ iss@@ al . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability of Alco@@ as ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to operate the mel@@ ting power or guarantee the power supply at the mel@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. company said that 2010 has concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have come into effect from November this year , even if there is still a statement , why it came back to the contract .
anal@@ ysts war@@ n due to the poor economic relations of the industry before the possible closing of the Port@@ land mel@@ ting in Victoria and the tom@@ ago complex in New@@ castle .
in reference to the statements of anal@@ ysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land enters around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and Tom@@ ago about 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity .
should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as power generators you would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a car@@ b@@ ent Re@@ ality @-@ TV , Bandera is on the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ ment of the Vo@@ gue
Bandera J@@ ator , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ ator C@@ lan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the co@@ v@@ eted Sept@@ ember@@ ment of the US Vo@@ gue .
Kendall , the brand amb@@ assador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran to the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agram account .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , brought me the sight of this Co@@ vers to tears , &quot; wrote Bandera .
the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a Bible ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an &apos;s similar ? ) , soci@@ et@@ ected Re@@ ality video , which ends the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an un@@ cle and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) as they end the cover of her sister and ends with a classic turn : they all planned a surprise party .
this represents the kl@@ ish@@ ee@@ able act of almost every birth@@ days of a children &apos;s return ( se@@ ac@@ rest brought the phrase , &quot; You said that we would have forgotten ? &quot; with the honest@@ y of a sign on a Sen@@ de@@ platz at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to take part in this publicity .
with a view to the Sept@@ ember@@ ment of the Vo@@ gue also has started a new era of the car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans .
Kend@@ alls large sister Kim likes to have struck what the Vo@@ gue cover , be@@ aten ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West went to see in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ ment of the magazine is a League for itself .
the sept@@ embre is for Vo@@ gue , which is most of the most sought after edition of the year .
with a circum@@ ference , which resem@@ bles rather a picture band as a fashion magazine , the output moves a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista , from the 8@@ 32 pages of cop@@ zers 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the unveil@@ ing of its Cover@@ stars will be so longing for over the last two years of the magazine or before the official announ@@ cements .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celebr@@ ities , the mod@@ elling &quot; as &quot; Mod@@ els , &quot; celebr@@ ities are &quot; on the cover .
Oscar @-@ lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or @-@ hall@@ amb@@ assador Jennifer Lawrence has been on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
but even at the small chance that Mrs. J@@ ator - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - among the earlier categories , it is in good company .
these celebr@@ ities are not related to famous people or Re@@ ality stars or youth from today , who know how to turn out a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if all of them applies to the denomin@@ ator ) .
they are really talented women who exc@@ el themselves in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once appeared on the last cover , with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade was one of the most successful years of her career .
naturally Jenn@@ ers like success not everyone .
with its reality @-@ TV history , Jenn@@ ers was always somewhat ten@@ se in the fashion world .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ ator and their colleagues in Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called it &quot; the mist@@ resses of the moment . &quot;
these feelings can be again high , when the message with the creator Jenn@@ ers came out on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but on the s@@ nat@@ ch , it seems to pass on point at the point .
CROSS @-@ denomin@@ ator is based on the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ ment of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters will sell you pictures of yourself on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
it sells of her paintings by Cindy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in their free time she is in Re@@ ality TV to see . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
con@@ greg@@ ates centers over 16@@ 0,000 people annually
more than 16@@ 0,000 the aid boxes of the country are rejected each year by the municipal centers , while the sector has already transferred to the effects of further middle ab@@ brevi@@ ations on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Queensland three of 5 people - mostly older people , immigrants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for real dolph@@ ins and similar have been rejected in their search for free legal advice and legal advice .
legal services of the con@@ gregation , which are already covered , are ready for further cuts .
as of June next year , this legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding .
the director of the coun@@ tri@@ bun@@ als of Que@@ en@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Gemein@@ der@@ ech@@ ts@@ centres revealed that thousands of people will be refused to thousands of people each year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rell said that the situation would be worse without a lift of the German government to be worse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Queens@@ lands simil@@ arities centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people of important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and er@@ op@@ pressing debt , families that were released by break@@ down - all these people have problems legal and this survey shows that they may not get the help they need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government will be cut by 30 per cent from June 2017 , which means that thousands of need@@ y people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we call for the general attorney and federal judicial Minister as well as Sen@@ ators of Queensland , George Bran@@ dis , to raise these mid@@ ations immediately , so people can get the help they need to receive legal problems .
last year , the provincial government met its commitment to raise funds for guidance on the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of community centers and their customers , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government is invested in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump campaign campaign was indic@@ ted by staff supp@@ os@@ edly gun
new York : Donald Tr@@ umps campaign was indic@@ ted for alle@@ ged in@@ activity since she has been told that her campaign for North Carolina in February gave a fire@@ arm to an employee while travelling on a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in a indic@@ t@@ ment which was submitted on Wednesday at the Landes@@ gericht von Charlotte by Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software program for the campaign in this federal state .

after having established himself at the local and regional campaign direc@@ tor@@ ate , Bord@@ ini had realized that at least four more people had made the same experience with Philli@@ p , he gave in the indic@@ t@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be rep@@ ented to cause damage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave Bord@@ ini to us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the indic@@ t@@ ment comes only two days after the Republi@@ can candidate , a rebel@@ lion of North Carolina said that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment people &quot; - Sch@@ uss@@ bo@@ aff@@ en@@ owner and ceas@@ ef@@ ire should take actions if its Riv@@ aly@@ Hill@@ ary Clinton should be elected and judge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; separ@@ umps campaign was clear that the media would have left his words out of the context and that he would not rise to violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
be@@ ordin@@ is complaint calls for damages from the campaign for violation of due di@@ ligence services and by Philip because of bodily injury and ab@@ norm@@ ative damage .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey of countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , there are considerable losses for the government of government and CD@@ U .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this award @-@ representative surveys of the free research institutes IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government Coalition could not go@@ vern in the north only , this is not possible after the demand in Berlin .
in both federal states , the SPD would be the most powerful party and therefore would have good opportunities to continue to get the Prime Minister .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD increased from 35,@@ 6 percent to 24 percent to 24 percent .
the party bl@@ ends with that according to survey only just before the CD@@ U that could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is disp@@ uted between the left and the Af@@ for@@ ter .
the left wing on 19 percent ( before 18.@@ 4 per cent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s day .
the Gre@@ ens are somewhat lighter , in spite of mild losses with 6 percent ( before 8,@@ 7 per cent ) again in the Schwer@@ iner of Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented by 3 percent in the country .
in the Berlin consultation of the survey , the SPD of the survey was estimated that only 23 percent ( choice 2011 : 28,@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
thus she saw the Green with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 per cent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented with 14 per cent for the first time in the dep@@ uty @-@ service store .
with 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope to return a return , the pirates would not miss the one against them in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9@@ 110@@ i Communicator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in Tim@@ lu@@ pe : over 20 years ago , the Nokia Communicator USB has been on the market .
the followers today domin@@ ate the world - his manufacturer lived a disaster .
the device is almost half a kil@@ ogra@@ m and was more than four@@ teen as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thick@@ er and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was quite swi@@ f@@ ful .
the built @-@ in memory was at the beginning eight meg@@ abyte , which would be rich today for about two sel@@ enium with high resolution .
a iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 Gig@@ abyte .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , into the business - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros enthusiasts can buy the devices on the internet , but they somehow come from the St@@ one@@ age of the Internal Market .
however , a sensation was a sensation of 20 years ago .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before at the computer trade fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as an office in the West@@ ent@@ asch@@ en@@ format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for dam@@ aging standards a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator .
even access to websites was possible by using HTML browsers , al@@ beit squee@@ zing slow .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital add@@ ress@@ book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small ant@@ enna , and the mobile phone could be st@@ owed similar to a laptop .
then there was a little keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
quite proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 Euro .
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was in 2015 at 3@@ 92 Euro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody could ap@@ point in August 1996 , that the abolition of the beginning of the smartphone era would be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
the Handy @-@ Sp@@ arte der Fin@@ nen inv@@ ent an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold in Microsoft and closed .
the market today domin@@ ate providers , that all came much later than Nokia .
be online and everywhere online , this is today for a very many people of everyday life .
in 2015 , there have been nearly two billion smart phones worldwide .
sold around 1.4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple Un@@ its alone are 5@@ 55 million pieces .
the worldwide sales of the equipment is roughly 400 billion euros .
to do this , the well @-@ ongoing business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications concert will come .
around the smartphone has now been created a whole industry .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market was started at the beginning of 2007 , announced Apple Chef Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World &apos;s introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he spoke three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet @-@ communication , all per touch @-@ screen easy to use .
the winner of Apple began , still today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry who ruled the market had to see .
you disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the s@@ cars now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after his invention a matter of fact .
in the in@@ cis@@ ion , each German now looks for 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all have to learn to set the smartphone , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; just said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens Board of Management for personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a cur@@ se and a blessing at the same time .
England must channel the Olympic spirit and expand he@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will not only be held in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity .
for me it represented the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ rows , just as it was in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefit from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and we will reach this again by creating new possibilities for local and firms near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities we will already have 10,000 new apprentic@@ es already to create 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of enlargement He@@ ath@@ rows is too big .
I was told that England will never be ready for the Games and that we will be bl@@ amed on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had no in@@ justice and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ ath@@ row answers each one every asked question .
how the Olympic Games is He@@ ath@@ row for many and not for single infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in funny growth and a legacy of skills and employment both at the airport and across the UK .
we have implemented a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has been implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure program in time and budget held by T5 - last five years as a result of the world &apos;s best airport pick , up to T2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequ@@ ented run@@ ners of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to ste@@ er this Olympic spirit and extend he@@ ath@@ row as well as our future trade and create a legacy of skill and employment , to be proud of England .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ atz @-@ und Maus@@ spiel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of ad lock &quot; &quot; &quot;
for companies , who earn money with online @-@ based earning money , according to one of the software packages , ad @-@ block effects , one &quot; cat@@ al@@ - and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would also block sco@@ oter on its des@@ k@@ top@@ site , released Ad@@ block Plus a blog post , in which it rus@@ hed to upgrade their filters in the program to block again advertisement inside the social network .
on Tuesday shared Facebook with that his Des@@ k@@ top@@ site would change the co@@ ding on its advertisements , in order to inv@@ ig@@ ate it &apos;s ad recognition , which is part of the site advertising is difficult to detect .
but Ad@@ block proclaimed that it has found a new way to b@@ yp@@ ass the new code .
in a blog@@ post wrote the speaker of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this type H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er @-@ battle between the sco@@ red open source community and the Um@@ ern already has been underway since the invention of ad players , and that it is possible that Facebook is soon to come with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world @-@ largest company has left for social media in the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying ad players for the industry become . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study from the last year of Pag@@ ef@@ air and Adobe some 200 million people sco@@ red sco@@ red ; almost four times so much 2013 .
with bi@@ ased billions of active users who access Facebook over their mobile devices , hand@@ y@@ wer@@ bung has 84 percent of the advertising fac@@ ebook .
the company has it on display block on desktop PCs as mobile indicator block its effect on fac@@ ebook mobil@@ er app for the social network and inst@@ agram shared a spokes@@ man .
advertisement on desktop PCs makes a huge amount of revenue resulting in so that Facebook appears to invest such as rewar@@ ding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday shared Facebook with that it would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ viewing tool &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to gain more control over it on them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday noted Facebook that Ad@@ blocks had new filter wor@@ rying , because they would also block content on the page that are no advertising .
&quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we are planning to address the problem , &quot; shared a speaker of Facebook in an e @-@ mail message .
ad lock bra@@ king are a stupid tool , which is why we instead have concentrated on development tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , to lay more control over the hands of the people .

it is obvious that one of the Swiss in the age of 49 years ago , that was passing by several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry @-@ car , who himself would have to kill myself .
it died still on site .
several drivers have already heard , but some are still not identified , the police said this , as well as any witnesses of the incident to log in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a investig@@ ative trial opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , Gilles Hof@@ st@@ etter whom Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a conflict avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that must decide on the prosec@@ ut@@ or &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases have been showing in the last five years that the drivers will not be held accountable .
in each of the two cases - where a person ran out on the highway on the highway - was decided that the motor@@ ists do not assume that a pedestrian head runs in the middle of the night on the highway , as it was in the paper .
last year was acqu@@ itted a polic@@ eman of the ri@@ ver@@ able k@@ ill@@ ings after having passed a man and killed it was in August 2014 one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had dr@@ unk and was on the road un@@ conscious , took the court .
the court concluded that the police officers had responded to -- on a justified way -- on a justified way , saying that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; totally exceptional and un@@ fores@@ ee@@ able situation , &quot; said the judge .
everyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges , should register with the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NAS@@ A Klim@@ am@@ od@@ ell : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
Venus was probably hab@@ itable for the proj@@ ections of a new NAS@@ A climate model .
scientists at the Godd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NAS@@ A developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble climate researchers .
the model was designed to determine if Venus could have been associated with their hot , waterproof surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow l@@ utes of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation points out that Venus could have had a thin , inv@@ aded atmosphere and still slow down .
the model illumin@@ ates the to@@ po@@ graphy of early Venus .
the planet is pres@@ um@@ ably more dry areas than de earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and spread it even more rapidly .
the early Venus prof@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent mat@@ ter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS mod@@ elling simulation exp@@ on@@ ates the slow change of Venus her day@@ ess@@ side of the Sun almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick sli@@ der clouds , which acts like an umbrella , to shield the surface of a large part of the solar heating .
the result are average temperatures , which are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resem@@ bles the evolution that was previously thought of Plan@@ etary researchers .
although she was probably been inhab@@ itable , the Venus is exposed to many heat and ultra @-@ violet light in the course of several billion years .
their oceans st@@ ems and its water@@ v@@ ap@@ or was burned out of the ul@@ tra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ ge@@ wich has remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse gas back -- the Venus that we know it today .
the researchers investigated the results of their new Venus clim@@ am@@ od@@ ells at Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy performs as a trainer of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy step@@ ped back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations into the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a low @-@ determination process for the decision @-@ making process of the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ less Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and mer@@ ged that the association will immediately search for a new coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the past three years I have been fulfilling my duties as chief trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations , the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che met with energy , passion and certainty , &quot; says the 50 @-@ year of Roy in an opinion .
in the course of summer , I thought how I could improve this team to give him more depth to lend it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations must be perfectly tailored to the organization .
he also has to have a co @-@ determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are not currently being fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , who had been consul@@ ted by Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thanks to him for his contributions for the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he did for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy was honoured during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Ad@@ ams Awards as the best coach of the League .
it led the association to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was be@@ aten in the first round of the Pl@@ a@@ yo@@ ffs of Min@@ nes@@ ota and missed the post@@ season in each of the last two years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches reported in the 2015 @-@ 16 a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the game for a second Wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference for five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart won multiple Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ ler resume talks again , set a strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles regarding the wage wage for North @-@ oil workers are exposed , while all the force parties will place for a new round of discussions at the table , they said negoti@@ ators &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strike against the oil @-@ service providers Wood Group were made spor@@ a@@ dic@@ ally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the un@@ ites and trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to rest@@ art the winding process of the current dispute &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is said in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will keep some day @-@ day meetings in the next weeks , which will start the early next year to address the problems .
the trade unions said that their last strike is the first in over 25 years , a protest against possible pay@@ lines of up to 30 per cent .
Wood Group awarded the R@@ ats to his contrac@@ tors in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the advice of the company follows a 10 @-@ percentage decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company have the needed space to come through the market swing .
Shell has released and plans for its part of thousands of people and plans to ex@@ pose its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it is his business activities as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ um@@ eration with British energy companies BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower in@@ oil prices under pressure , an economic situation which had been reinforced by the decision of the British in June , the European Union .
the Scottish parliament@@ arians Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leader in the beginning of this week to discuss one of the greatest unemployment disputes which had been taken place for a generation in the North Sea .
the Nord@@ see is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy which for many and not only a few works , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion euros will be expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of roughly $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation of stars in the clu@@ ster of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades
the most recent mission with the Ke@@ pler space tel@@ esc@@ ope has helped to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ation@@ rates under the stars of the star clu@@ ster of the Ple@@ j@@ ades .
the new data help to understand astronom@@ ers , why stars in the star clu@@ sters at different rates , as well as in what are the rotation @-@ time spaces with the planetary development process .
&quot; we hope that through the compar@@ isons of our results with other star@@ ry , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s infr@@ ared processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the clu@@ ster of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is located 4@@ 45 light @-@ years from the earth .
many stars in this star clu@@ sters that emerged above 125 million years ago , reaching the adul@@ th@@ ood .
it is now at the fastest .
for top @-@ grade rates this int@@ enti@@ onal stars find great amounts of star@@ ches .
since these winds of the stars travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
when a star is alter@@ ing , its rotation is starting to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of any star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of an recogni@@ z@@ able con@@ stellation -- how to recognise the spots .
the recent catalog of rot@@ ation@@ rates points out that a lot of stars are turning lower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger and s@@ lower pi@@ rou@@ ts are turning smaller than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of Ple@@ j@@ ades , we see that slow d@@ ress@@ ors lead to be massive , whereas intense rot@@ ors lead to be very bright stars , &quot; said Re@@ ull .
since the clu@@ sters of the Ple@@ j@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ide@@ alistic cosmic lab , to compare stell@@ ar qualities as rot@@ ation@@ rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clu@@ ster of Ple@@ j@@ ades offers an an@@ chor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Re@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is still a lot ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how the How , when and why stars slow@@ down their rot@@ ation@@ rates , and so speak their &quot; dancing shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in three reports in detail about their latest analysis of the Ple@@ j@@ aden report , which will soon appear in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ Star to go
the tears ran by Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the U.S. Bas@@ eball star in the best days of base to base .
according to his emotional return trip , the 41 year old professional will be held on 12 August against the Tamp@@ a Bay R@@ ays the last time the Tri@@ k@@ ot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say &quot; Good@@ bye &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stated the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ game @-@ Parti@@ cip@@ ants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable player of the League , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series .
his signature under a ten @-@ year deal has been compl@@ ained by 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
by the end of the cont@@ ex@@ ts on 31 December 2017 , he is in future as a consultant and youth coach - with full content .
as a player paid it Rodri@@ guez long time with performance back .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 31@@ 14 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) , and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es made some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays show only two more bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics similar levels .
but in the closing hall of the bas@@ eb@@ alls the 41 @-@ year @-@ old might not be recorded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for so successfully Rodri@@ guez - nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - on the field , its appearance is disp@@ uted outside of the place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was transferred to the ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was locked in the so @-@ called Bi@@ ogen@@ esis sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 for 211 games .
Rodri@@ guez is considered to be a leading edge for years for an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida .
after a dispute the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favor for the year 2014 because I had played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez again sweet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his f@@ are@@ well @-@ days did not get lost .
while many bas@@ eball legends in their last games still get the big stage , Rodri@@ guez had to sit frequently on the bench .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job includes no f@@ are@@ well @-@ tour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; E@@ ven Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married with the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az was married and the conditions with pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress Kate will be re@@ printed , sympathy with fans of the Y@@ ash@@ ee arch@@ ival Boston Red So@@ x .

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en Xin@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Z@@ inski are the first D@@ op@@ aus@@ ages
being caught : because of a positive d@@ op@@ ting test , weights for Adrian destinations from Poland in Rio will not start .
Rio de Janeiro - Olympic Games 2016 will be over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official d@@ op@@ ing@@ cases .
for an inher@@ ited ath@@ am@@ ples had gotten almost a med@@ al .
ahead of the seventh competition , the first official d@@ op@@ ses are known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese Swi@@ mwear in Ch@@ en Xin@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter freight in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish weights for Adrian Dest@@ inski were tested in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the already critical pre@@ valent Ath@@ le@@ tics competitions are coming these messages to the unknown .
in Ch@@ en last Sunday , the di@@ ure@@ tics was detected by hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de , which is used as a mascul@@ ine agent for d@@ op@@ ters .
the International Sport@@ Court CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon time of their exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m butter@@ fly , only around 0.@@ 09 seconds they missed the bronze medals .
on Friday Ch@@ en would have to participate in the footh@@ ills about 50 m of style .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ sample at the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) and a hearing for a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association should take the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demands of Ch@@ en full co @-@ operation at the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited Xin@@ long from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ Court CAS and will accept the verdi@@ ct . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history it is not the I@@ OC , but the CAS for the rehabilitation of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio sick@@ ened the message of the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa by , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went with it even in the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my four@@ ter test was positive , &quot; this is &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is inno@@ cent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is said to be the most forbidden substance around the blood @-@ dop@@ amine EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa has been pro@@ visional pro@@ o@@ ed , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample is supposed to be a positive one .
Bulgaria &apos;s prime minister Bo@@ ik@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w was immediately directed with criticism of the Ath@@ ali@@ zer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , about all weights from the chron@@ ically @-@ dop@@ eth@@ ic Nation do not participate in Rio .
on Friday also the case &quot; Adrian Dest@@ inski &quot; is also known , the London @-@ Olympi@@ ad winner in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive at the an@@ ab@@ ole ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
both flip the intake , however , are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg .
before the start of athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another severe blow to the reputation of the entire sport .
the World Association of IAAF had banned the whole Russian squ@@ ad to an exception because of systematic dating to the start , also the L@@ äu@@ er Kenya produced in Rio numerous bad news .
the swimming pool also had taken care of the earlier attempts in China for violent conflicts also between athletes .
in this way the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t took the Chinese Olympi@@ asi@@ eger Sun Yang &quot; per@@ ch .
&quot; sun Yang , purple . &quot;
&quot; if I see the podium about 200 m @-@ style , I want to hand over , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French Radio .
sun also stood at the center of an argument with the Austr@@ ali@@ ans H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was positive in 2014 with the Chinese Championships positively to the stim@@ ul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit only a three @-@ month lock .
data kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ pres@@ sen h@@ acker her sol@@ ran@@ som
programmers of comp@@ ress@@ ing mal@@ ware currently rely on targeted companies - and are successful in this process .
according to a recent survey conducted by Mal@@ ware @-@ Ab@@ wehr specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes amongst 540 companies in North America , the United Kingdom and Germany , 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies have at least once , partially several victims of a tac@@ tac@@ ke with Er@@ pres@@ ser software .
almost 20 percent of companies have already reached the target of a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware comp@@ ress@@ making .
40 percent of victims paid a will@@ ingly prepared by the perpet@@ rators to use the systems and data in order to be able to use the requested systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their Re@@ pres@@ ser software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes in attack on the attacks in the company &apos;s networks .
are they successful there , the potentially explosive ran@@ som is significantly higher than in private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a start@@ ling fast evolution of harm software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes manager Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ funds were still recommended to send advertising .
then discovered the offen@@ ders Er@@ press@@ .@@ Software for itself .
first , private users were the target , but the change to company att@@ acking took place in the past months sc@@ ary quickly .
R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware operates after a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim is active , she is searching for un@@ long altered files like Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as on archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ ted the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als lasting .
subsequently the software presents the demands of pressing .
to get the final code code into the files , the victims need money - usually in the form of the cryp@@ to@@ on Bit@@ coin .
yet , where in private users , the personal photo database is at stake , it concerns companies around sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage falls off when a r@@ ans@@ om@@ ware suggests .
22 percent of the affected German firms in their sales were reported by R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , 13 per cent even the business operations had to be completely dis@@ rupt , in case of one case people were in life .
in Germany already several hospitals were victims of attack , whose patients may be threatened by the loss of health acts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pays not , you only encourages the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay , get their data back .
for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpet@@ rators in the operation of breast@@ feeding .
the h@@ ackers again know this and try to build everything in order to build a good reputation .
in a recent study the security researcher from F @-@ Secure manages the user @-@ surfaces and contact with the pres@@ sur@@ ers and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually attemp@@ ting to establish a kind of customer service to adopt more money .
you will explain to their victims via chat , as they may pay by Bit@@ coin , direct access websites or de@@ code otherwise example files .
and private people are rede@@ emed by payments of a few hundred million Euros , companies have to negotiate some hard and five @-@ dig@@ it sums pay to get their data un@@ encryp@@ ted .
given the potentially high and relatively lower profits from the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware comp@@ ress@@ making , the h@@ acker gets more professional and share the work , explains Security experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the Anti@@ virus provider of Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware around within one week . &quot;
more likely , it is that it is about three or four persons .
the programmer sell their damage software in the form of a software design to the actual black@@ mail@@ ers .
the previous Mal@@ ware kits were created by the mal@@ ware , consulting and additional tools for a unique , solid price between 1,000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included is a adaptation tool , so that smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the pres@@ cri@@ ers then search for further h@@ acker to spread the fresh@@ ly sold software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so one is log@@ ged in one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a crime and asked another to install the software on the many PCs as possible .
the payment is made per ins@@ ulated calcul@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the crimin@@ als then bear with the spread &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Ou@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by now , the risk of R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is known by many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey have to rely on R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware using file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful treatment , thre@@ aten the perpet@@ rators instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer list or pricing , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes manager Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this , the potential for damages depending on the type of data is still a lot higher than before .
in future , the perpet@@ rators of the future could take completely new goals in the internet of things on the grain .
at the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrated safety scientists , as they could get a thermo@@ stat with the Internet under their control .
in the middle of winter the fri@@ ction of a so @-@ block heating of heating were certainly worth a ran@@ som worth .
if the offen@@ ders then instead of the heating in the future block a whole production street in a factory , R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware might also be subject to an issue in the industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and all @-@ friendly
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda will pack all : a little SU@@ V , a little coup@@ é and also the versat@@ ility of a min@@ iv@@ an .
sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform like the new jazz , pro@@ ving itself in daily life as extremely flexible .
although the only 1,60 m high HR @-@ V appears rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the front row as well as in the bond , it does not work in any place .
the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ top falls into something .
versatile as a comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a trunk @-@ room of 453 l with high @-@ featured back@@ rests , but it is available for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical as it sounds : the seat of the back bank can be up@@ loaded like kin@@ ks and thus offer storage space , which is from ground up to ceiling 1,@@ 24 m high .
the trunk area can be easily venti@@ l@@ ated , but the load @-@ height with 650 mm is slightly higher than at the same Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ l @-@ diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP speeds up the HR @-@ V , thanks to torque levels of up to 300 Nm in large scale areas very powerful .
however , he is likely to address a bit qui@@ eter for his work .
encouraging is the balance consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km .
there is another motor@@ ization : a 1.5 @-@ l @-@ gas@@ oline with 96 kW / 130 HP .
a wheel drive is not offered .
the behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
the ste@@ ering is likely to be a little more direct .
the equipment in the tested top version &quot; Executive &quot; cannot be desired .
to the security systems is the City @-@ Emer@@ bre@@ ms@@ assist@@ ent ( working until Tempo 32 ) , the coll@@ is@@ ions@@ war@@ n@@ system and the micro @-@ film auxili@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the coll@@ is@@ ions@@ war@@ ner irrit@@ ates sometimes because he will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; judged many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her@@ ed objects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very reliable works the Fern@@ Eco @-@ assist@@ ent .
and the intelligent tem@@ po@@ stim@@ ulator is responding to the transport detection and d@@ ros@@ sel@@ t in need of speed .
but the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI socket lying under the arm@@ rest and therefore are a bit aw@@ kward .
the approximately 29@@ 000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who do not want to invest so much will receive the gas@@ oline from 200@@ 00 euros , the diesel from € 23@@ 000 .
the engines will meet the Euro @-@ 6 emissions standard .
with HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and day @-@ friendly car .

sick holi@@ day@@ makers only get money after their journey when the cause of the disease is beyond doubt in the hotel .
but that is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests seem to show the same symptoms .
in this case a family was difficult to break down during the second day of their Turkish ur@@ king , difficult to di@@ arr@@ he@@ a and v@@ om@@ iting .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your condition led the holiday makers to a def@@ ective se@@ wage system that supp@@ os@@ edly has poll@@ uted the sea water . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the family was the view , the journey was with it a lack - and l@@ ament@@ ed against the organizer .
in court the br@@ ack@@ ets had no success .
in fact the frac@@ tory in fact was faul@@ ty .
but the promot@@ er was only just before leaving the br@@ ack@@ ets of it .
he had to go out to that the sea water was fine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not hurt his informations , so the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially as in the samples of the water no im@@ pur@@ ities have been found .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly through infection with one another - belonged to the general form of life .
the 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 mark@@ ers .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , after the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have worried about further recent attacks .
the state accounts and at the same time react to terrorist attacks .
sure : our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hat@@ red and split .
this tri@@ umph we will not give the terrorists .
if pen@@ ters would have to leave the country more quickly , it will be the safety and also the approval of the population for the refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve a realisation of the proposals by the Bundestag in 2017 .
he also announced another personal rein@@ forcement of the security forces , namely in medium @-@ sized dimensions over several years . &quot;
sympath@@ etic to terrorism are again under punishment .
video surveillance should be improved , which are not re@@ mod@@ ulated by the weapon , that mainly the purchase of weapons in the internet is complicated .
the last much discussed silence @-@ planted for physicians should be handed over to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to search for solutions in the dialogue with the in@@ cis@@ es , as the threat of citizens can be reduced , he said with a look at psychological ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act a radic@@ alization of refugees , the minister maintains a better social support .
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mat@@ ised people .
in the pursuit of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) plans de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning to be used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister of Minister expressed clearly against shareholders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this was a ear@@ ge for the hing@@ es at the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the spark ME@@ DI@@ ENG@@ RU@@ PP@@ E ( Friday ) .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union after a Bur@@ ka pro@@ hibition and the abolition of double citi@@ zenship previously .
a gener@@ ative ban on the full wear , it is un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able .

better transport flow on motorway exit
it is regularly located on the changing road - here is a picture of November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legal ab@@ rup@@ ture should be extended . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is good news for all cars drivers who stand in traffic traffic on the traffic road every night in the traffic street when they drive over the motorway Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the provincial operation is extended next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 aug@@ ust ) in the area between the hammer Street and the exit Wes@@ eler road the right @-@ off road to 700 meters .
motor@@ ists can then turn right from the hammer street to the right .
the major advantage : the traffic is divided up early @-@ time , whereby the overall sales process is improved on the multip@@ lied section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U fac@@ tion in the district council held in Münster @-@ West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the driving force on the Zu@@ br@@ inger is more nervous the drivers above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ days dates back to the bridge over the Alber@@ go road and sometimes also beyond .
the reason is the N@@ adel@@ öh@@ r on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler road .
from here the traffic can only be reached via the Motor@@ way@@ bridge .
the second track had to be returned to a three @-@ three years ago .
the reason : static comp@@ ut@@ ations had revealed that the bridge is no longer the necessary load power , in order to absor@@ b primarily the heavy @-@ duty traffic .
how long this eng@@ aging and the associated traffic jam is last allowed , the continuous state of state can not say .
however , with years to reck@@ on , for the bridge has an official use of use until the year 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal ab@@ b@@ esp@@ an the country @-@ owned company has been aware of the busi@@ est time in the school holidays , because with disabilities to be expected .
the traffic will be completed on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural Travel : cultural events for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre @-@ item &quot; The invisible House . &quot;
the Club N@@ ima &apos;s and the young theatre are now planning a music project .
the N@@ ima association provides young people with a migration and refugee grounds , cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited an idea of the award @-@ winning piece of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Young The@@ Theatre Mu@@ en@@ ster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the context of the N@@ ima &apos;s initiated cross @-@ cultural trip , 19 pupils between eleven and 15 years attended the st@@ aging in the little house .
since the beginning of the year , the association founded the cultural integration of young people with a mig@@ rat@@ ory and refugee grounds to visit schools with welcome groups , as part of this project cultural institutions in Münster .
most young people in the class were between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria have come to Münster , and a little German .
thanks to the chore@@ o@@ graphi@@ es , the s@@ cen@@ ical pictures and video animations it would have been possible to follow the conduct of action , so the press release of the Young The@@ Theatre Mu@@ en@@ ster .
the N@@ ima association , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wester@@ berg , and the young Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project .
from October to December , you@@ thful with and without fluid and migration background between 14 and 20 years will receive the opportunity to visit professional courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
special offers for children and families in the field of the@@ atri@@ cal and the@@ atri@@ cal language operating are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Tourism &quot; goes on .
given the A@@ sc@@ ended refugees , the association expects many classes that want to participate .
rain instead of ast@@ er@@ olls : hop@@ eless@@ ness
the weather has taken the star @-@ beak @-@ cast in the south @-@ west of Germany in the night to Friday a st@@ rich due to the bill - but there is still hope .

relaxing night : tips for bed@@ dysfunction
in the evening , one is going to be eternal , at night it is un@@ th@@ ink@@ able , in the morning there is far no longer think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep and more than ten per cent feel their sleep often or permanently as un@@ relaxing .
how do you express your sleep problems or bed@@ bugs ?
there are several forms of sleep , and there can be many different causes under@@ lie , Hans @-@ Günter We@@ der , CEO of the Deutschen Gesellschaft für Schlaf@@ forschung und Schlaf@@ medizin .
what one understands it , however , is the ins@@ om@@ nia , thus an input and sle@@ ep@@ y .
right now , many people seem to be uns@@ at@@ is@@ factory or inadequate , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , artist @-@ member of the German Haus@@ physician association with practice in the Lower @-@ American Var@@ el .
what is behind sle@@ e@@ dys@@ functions ?
the causes of sleep @-@ disorders are complex .
behind it , organic , psych@@ ic or behavi@@ oral factors , but also medicines are stuck .
not rarely is the sleep @-@ stor@@ ing expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early wake @-@ up is often seen with depression in particular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ aver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors combine to each other .
who for example has a sli@@ pped disk , can lie badly , w@@ acht every two to three hours and begins wom@@ an@@ ew to say about all day problems and -@@ to greet , gives them an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
starting when should you be with sle@@ e@@ eing to the doctor ?
who@@ ever does not sleep during a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is affected the day should go to the doctor , coun@@ cils We@@ ar .
the imp@@ air@@ ment may look quite different : one is down@@ cast , tired , un@@ exhausted , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood fluctu@@ ations or physical ail@@ ments like gast@@ ric or head@@ aches .
to alle@@ vi@@ ate the bed@@ time , it is important to find out their causes .
as a treatment options , among other things are alter@@ ations , a cogn@@ itive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or also medicines - classical sleeping @-@ tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ qu@@ ire .
precip@@ itation @-@ medic@@ s is hardly found in Germany , Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Club Centre of Char@@ ité Univers@@ ität@@ smedizin Berlin .
therefore , one should first rely on sleeping troub@@ les at first in the veter@@ inary surgeon .
this can clear up with studies whether the problems have a bodily cause .
who should be in sleep , and what happens there ?
for investigation in dormit@@ ory , medicine for example with snor@@ ing with respir@@ atory , disease @-@ fatigue , at disease step or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping troub@@ le@@ ction , explains Fi@@ etze .
it is actually not necessary to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not have a mid@@ day , &quot; says Fi@@ etze .
after the em@@ itting , one goes to his normal time into bed .
beside the electro@@ des on the body you can have a nose , a chest strap , and a spra@@ w@@ ler at the finger .
there is also a camera at the ceiling to the ceiling .
how can the affected have the problems get a handle ?
there are quite a lot of foot@@ prints where one can sleep for a better sleep .
white counts on : regular bed@@ - and departure times , not too long in bed can &apos;t sleep on the day not to sleep , stop smoking , and at night you do not look at the clock - then you start to immediately reck@@ on , and that is quite and not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming to has
the former German swi@@ mmer Mark Dei@@ bler is expressed by Facebook to dis@@ appointing the DS@@ V @-@ Team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he picked up gold at the short trail world championship in Doh@@ a for the first time and presented his first puppy games at the same time .
now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ l@@ ete Markus Dei@@ bler has left its us@@ efulness in the criticism of the ex @-@ team @-@ team @-@ mate .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic winner receives 20,000 € premium , and a jungle of 15@@ 0,000 € should not be surprised about missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on the night to Friday on his Facebook page .
the convey@@ or system in the swimming pool is bad , the D@@ op@@ ing@@ controls , however , very well .
in this way , we cannot compete with countries who do so much to promote and do not go exactly as closely with the subject of d@@ oping - or do it even operate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that controls are to be set up here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
it is exactly what you should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who cannot be controlled a certain time before the World Cup / OS by independent inspec@@ tions of the W@@ ada / fin@@ a may not take part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demands the choice of Hamburger , which has now run a ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of Por@@ osh@@ aphat was arrested
professional di@@ ebe at Düsseldorf Airport
on Thursday the occasion of the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police took the feast of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 .
the in@@ susp@@ ect had committed as a ban@@ de for a number of T@@ ash@@ - and Car@@ di@@ st@@ ling bars .
against 21 30 pm , civil official officials recognized in the area of the airport Düsseldorf a gang that was known to polic@@ emen from past theft .
the two women and two men had committed several Del@@ ik@@ te since the mid July of this year , and were involved in collabor@@ ative , collabor@@ ative and very professional .
the specialist of the crimin@@ als of 34 can subsequently re @-@ demonstrate the divisions , the ad@@ mitt@@ ance of criminal off@@ ences to Germany travelled to four acts of action .
at the same time , they had a total of more than 15,@@ 000 euros .
Alt@@ construc@@ tions , a few Lin@@ den@@ ers lined , meanwhile a rest of head@@ stones : the Rig@@ a@@ er Strasse in Berlin @-@ Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ hain affects the first sight not so , but the police counts it to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
walking along the road from the east to the west , one passes on playing places , a refres@@ hed kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
at the fa@@ ç@@ ade of a gray house , someone has &quot; ugly ! &quot;
opposite to a Li@@ dl , who is also to be demol@@ ished soon , it is already built : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new rentals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ en@@ ful district &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the official real estate company Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ hain is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the last weeks , however , preferred to be preferred with com@@ bust@@ ion cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile , the inhabitants of rental income , but on the ground floor are still premises occupied and are used for events .
especially the Berlin In@@ dic@@ ator H@@ enkel had repeatedly addressed the project &apos;s hard approach to the project since the beginning of the year , the area called &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonom@@ ous violence .
after 22 June the rooms were vac@@ ated on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ iede , with 300 police officer , pat@@ rou@@ ched the police three weeks of official statements , according to 30 to 40 officials and three Mann@@ schafts@@ wagen , standing parts of the road and kept visitors away from entering the house with number 94 .
local @-@ renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown land@@ owner the rooms .
on July 13 , a Berlin administration Court decided that the clear@@ ance was illegal , and a day later went to police and workers under the rejo@@ ic@@ ing of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street works peac@@ efully : parents are walking with children , people sitting on the side@@ walk before the houses in the sun , others are talking about sp@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the building projects , there are a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
le@@ ft@@ ist violence is not the main roads of many inhabitants : Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives since 1999 in the area , and Jana * which attracts three children especially by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the building projects , they share the concern of rising rental and v@@ entri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who wants to make up a multi@@ lateral pol@@ ze@@ able on the left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin In@@ sen@@ ator and the police have stopped between land@@ lords and their neighbors , does not seem to exist .
Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ hain in the east of Ber@@ lins was actually a traditional working @-@ class district , which also has a lower pace in comparison to the rest of the city .
land@@ owners and the native Croatian projects have been around for long since : 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including almost all the Main@@ zer street near the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer were laid under great police on a regular road @-@ hand corner , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ s and partly still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district of the past few years has increasingly become magn@@ ets for tourists and elec@@ ber@@ lin@@ ers from around the world : with them now residents of G@@ DR times and former land@@ owners share their area .
this also has noticeable over the renting , which have risen since 2009 with re @-@ hire for nearly 60 percent .
many of the newly built in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one recogni@@ zes them at that sli@@ ces or fresh fac@@ ades which were subjected to color .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other street was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonom@@ ous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : off@@ ences such as body injury are almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the off@@ ences make Sach@@ sen@@ ti@@ ments which make ten@@ den@@ cial more of the newly built and newly renovated houses .
for Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rental house for 17 years , next to the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
as far as violence is concerned , it is more important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours that certainly did not have been .
even the famous com@@ bust@@ ling cars give it right in the rig@@ a@@ er no longer .
for the studied architect , her street is not a crime of crimin@@ als , on the contrary . &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been consciously drawn into the rig@@ a@@ er street - and stayed .
that &apos;s why it was also so important that the inhabitants left its road : from the police , politics and the media , who in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the city .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : by virtu@@ ous new builds in former buildings that thr@@ ills the old inhabitants .
&quot; these are ultimately property flats , which are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so good , &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction can I be absolutely non @-@ healing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should we do if one never list@@ ens to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides of fru@@ stration , even with the police and the inhabitants .
for bar@@ racks , which spar@@ kles more color @-@ bom@@ bs , Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer got little understanding : the home projects and the left scene belonged to the area .
those who bring out should be aware - just like anyone who moves into a bar area to complain bad about noise .
all the names presented with first names were asked to not be called by their proper name
Ur@@ bach : Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee officer
Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organization .
in addition , it is social working on site .
since July , Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the refugee officer for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ y supports the team of managing Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees itself as a contact person for all players : refugees , Arbeitsk@@ reis Refu@@ ge@@ dorf , Administration , Author@@ ities and who else will be mist@@ aken .
Reg@@ ine customer of the Arbeitsk@@ reis indicates that the volunteer is more than grateful that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is now that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is there , the ei@@ er@@ legen@@ de Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au , which has mainly a problem .
so some - less fun as rather on the multitude of desirable tasks are purpos@@ eful - meant when the administration was to write the place .
sought was a administration of administration with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long @-@ term experience in the field of social work , just a viable Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au .
however , administrative work is not their central area , but means Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
most of all it is about organization , work with local people and also behind the scenes , as well as network quality .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for approximately six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent place on three years in the long term .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Catherine D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le ehr@@ ad@@ - and full @-@ time actors support .
there are large and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems .
soon new containers in the wash @-@ road
a serious problem has been recognized for some time , apartments for the cover loop that have been acknowledged .
for the application provision , the municipalities are responsible .
you must put the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the cost of building , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities .
the responsibility varies from the municipal office to Kommun@@ e and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
for some time the search has been very difficult for some time .
de facto the management does not find private apartments .
however , it does not function so far as you rely on private apartments , so D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , the community resi@@ dences have to be visited as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers are put up in the Was@@ p road .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keywords , Reg@@ ine customer and Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a fixed bond , there are tra@@ ine@@ eshi@@ ps , training places , training courts , one @-@ Euro jobs and benefits for refugees and migrants who have to be bol@@ ted or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine Customer .
many work in the building yard or help home @-@ performance , do charitable work - and this motiv@@ ates and very neat , like Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work is leading to a positive outlook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
working does not mean only work .
the day needs a solid structure , say D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
the people would have to develop an associated feeling .
so there are offers like sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so there can also be administration and volunteers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they were welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the procedures is a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they need to explain the refugees that it just takes and it can make it useful for example , for example with language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who will eventually develop the feeling that he could not help with Ur@@ bach , should not work and be useless , that will never integrate itself .
the distinct majority was motivated .
problem cases , however , also says customer honestly , &quot; people in which nothing goes . &quot; the work of D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
all this is a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : did the two are afraid of the recent occur@@ ence of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer can be very clear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what man@@ cher would like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to call it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a balance would like it and if they want to ex@@ clude them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sen@@ sit@@ ised is the hel@@ per already .
these alleg@@ ations are also subject to the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people would have the fear that the attacks bring them completely in re@@ vocation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with them , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main - and volunteers must keep on site and stand out in the region according to activities .
they always have in the background that a new shock in refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a limit ?
to answer this question clearly , do not shy politics .
actually , it is unfair to put them on the spot .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we are still not there where we want , &quot; says Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , this would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ bacher have already subs@@ cribed to the existing people to be integrated .
these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
however , if people are in need to help them both women are united .
the political situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ars with helic@@ opter wanted
