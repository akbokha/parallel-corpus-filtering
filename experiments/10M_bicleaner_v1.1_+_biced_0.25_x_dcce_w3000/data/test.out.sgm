<seg id="11">That is why the taxes would increase to the rich, she says.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended up a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">Leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to release his hands and proclaim an official end for the eight months of long-lasting war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But as Vladimir Putin his Turkish counterplayer in the gilded room of St. Petersburg Palastes in reception, I cannot desperate to the imprint, that Ankara wants to love this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile unallied and he felt very little warmth, even for its cautious relationships.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan on the other hand spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report full of five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old levels before the crisis, but to improve themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day described a newspaper that Erdogan had heard that as if it had never been worse.</seg>
<seg id="11">My enthusiasm seemed to interpret rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin-radiant, sustainable perfection showed that the State of Russia had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first, what he mentioned in its introductory period: the downing of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border with Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was wasted.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara, Russia to be fallen into the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The failure was even bigger, as it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The veto restore will be difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">Months Lang, the nationally controlled media conducted a severe, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once it seemed like the Turks for everything to blame.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the most serious, the accusations of the officials that Erdogan's own family benefited from illicit oil trading in areas of Syria, which controlled by the so-called Islamist state.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has disputed this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin from the President Erdogan received the accusation he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could make a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the advantages of a ceasefire clear on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs first and foremost all friends that he can get after last month with a failed coup d coup d was beaten in almost his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey also have shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia travel operators and charter companies will be facilitated when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">You count on a delay of the rush of the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week projected the state-off cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports will be restored once more.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry on the West as it was the reaction to the tried to take power of power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">To this end, the persistent Groll come across the snail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the extendent to move out of cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian leader won in Ankara with security a bonus that he sought after the prosecute support for the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well-evident for Moscow, that itself has a profound fear of regimeism.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious palace at the seaside allowed the Russia and Turkey as it was a analysts once described, "alliance of an outsider": two countries who come across from the West and would now feel badly addressed.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, in spite of public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two ones.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support them.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be signifying that after almost three hours on initial talk, both Presidents were told on the press conference, that they didn't even comprehend the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey failed to respond to a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on what a common denominator can be found towards Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect dispaster, when NATO's member is collapsing the Russian fighter - it is certainly better that the two leaders have at least talking to one another.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Russian President Vladimir Putin has released his Stabilizer Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was many years part of the narrowest confidence source of Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old became appointed for the special officers for environmental and transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin, it is that Putin without stating reasons" "" "dismissal Ivanovs arranged by his duties as Chairman of the Russian presidential Administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanovs since 2012 was appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">1972 in the Estonian capital city of Tallinn, he made his graduated at the renowned State Department of Moscow International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is (in Russian), that he later was a log and boss of the government leader.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "about his appointment he said to Putin," "" "thank you for your trust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a state of state, and checks controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV Channel on Friday with that Ivanov asked to leave his post and advised Vaino as its successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convincing the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest confidence Vladimir Putin and works like it for the Soviet intelligence, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As the Stef, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men said that the Stef refrails down on his own wish.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the surface for cameras, here are only a few of them convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the consequence of a kind of power-match?</seg>
<seg id="20">This is currently no one.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who was once challenged as a potential president, to once of the Russian environmental policy - came across great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, who are quoted on the website of the Kremlin, Ivanov "it is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - to trust four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been the chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was deputy prime minister and Defense.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the European Security Council.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, as Putin president of the Bundessicherhästes (FSB) was appointed to the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">As Putin brought to power he called Ivanov as one of five people, whom he became the most familiar.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once believed, Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term president, as a third presidential term has been postponed against the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, Seated allies Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the link between the viaduct and the Brückendeck is a sensitive activity that will require extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">Altogether, nearly 79% of the total loopies are at their place and the last part of Decks is today in Rosyth an actuation for the deck, which means the entire Deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to his place.</seg>

<seg id="4">The SPD is proposing to next Ratssession a "towel concept" in front of.</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it is about the question: who is supposed to build the favorable apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>

<seg id="9">However, the affordable housing prices can also be found in its continuance.</seg>

<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to be at least 10 percent in such areas, but as 20 percent of apartments as a social housing." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the professionals.</seg>
<seg id="20">But still the program is not completely: because the approximately 1260 new apartments should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how does one compare the loss of other about 1300 cheap apartments, which is going to run over the next few years?</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teens and child are no longer going to go outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time, to rigid on screens, has been shifted over the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go it's about to get people out of the sofa and be more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that was created on the characters that first created for Videospiele in the 1990s (later emerged from a character series, game cards and other spin-off).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many phenomena of the Popular Front, interest in the publication of the game is recorded in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was moved by massive demand that overloaded the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players agree with their smartphone and look for Pokémons, who are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found, "photographed" (over a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the search from the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, the game introduced a considerable rise in steps which removes the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an App for Apple Watch, the 35.000 users announced, the Washington Post recently concluded that within two days of launch of the game, the number of successive people followed each day 30 minutes by train, by 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who does the Pokémon Go - it only looks the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns to health, people want to take" "" "take 30 minutes time" "", "" "" "getting to be active every day, because many public messages are more boring and to come by people who look like." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport can not be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly drives sport reduces its odds, to become cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps with the weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful at Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people are even closing new friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are mabometric players who always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should 's?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has made a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even though smartphone apps like FitBit could follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to drift sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Due to poker success, however, there will be more games to be able to unite the apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world, thereby being able to help many people on the hunt, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine in the role of women in the gymnastics and that is more than a reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been playing with every summer Olympics in 1984 and the United States were never so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second, this team has three turers, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren, Laurie "Hernandez, who was inspiring for many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this crew, the Aly Raisman, the Jüdin and Madison Cocian, the catholikin is, round off, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally mirrors the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has paved the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one was one among the female turrets a Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year were Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympiagewinnin and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to be able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world championship in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as she was unexpected, but masterful Gymastic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American she won in an individual multi-election event for women Gold.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are witnessing the top of this sport, but that kind of gym all over the country do not look out.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie schlugen all the same way as Aly and Madison, to bring it to the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "last Five" "", "because the next Olympics are only four turers in the team." "" "furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is so that Turns is a more expensive sport and gymnasts are primarily maintained in private trainers who will be maintained by parents, which are open for training, free clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families). the list can be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these trainers are in affluent suburbs to support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts receive their whole training and that is a good and long-term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainee of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainee of Laurie Hernandez, both had trained their athletes, since they started with the turbine.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to be inspired by the congregations of countless, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a powerful and easy accessible exercise.</seg>
<seg id="23">I was founded my Turnstiftung of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events we have offered free and affordable turkey in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth (above all black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we are expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turkey develops strength, flexibility, and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and certainty for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this crew, which bringing the thousands of young girls to be interested in the turbine and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is a so exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this genuine presentation of "Girl Power" through the Holes of the Olympic team and thanks, Fass will motivate her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to get healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller subtled his immune system and sausage in a serious investigation - by stained some of the most contamination and ecelarest places of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel agent Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk pictured his course on a Euro-Schein, a Geländer at Piccadilly Circus, a dishwasher of a train toilette, as well as a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resiliency of its immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of the crow of each object, he used a Luminometer to prove and show us what he will have.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment that was filtered under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" brought some startling results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought, dismiss the dishwasher of a train toilet, that has already been used by thousands of others, may be totally detached, but actually located in a kitchen rinse more bad bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with physicians and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria, as well as his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Luckily nothing left nothing, which he leak, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his intestines by traveled by the world and ate peculiar and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to stations to sink to sink of toilets, the task assigned its immune system definitely among a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told us: "already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I put all kinds of things in my mouth, earth, worms, and bat water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was just addressing his reputation in any case.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing that he shaded was a dirt public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its probeel showed a Luminometer value of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to that the Luminometric count is fresh from less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to leaning off, after their Luminometric count was over 4000 units, while fresh hands excels one of less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products valio produced the Reisefilm "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacteria from different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says," "" "this comes to the worst, which I have dashed in a restroom." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will do nothing here because it is ininside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company is offered by Wright with Valio Gefilus that contains both lactobacillus and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and New categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer the consumer something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that's fascinating to look for and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We led crazy Brainstormings by saying that we told "Make us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of the gut health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, which led the direction of the film, said: "let me tell me so - I would have awakened my respect for Ian when he had taught me, such as the ekelty Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things where it was simpler, Ian to bring it to leaks and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I am glad that we have made some of these dirty treats on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In one of Valio conducted survey conducted by 2015, 84 percent of all surveyed lactic acid bacteria, in particular with the well being of gastroman and Darm and 58 percent said that they at least use products that included lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who is actually baptized plates?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged men love records.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you go to the commentary rope to sow it under the pseudonym of non-allergy sufferers with rust insults, this statement derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the multiplied redevelopment of sound plates is not attributable to a boom in millennials that would like to welcome the re-life of physical objects, but to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a record are of all predictions after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older flatmates retain their feelings more likely to spend (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog is a news report on television, I would follow the camera, while in the middle of a busy road in Soho run, a modest gray anage trage and wild dusty, before I steal, my hands get hold and a bit of determinant like: so, let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of Sohos is slowly coming to his charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - are still a handful of fantastic turntable stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera to the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I followed by Sister Ray (Data qty: two young women, three men middle age) into the Reckless Records (eight men middle age, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and passes through the shops to fill in the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, ask me?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets.</seg>
<seg id="17">This transducer, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I'm not followed home), dress the walls of his sitting room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records which he could not afford as they appeared and re-buy items that he sold, when he was young and pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I Buy, are out of the late sixties, early 70ans, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things where I probably was something too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is true that those who are buying plates, rather introverted and would like to spend their own time, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my loaster.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, believes that many customers that he meets to the YouGov's profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who have been affected by the Mediape, people who have heard about comeback and prompted to buy their old plates again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations that I have led, people usually reported as around 1998 or 1999 of their collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers that once bought their records to buy CDs and now sell their CDs to buy their records. "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom of tags of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a shop such as Phonica to recognize that record stores a soothing community of inminded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to the WEZ, some of the older customers were incurred by the outless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record-fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of confidential silverers, of objects, the blissful youth-minded guilt.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possessions of material possessions than a kind of consolation."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is my collectors, so I think it is so many people so.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like her social worker!" "" "flavoring an employee of a record stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people have bought a record, they have not yet listened.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found out that 41% possess a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the message, I would probably look very concerned while I dazzled through a stack to Bossa Nova Kompilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of men: three men aged-aged) has noticed a "trophy" of the Revivals.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone came just recently here and said," "" "I have no record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead sound, so that I can put them into the shelf," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a great percentage, but it is definitely going to happen.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-duty, less musicig.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say:" "" "I have no record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older who come only slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has devoted to the sound Plates nearly a whole floor, has a lively audience than I rew.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and women middle aged men.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops is - Wild Beasts neuter synthesired and sexbepackaged pop instead of experimental, penetrated from the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks scarlet, but nagging psychic traumata are hard to define when you stand beside someone 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been around in business for a few minutes and looks at the variation for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It makes more a display ortality than a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not deserve much, so the collecting of boards is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to hear music from a computer or another way, but the beauty of plates is... "it drives with a likeable epidemzer.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it is really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business, which is said that a new generation of record-owners should have inspired: urban outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I'm giving the sunshine, the jeans-hotpants, I observe a group of young teenager, who had for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are wondering to buy a crosley turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a stairwell, a wall full of panels of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees it itself - maybe because they are only purely ornamental, some so far above that it's impossible to grasp them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research inquiries made that the results of YouGov vote, let them at least in record stores in Soho, the great number of female collectors and discos who exist in reality, discos and in Onlinelayen.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning certainly not with the stroll through discos of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while watching the starring view of an uncanny, 30-year old misator of which over the shoulders nothing else raging middle aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at 7-er Rugby came to a abrupt halt during the last hurdle in the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were struck with a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro stage here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji divided a masterclass in handling, side-stepping, post-race and rower power to win Gold - her first Olympiamedaille of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was failed because of the non-poor performance of the silver medal - the Great Britain on this day - and they could quite be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they proposed New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The distinct defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could be returned to them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But independently of it fiji could have done a 15-man-team in stock-form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It might be a Trost for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis Editor Ben Ryan, the former Chief of the England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">He had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago they lost in Ryan of each game with Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This map will be wading, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began marvelous and made the attacks GBs of fun demons.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. in, when you're running in driving buses. the World Series winners were 5-0 upward, as Osea Kolinisau in the corner rrushed at the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With just four minutes of game, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner which he converts.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely broke the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hepraging valley of Mitchell stops the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it has only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua in the right corner a touchdown round and there stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new beginning since the re-finish and there was still over a minute of games... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou prefeited by further weak tacklings of the GB of teams and rushed up to line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The transformation brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while he was still uncovered.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">He introduced fundamental changes to half-time and closed the fijian gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Josua Tuisova had gone after a brilliant stopplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game ran for long in favour of the Südseeinsulan, whose fans sangen, flags and dances on the bleachers.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not hard to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame set the cake basks with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle chönte, the fijis umhuts themselves and GB kicked crushing in the lawn.</seg>

<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footprint and achieved a gate among the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling from Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-aside teams, securing the profit - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the trainer</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no palerting gold than in these games and that wants what is hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke until the last, 220 hard troieve, who enter into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional importance in their golden moment at the Estacio since Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if it were only the Beige those who sat at the king, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams, was more present when they rusted the second Olympiagold in a row without tax lady, the first women in the history of the British Sports who laid out a standard.</seg>
<seg id="5">Your dominance was absolutely, after all you have more than more advanced use, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletes, who through the surface planted with the elegance of sponges, which does not reflect the type of triumphal point.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in the ruin there is a battalion that contribute to the incremental progress to make the difference and it was nobody assistant than the coach who would not survive at all times when he was diagnosed this day when cancer was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, the operable and this did they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty sclimous situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he may start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, was able to start what the break up to a minimum in case that in such circumstances is the correct term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go back soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it another bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the inmediability of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve wrapped mornings that spent something more than usual and tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Panning, which was considered captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, "I was this week an emotional wreck. this is perhaps something extremely, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeats how much I mean how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would be no one, therefore a massive thank him. he is the best coach of the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I could not have a better person for coach or better trainers.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have no race lost over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents were not able to keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark have started expended, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very caught at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "Stempt in the process, abide in the process."</seg>

<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp already accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in teacher-study she recorded the barrel music, and today the 78-year-old he sings in a senior choir.</seg>

<seg id="6">For singing is equal from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler of the German seniors.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors singers in chorus and share with like-minded the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular connections, seniors can make social contacts and cultivate.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because frequently, social and family structures emerge at the age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "speak and organize themselves to be able to rely on the others - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="13">Whoever calls his lungs regularly, even in everyday life not so quickly from the puste.</seg>

<seg id="15">On Elderly, singing often has a very special effect, Ursula Lenz says from the federal work community of the senior organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the common chair had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and leisure, explains them.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or hearing of songs in elderly people awakens many memories, often linked to positive emotions of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">By lyrics and especially melodies wares themselves denote people in long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">When singing, the head does not require special performance, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time concentrate on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just older people who live alone, practice not only on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the acknowledgment that one drives through the singing in the choir, thinks Hackler.</seg>

<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem grows by the singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: if I am long for something, I will get better and vigorous about me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start with the singing, so there is enough.</seg>

<seg id="28">You don't sings alone - with 50 singing people who listen to it, when a sound goes on it?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the right offer, seniors various ways, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sings someone from the familiar circle in a senior choir, you can just connect.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many towns also offer views over the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in an ecclesiasting choir can turn directly to the church or the Fathers.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many sentichors can also be found via the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who do not have access to the internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors to help with the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="4">The Central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>

<seg id="6">"what has happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers have to be presented if bad analyses of our political leaders will be presented," Ken Calvert, Republican Member of the House of Representatives, firm.</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership in the CentCom reach up to the top leader in the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-round report presents detailed meetings in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the education of the Iraqi Armed Forces.</seg>

<seg id="10">"during the first semi-year 2015, many Central Command press releases, comments and statements in the Congress were significantly more positive than it matches the facts."</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom has publicly known that a military reconquest of Moselle could already start in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mossul, the second-largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>

<seg id="15">The republicans called the Task Force to Life, after it was agreed that analysts got worried about the Manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday is further completed by more detailed findings throughout the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="17">Additional investigations of CentCom reports are ongoing through the United Nations Secretary of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the news account published on Thursday published their own findings, which matches some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015 the CentCom generated a unrestricted process for the creation of news channels to ISIL and the Iraqi security services, gave the highest standards in the Kommittee, Member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Ship, in an opinion.</seg>

<seg id="23">Last August the New York Times reported by investigators on the Pentagon, which were recorded by CentCom analyst.</seg>
<seg id="24">L. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press spokesman of the Pentagon, gave in an opinion that the Secretary of Defence would have no reports of Congress, while the investigation of the general spector was still going on.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also assumed that" "" "experts sometimes have no diverging opinions about the interpretation of complex data and that the intelligence services and Defence ministers welcomed a controversy discussion on these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have acted beyond the question of a successful aerial campaign on American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion which is now done by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations of last year have raised the question that President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State remind ilities of more than ten years ago, as a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, looking forward to the recommendations of many analyst only a small credence of Iraq in Iraq and had little time on it to make thinking about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the revolt against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker, according to government officials, that contrary to the statements of the Government strikes, no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as this provisional refining would have been put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this knowledge was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damal instruction, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature due to its overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin went into the retirement in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after they shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American Feldhockeyteam of women in a match on Thursday to India, that the Americans seers with 3-0 acuity.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said, she could not remember the ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not belonging to people who keep their goals in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, they know: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are still in their group with the Britain on the first place, which remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will succumb their first round on Saturday in the last game.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of both within their group from six teams will win the first and second place.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first-place will last the strong Dutchine somewhat longer out of the way that will lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game may go on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex by their success story, four years after they landed in the last London games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey bat in hands (her two older sisters gave the Sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became a national game of the USA, the most recent one in the history of the team.</seg>

<seg id="17">We did not have the working trip to London, which we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We will be able to pluck the ruin completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday nights Bam opened the torches in the first half of the game with a backhand out of the closet.</seg>
<seg id="20">India was gone without victory in the tournament, but the team showed himself surprisingly strong and held the player from 1-0 to the third quarter, until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">They took a Sprint with the flat ball through the left side flank, then moved into the middle and invited the ball into the gate for the Americans to get a 2-0 guide.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last four district.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the middle of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel inconsistent and inwardly, a lightning season between competition and striving.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the olympic fackel itself would be a combustible stab, which is protected from the wristband to the swimming pool to the Triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can not turn the television, read a newspaper or listen when talking to your neighbours in queue in the coffee shop without about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman black with barbecue, could indeed have been sent among these well-known names which would be sent to Prime Time designed by sponsors and well-being TV commercials if he would be a swimmers, gymnasts, or even real estate.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fighting in the Olympic Trampoline for gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame does not illuminates every event alike.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade, are the sports that are not generally recognized: air pistol shoot, archery, Badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and may it last for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I might think humble arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline has already been a Olympic event since 2000, when it had been in Sydney there was the last 16 years so sparsely noticed that many things, I had asked, did not know that it is an Olympiasportart.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the US sent Athleten for competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline and had a athlete to the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to feed the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline resight a certain outsider, partly because it sounds for the unresolved ear-fit for a clowns preschool than that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an unpackaged enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous trembling - the kartoonous trembling of his never ending quitting - but also the Grazie of the gyms and pigeon, the two sports that combines it essentially.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "Trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as the springboard.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rising winner jumping on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements (rotating, genuine and saltos) before they land on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are assessed according to official Olympic-m according to the execution, difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women to compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic Vektor is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallied hoped must continue in their quest for gold, faster, upwards and over, sometimes till the goal, sometimes back and back, upwards and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They are not only the Ziellinie or the curwall, but in the television recording also another cave objective: the world or the Olympiarekords.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purposeful pursuit is nobles, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even stir a audience to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I find even while watching this games as a bit tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">Of which the trampoline offers a reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the tramp-jumper is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward-moving movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she prallude from, seemingly heavier than an astronaut, goes up, then down, then after below, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course, not without difficulty but during exercise there is no hectonic attack on the goal, no waking in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant abolition of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and endings of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; those of the men on Saturday, also about 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will shine the ends as part of a afternoon-blocks on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia Manie, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked at the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the consciousness levels can only be achieved through the anxiety and the lens of masculine athletes - as there is the male U.S. turner according to The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Dooley awaits its after air rinks, new fanes.</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protest in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators, the political changes in Ethiopia are calling for violent resistance from the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that zig demonstrators were killed during the clashes with the police on Schorussia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just to come together?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid composing of the West with a fast growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months, protests against the government shaken the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week turbulent thousands of people on the streets and slowed fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the response of the government was immerciful.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses took note that policemen were shot on zig unarmed protesters and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Moving across the protests regarding the protests, presumably from the last or beginning of this year, such as vulnerabilities are young people with shocks, while they were forced to make a hand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The chief of the UN Food Safety Agency for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this land together and will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa from the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is after Nigeria the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopia in order to fight counter terrorism across the region, particularly in Somalia. just a few countries in Africa, if at all, obtain such a lot of Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian Economy is expanded at the considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has advanced dramatically - there is a new pendulum in the capital of Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have consistently led the suppression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited, whereas the presidents have become effective.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were killed in exile or in prison, or were driven into the wilderness of the wilderness.</seg>
<seg id="21">But this could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you press people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks off," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in the central town of Ethiopians." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth were protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation was protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous discomforts that cover everything from the soil usage to the stranglehold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a further criticised election of last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the Opposition, and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this pronged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst fear that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden have been imposed in recent years more or less, the turmoil benefit and rearms themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of crunch under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smart phones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years a lot of Ethiopians have been able to communicate with social media, since cheap smartphones were becoming more common and improved the Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government unlock the access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, above all in protests, do many people still communicate about internet-proxies, conceal where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians had passed that they gathered together on protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity among the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons the Amharas, who originate from Äthopia, predominantly of Christian highlands, in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and within lowland-areas live.</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing just.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are thereby to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests found in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is ceasefly dominating from members of the ethnic group of the Tigray that are currently dominating around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military, in commerce and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was up to his death on a non-terrestrial disease of the year 2012 17 years of Ethiopian prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as tactical genius, a man who could think around the corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was especially sealed at this, early indication of dissatisfaction and use special instructors to edit opponents and make them inharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime is lacking in this fundamental skill," "" "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict-analytical." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen relatively unguarded reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopian, Mr. Hailemariam came from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts are saying that he does not have the confidence of the security services provided by the Tigray controlled safety services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia was going to protest such a rebellion in 2005, after thousands against elections were protested, according to data from analyst, seemingly were apparently curated and stolen by the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following sweeps were killed many protesters, although there were less than in recent months and this time of unrest went relatively fast.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, like the new commeller, as well as their measurable progress in poverty reduction." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal missification of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month of the protest in gondar, a amorous city, by Tigray-guided shops and the pass compared to the Tigray in the social media is more and more commonly practiced.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that protests the U.S. and other Western allies come to a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even though they have recently stated that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want its allies in a already volatile area collapsing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump declared his assertion against Obama was founded "Sarkasmus," Sarkasmus. "</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dissipate the last controversy on Friday holding his campaign, by attacking his multiple repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder" of the Islamic State, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarifies new questions concerning the communication skills of the Presidents republicans, whether he is able to communicate clear and comprehensible to the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his comrades to take an effort into protecting him during an uneventful period, to explain in the peculiar position, statements that he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After having made the announcement of an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump was back with regard to the claim on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intended to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in a morning tweet he said on Friday Mr. Trump, he was simply sarcastically.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the allegation completely seriously.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hivt, Mr. Trump wanted to weaken the statement something to weaken the statement that Mr. Obama wants to destroy it, the Republican candidate, wanted nothing to know of it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of the criticism prasselt on Mr. Trump while he is trying to steer the focus of his campaign on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches for the economic situation in Michigan in this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried again to return to this issue.</seg>
<seg id="12">By using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton could lead to higher taxes and that he found his speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has taken Sarkasmus to its defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">In late July he passed strong criticism on himself, when he said the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton Emails, but he explained later "of course I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the boundaries in politics and then return home to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "I think it's one of its methods to test how certain messages came from his fans, how they arrive, and if necessary" "" "depending on how the reaction falls." "" "said Ruth Tyler, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in several ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of sharpening the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has accepted an even engraved tone since his polls have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, who was released on Friday, showed a tour with a big jump into the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is in general tries to apologize for his provocative expressions, he often accused his critics to distorate his statements or to understand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is strengthening the attention of attention in recent months of its presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought its loyal involvement into the inconvenient situation to stand independently of how provocative may also be his statements.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of the most famous interrogators, had great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I think what he says is legitimate, political comments" "" "said Mr. Giuliani he asked about the correctness of Mr. Trumps, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had already established the Islamic State." ""</seg>

<seg id="25">Most of the mainstream Republicans attempt to argue that the government served under Obama, in the Mrs. Clinton as an Outer minister, it allowed ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönland, Greenland is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenlandhaie usually come only in winter to surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This Hai was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the Catschiffs Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic Ocean - to the present day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenlandhaie will only get over 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Above floating the Greenland-shark along the ground of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on an average just 1,220 feet far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it arrives, accelerates the five meters long animal on satte 2,6 km / h - and is half as fast as an seals.</seg>
<seg id="9">This of loneliness flourished lifestyles seems to be a panacea for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal "Science" at any rate from Greenlandhai, which could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Scherrlein from Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock to this life-span that means for vertebrates a world record.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionists thought long that Greenlandhaie are rock-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only failed the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenlandhaie are hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea from the skinny coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually dive on the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">About the lifestyle of the Greenlandus know researchers according to little.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their time pentine bleak them, when they shank six animals with a transmitter in front of the Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Loot still make this sharks: in the stomach of a animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, a different one had swallowed the jaw of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they sleep sleepy animals or patrol on the basis of the ice age and look for Kadets, which from higher water layers to lower below.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenlandhaie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as to catch the depth of the North Atlantic Ocean.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest hai was only 81 centimeters long, while the largest is 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of animals, they analysed with the carbon-14-method the linens of the sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eyelid is already born before the birth of the sharks, which in it the proteins are later not renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had remarkable lots of carbon-14 in the linens.</seg>
<seg id="25">Her birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear waffentries larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In which 220 centimeters long the smallest animal contained the linens from contrast to a small excess of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenlandhaie had in their linens against normal carbon-14 volumes that arises from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 centimetres long Greenlandhai, an age of 335 years, whereas the record-shark could be even 392 years old with 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenlandhai females become only then descended, when they are longer than four meters were known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now, the researchers of the length could be assigned to old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters are probably at the threshold of the sex ripe and his age was determined with 156 years, Greenlandhaie can be obviously at least one and a half centuries time.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even this is likely to be Weltrekord for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record-holder, a 211 year old Greenlandwal, put up in his bacon at the neck a 120 year old Harpunish lace, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures it often runs the organism that live there on asflams.</seg>
<seg id="36">So, they mature and slower slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm up in cold water, the animals are often too large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface, by which the animal sheds stands out.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much greater than in one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives in dangerous and should focus on getting as many descendants as soon as possible," "" "explains the evolutionist biologist" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="42">On the contrary, a very big animal should be investing more into a long life on the other hand.</seg>

<seg id="2">Venus was probably habitable for the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms that resemble climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine if Venus could have been associated with their hot, waterproof surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow lutes of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation points out that Venus could have had a thin, invaded atmosphere and still slow down.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model illuminates the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet is presumably more dry areas than de earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and spread it even more rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus profited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS modelling simulation exponates the slow change of Venus her dayessside of the Sun almost two months," explained GISS scientists Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick slider clouds, which acts like an umbrella, to shield the surface of a large part of the solar heating.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures, which are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that was previously thought of Planetary researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although she was probably been inhabitable, the Venus is exposed to many heat and ultra-violet light in the course of several billion years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans stems and its watervapor was burned out of the ultraviolet light.</seg>

<seg id="6">The Chinese Swimwear in Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter freight in Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weights for Adrian Destinski were tested in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the already critical prevalent Athletics competitions are coming these messages to the unknown.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen last Sunday, the diuretics was detected by hydrochlorothiazide, which is used as a masculine agent for dopters.</seg>

<seg id="13">For the first time in history it is not the IOC, but the CAS for the rehabilitation of athletes with positive cases.</seg>

<seg id="17">According to the report, it is said to be the most forbidden substance around the blood-dopamine EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekowa has been provisional prooed, according to BNT, the B-sample is supposed to be a positive one.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgaria's prime minister Boikko Borissow was immediately directed with criticism of the Athalizer.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data klau: so perfide erpressen hacker her solransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of compressing malware currently rely on targeted companies - and are successful in this process.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey conducted by Malware-Abwehr specialists Malwarebytes amongst 540 companies in North America, the United Kingdom and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies have at least once, partially several victims of a tactacke with Erpresser software.</seg>
<seg id="4">Almost 20 percent of companies have already reached the target of a Ransomware compressmaking.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of victims paid a willingly prepared by the perpetrators to use the systems and data in order to be able to use the requested systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their Represser software according to the observations of Malwarebytes in attack on the attacks in the company's networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">Are they successful there, the potentially explosive ransom is significantly higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a startling fast evolution of harm software," "" "explains Malwarebytes manager Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most Malwarefunds were still recommended to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then discovered the offenders Erpress.Software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">First, private users were the target, but the change to company attacking took place in the past months scary quickly.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware operates after a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim is active, she is searching for unlong altered files like Word-, Excel- or database files as well as on archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypted the Ransomware and deletes the originals lasting.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently the software presents the demands of pressing.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final code code into the files, the victims need money - usually in the form of the cryptoon Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">Yet, where in private users, the personal photo database is at stake, it concerns companies around sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage falls off when a ransomware suggests.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German firms in their sales were reported by Ransomware, 13 per cent even the business operations had to be completely disrupt, in case of one case people were in life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany already several hospitals were victims of attack, whose patients may be threatened by the loss of health acts.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims:" "" "pays not, you only encourages the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the operation of breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build everything in order to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study the security researcher from F-Secure manages the user-surfaces and contact with the pressurers and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually attempting to establish a kind of customer service to adopt more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">You will explain to their victims via chat, as they may pay by Bitcoin, direct access websites or decode otherwise example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And private people are redeemed by payments of a few hundred million Euros, companies have to negotiate some hard and five-digit sums pay to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively lower profits from the Ransomware compressmaking, the hacker gets more professional and share the work, explains Security experts Chester Wisniewski from the Antivirus provider of Sophos: "a single person can write a Ransomware around within one week."</seg>
<seg id="28">More likely, it is that it is about three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmer sell their damage software in the form of a software design to the actual blackmailers.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous Malware kits were created by the malware, consulting and additional tools for a unique, solid price between 1,000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is a adaptation tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The prescriers then search for further hacker to spread the freshly sold software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one is logged in one of the forums in the underground, buys the set of a crime and asked another to install the software on the many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per insulated calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals then bear with the spread" "", "explains Ouniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">By now, the risk of Ransomware is known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies in the Malwarebytes survey have to rely on Ransomware using file-back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful treatment, threaten the perpetrators instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer list or pricing," "", "explains Malwarebytes manager Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">For this, the potential for damages depending on the type of data is still a lot higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators of the future could take completely new goals in the internet of things on the grain.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the HackerConference Defcon demonstrated safety scientists, as they could get a thermostat with the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter the friction of a so-block heating of heating were certainly worth a ransom worth.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the offenders then instead of the heating in the future block a whole production street in a factory, Ransomware might also be subject to an issue in the industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, one is going to be eternal, at night it is unthinkable, in the morning there is far no longer think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep and more than ten per cent feel their sleep often or permanently as unrelaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do you express your sleep problems or bedbugs?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep, and there can be many different causes underlie, Hans-Günter Weder, CEO of the Deutschen Gesellschaft für Schlafforschung und Schlafmedizin.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands it, however, is the insomnia, thus an input and sleepy.</seg>
<seg id="8">Right now, many people seem to be unsatisfactory or inadequate, Jens Wagenknecht, artist-member of the German Hausphysician association with practice in the Lower-American Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleedysfunctions?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep-disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it, organic, psychic or behavioral factors, but also medicines are stuck.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the sleep-storing expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early wake-up is often seen with depression in particular," "" "says Weaver." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors combine to each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who for example has a slipped disk, can lie badly, wacht every two to three hours and begins womanew to say about all day problems and -to greet, gives them an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">Starting when should you be with sleeeing to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Whoever does not sleep during a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is affected the day should go to the doctor, councils Wear.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may look quite different: one is downcast, tired, unexhausted, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood fluctuations or physical ailments like gastric or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate the bedtime, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a treatment options, among other things are alterations, a cognitive behavioural therapy or also medicines - classical sleeping-tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquire.</seg>
<seg id="22">Precipitation-medics is hardly found in Germany, Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Club Centre of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, one should first rely on sleeping troubles at first in the veterinary surgeon.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can clear up with studies whether the problems have a bodily cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should be in sleep, and what happens there?</seg>
<seg id="26">For investigation in dormitory, medicine for example with snoring with respiratory, disease-fatigue, at disease step or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping troublection, explains Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is actually not necessary to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not have a midday," says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the emitting, one goes to his normal time into bed.</seg>
<seg id="31">Beside the electrodes on the body you can have a nose, a chest strap, and a sprawler at the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">There is also a camera at the ceiling to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can the affected have the problems get a handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of footprints where one can sleep for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">White counts on: regular bed- and departure times, not too long in bed can't sleep on the day not to sleep, stop smoking, and at night you do not look at the clock - then you start to immediately reckon, and that is quite and not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="1">Altconstructions, a few Lindeners lined, meanwhile a rest of headstones: the Rigaer Strasse in Berlin-Friedrichshain affects the first sight not so, but the police counts it to the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">Walking along the road from the east to the west, one passes on playing places, a refreshed kindergarten and a biolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the façade of a gray house, someone has "ugly!"</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite to a Lidl, who is also to be demolished soon, it is already built: until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new rentals.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "article about this" "" "trenful district" "", "as the official real estate company Friedrichshain is called" "" "for the last weeks, however, preferred to be preferred with combustion cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile, the inhabitants of rental income, but on the ground floor are still premises occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Especially the Berlin Indicator Henkel had repeatedly addressed the project's hard approach to the project since the beginning of the year, the area called "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After 22 June the rooms were vacated on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officer, patrouched the police three weeks of official statements, according to 30 to 40 officials and three Mannschaftswagen, standing parts of the road and kept visitors away from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Local-renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown landowner the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On July 13, a Berlin administration Court decided that the clearance was illegal, and a day later went to police and workers under the rejoicing of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the street works peacefully: parents are walking with children, people sitting on the sidewalk before the houses in the sun, others are talking about späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the building projects, there are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist violence is not the main roads of many inhabitants: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives since 1999 in the area, and Jana * which attracts three children especially by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the building projects, they share the concern of rising rental and ventrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez, who wants to make up a multilateral polzeable on the left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin Insenator and the police have stopped between landlords and their neighbors, does not seem to exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlins was actually a traditional working-class district, which also has a lower pace in comparison to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">Landowners and the native Croatian projects have been around for long since: 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost all the Mainzer street near the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer were laid under great police on a regular road-hand corner, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigs and partly still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district of the past few years has increasingly become magnets for tourists and elecberliners from around the world: with them now residents of GDR times and former landowners share their area.</seg>
<seg id="21">This also has noticeable over the renting, which have risen since 2009 with re-hire for nearly 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newly built in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them at that slices or fresh facades which were subjected to color.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other street was mentioned this year along with the words" "" "left-autonomous violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality: offences such as body injury are almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the offences make Sachsentiments which make tendencial more of the newly built and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house for 17 years, next to the controversial 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As far as violence is concerned, it is more important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours that certainly did not have been.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous combustling cars give it right in the rigaer no longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is not a crime of criminals, on the contrary. "here one helps each other, lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has been consciously drawn into the rigaer street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">That's why it was also so important that the inhabitants left its road: from the police, politics and the media, who in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: by virtuous new builds in former buildings that thrills the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are ultimately property flats, which are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so good," she says.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "violence and destruction can I be absolutely non-healing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should we do if one never listens to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides of frustration, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For barracks, which sparkles more color-bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer got little understanding: the home projects and the left scene belonged to the area.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who bring out should be aware - just like anyone who moves into a bar area to complain bad about noise.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee officer</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organization.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition, it is social working on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July, Annika Deuschle is the refugee officer for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogy supports the team of managing Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees itself as a contact person for all players: refugees, Arbeitskreis Refugedorf, Administration, Authorities and who else will be mistaken.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer of the Arbeitskreis indicates that the volunteer is more than grateful that Deuschle is now that Deuschle is there, the eierlegende Wollmilchsau, which has mainly a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less fun as rather on the multitude of desirable tasks are purposeful - meant when the administration was to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sought was a administration of administration with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-term experience in the field of social work, just a viable Wollmilchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, administrative work is not their central area, but means Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Most of all it is about organization, work with local people and also behind the scenes, as well as network quality.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for approximately six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent place on three years in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Customer, that Catherine Deuschle ehrad- and full-time actors support.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers in the wash-road</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been recognized for some time, apartments for the cover loop that have been acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the application provision, the municipalities are responsible.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must put the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of building, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility varies from the municipal office to Kommune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">For some time the search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the management does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, it does not function so far as you rely on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, the community residences have to be visited as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are put up in the Wasp road.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keywords, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed bond, there are traineeships, training places, training courts, one-Euro jobs and benefits for refugees and migrants who have to be bolted or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help home-performance, do charitable work - and this motivates and very neat, like Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work is leading to a positive outlook.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">Working does not mean only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">The people would have to develop an associated feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are offers like sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So there can also be administration and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "it is central that the refugees get the feeling, they were welcome and welcome in Germany." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedures is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "they need to explain the refugees that it just takes and it can make it useful for example, for example with language courses." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">Who will eventually develop the feeling that he could not help with Urbach, should not work and be useless, that will never integrate itself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The distinct majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">Problem cases, however, also says customer honestly, "people in which nothing goes." the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two are afraid of the recent occurence of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "no," "" "says Regine customer can be very clear," "" "what mancher would like" "" "I would like to call it." "" "a balance would like it and if they want to exclude them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitised is the helper already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These allegations are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "people would have the fear that the attacks bring them completely in revocation." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with them," says Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main - and volunteers must keep on site and stand out in the region according to activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that a new shock in refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, do not shy politics.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to put them on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we are still not there where we want," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, this would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes clear that the Urbacher have already subscribed to the existing people to be integrated.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">However, if people are in need to help them both women are united.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
