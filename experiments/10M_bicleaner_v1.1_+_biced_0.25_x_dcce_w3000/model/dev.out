Obama receives Netany@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Netany@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement as well as in Teheran &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
but at the meeting it should also take a conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ states solution .
the relationship between Obama and Netany@@ ahu has been stra@@ ined for many years .
Washington has critic@@ ised the ongoing sett@@ ling nation of Israel and Netany@@ ahu is throwing an immense will in the peace process .
by the Obama announced by Obama on Iran &apos;s nuclear programme , the relationship of the two has deteri@@ or@@ ated further .
in March , Netany@@ ahu had invited an invitation to the Republi@@ can party in front of the US Congress a controversial speech which was viewed partly as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to the deliber@@ ation period in Israel .
in a emergency call professor who shot his girlfriend
in a emergency meeting , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on &apos;s Lamb with a somewhat tender voice of the police that he has shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
Lamb was important to empha@@ size that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but I still live and probably excited , and he said the family @-@ ship of dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
within the house we found the Lei@@ che of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a hand @-@ driven note that was kno@@ cked on a white block , I couldn &apos;t do it , I loved it , I loved it &apos; . this stood according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , in two on @-@ line courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ veland , Mississippi , signed up to 300 miles on the school grounds , where he was transferred to the police a popular culture , E@@ ane Schmidt , at the door to his office and killed .
Delta State University Poli@@ cia Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that Univers@@ ität@@ &apos;s employees heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb made the s@@ late emergency call after that .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police took him up .
a day after the shooting at the university , the students and teachers are forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an idea of what &apos;s motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators on both ends of the State , as well as what students and employees , who knew him , helped me to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers .
they said they were looking for his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier where Pr@@ ent@@ iss died , he did not have history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history .
he mentioned himself in one of his written book , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both registered in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose cur@@ ators includes 17 members , and many students visited classes of both .
at the same time , there were some incl@@ ine to problematic behavior patterns .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ avers , his Lamb , he also seemed a little excited and ed@@ gy , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes said that Lamb told him that he had said to do at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb previously had the Delta State University to ask a Be@@ ur@@ lau@@ ght for health reasons and said that he have some health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the Employment policies of the university signi@@ fied that the promotion had worked so hard for the Lamb that would represent no guarantee for an automatic way of working as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; universal President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he did not know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions , the Lamb is no longer able to answer .
after the flight from the campus the police found later Lam@@ bs track , when he returned to Mississippi p@@ Ark@@ ans@@ as .
before it could be arrested , he mort@@ ally himself with a .@@ 38 pot@@ assi@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home country on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still running away .
it was not immediately clear why lam@@ b went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grown in the area .
Lamb began 2009 his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,@@ 000 inhabitants , and taught Ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he prov@@ oked in the spring in Ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long @-@ standing friend@@ inside lamin@@ ates drew him as an intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Carla hairdres@@ ston said , she was 15 and lam@@ b was 20 when they met together through joint friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool old guy who tried a couple of years to teach her guitar playing .
he was then at the time of the Women &apos;s black .
all girls d@@ ressed when he was there , &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson pre@@ city of Bran@@ don .
Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss were obviously a couple of time together .
in the emergency call , &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage .
they had a dog named light@@ ning , who lived with them in the oven house that is adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ent@@ iss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced only 15 years ago , but friends have stayed and a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed in the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely the best friends .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he never met him but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb in music was interested and blues playing .
Lamb met Pr@@ ent@@ iss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail played three years ago both on a summer v@@ int@@ ing market .
later they played together the one or the other .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and performing her own music .
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was a nur@@ se , which worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ ke@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak spot@@ ted bar near the Gau@@ tier , told him Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss Night in the night 5th September for the last time saw his guitar and mouth harmon@@ ic play ended in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that anything un@@ anim@@ ous .
&quot; just a lucky pair , &quot; he said .
we were on the rebels and j@@ oking with each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of joke .
Schmidt , the dead Professor , appointed the first semester seminar programme and specialized in American native inhabitants and colonial history , Don All@@ an Mitchell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and became President of his Br@@ otherhood and the Stu@@ dents Committee .
on the Delta State campus in Cle@@ veland participated in the Tuesday evening about 900 people , including lec@@ tur@@ ers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ le@@ asing memorial service .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the M@@ ahn@@ wache , while the Univers@@ ität@@ sch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the classes will resume on Wednesday again .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said LA@@ FOR@@ GE .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ veland , Mississippi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans in this report at this time .
this story was corrected to re@@ voke the police now that Lamb created the emergency , and that Lamb described in his emergency call as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was remarkable for personal reasons .

UN @-@ Chief says , there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki @-@ Moon says that his response to Russia &apos;s military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years of lasting conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of men .
the UN leader calls again all parties , including the UN Security Council , to unite and Integ@@ rative negotiations on the final of a political solution .
Ban said a press conference in Wednesday that he is planning to discuss the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the Cab@@ inet of the General Assembly even this month in order to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ ts that the re@@ moves in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this situation is in@@ sol@@ uble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ban demanded for five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity during the crisis in Syria , so that they have proven in achieving a nuclear issue with Iran .
8 surround values , which show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a break .
but no matter how some Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans attempt , Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks to pol@@ ls at the bottom , it has ( yet ) not working .
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ dig@@ it area , and some begin to ask themselves what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ation of the estate Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course it is too early in the election period .
no claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nomin@@ ation .
experts empha@@ size that by Rick Per@@ r@@ ys was given up by Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership to the rising Herman C@@ ain , none of which ever won a state in the nomin@@ ation process .
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but outside groups like Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth will now recognize Tr@@ umps and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow him .
here are some current surveys that indicate that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Ha@@ iti@@ Pop@@ ular Templ@@ ates have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy to mid June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans saw the estate @-@ mo@@ gu@@ l &apos;s real estate .
until the middle of July it was 40 percent .
in the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now 6 out of 10 Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
some three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures consider themselves in early states .
a Fif@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has found last week that 60 percent of the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of dump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , they would be either &quot; delighted &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of them say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 per cent , they would be &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent , which tell the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next in things enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if everyone would Bush , the favor@@ it of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate .
a majority of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans can see Peri@@ ods Temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for its bom@@ b@@ astic and dec@@ ei@@ ving statements , 52 percent of the Republi@@ can conf@@ use Irish voters that the estate Mo@@ gu@@ l have the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first priority state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a com@@ mander @-@ in @-@ area , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent , that he did not have the personality to execute effectively , and almost six out of 10 inde@@ pen@@ dents say that his temper@@ ament not into the White House p@@ asse , so ABC / post .
Republi@@ can voters are used to the idea .
if they dis@@ continue her scholar@@ ship , maintain republi@@ can voters Tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked to win the GO@@ P nomin@@ ation after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C , last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
that is a change since the time when four out of ten end of July left its money on Je@@ b Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters in the past did not cover the crystal ball .
at this point in the last cycle four out of ten Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nomin@@ ation against only 28 % for the final candidates Rom@@ ney Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters are seen as plau@@ sible campaign .
even if the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around a different candidate , Tr@@ ump is still propos@@ ing .
some experts suggest that the frag@@ mented column is likely to join Tr@@ umps , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates diff@@ uses .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical mind @-@ an @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump supports multiple support .
he did before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points Le@@ ap , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before edge Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who struck him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneurs with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical mind @-@ at @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters have support , they say that they have fixed their voices .
of course , a lot can happen to change this , and no one can truly say that the opinion will never change .
46 percent said that they leave the door open to other candidates .
nonetheless , Tr@@ umps is the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say they coinci@@ de with tr@@ ump at issue of immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign was taken two months ago immigrants from Mexico &quot; rape , &quot; the migration and ful@@ crum at public dis@@ course .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic failure of Tr@@ ump @-@ Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can party and damaged the re @-@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / post survey of Monday , six out of 10 Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans that they agree with Tr@@ ump in issues of immigration .
as long as the immigration in the lim@@ el@@ ight remains , it will seem Donald Tr@@ ump to appear too .
the fru@@ stration of the government has to climb to new levels .
at Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son meanwhile , around half of the support of Republi@@ can constitu@@ ents , primarily by their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are also angry on Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three by four I@@ owa Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in the Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; wooden . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive apartment in Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg there is the most expensive apartment - with a view over the North Sea .
in the street is a square meter of a roof @-@ home with an in@@ cis@@ ion of 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt the supply of objects is natur@@ alized , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular g@@ ages will cost a square meter the most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really poor .
in contrast to Germany top accommodation , one of the price comes as a p@@ ter@@ kit .
the estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ ker has released a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square sco@@ oters in sw@@ elling heights .
that &apos;s several ten thousand Euros - per square meter , well @-@ marked .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is close not at the top here .
Champions League : Bayern @-@ Traum@@ start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
spar@@ ks Tor@@ bl@@ acks in Piraeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller just has a run .
a happ@@ ier hit by Thomas Müller headed the FC Bayern the way to a conden@@ ser 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pir@@ äus - then ran .
a sovereig@@ n glimp@@ se of the Champions League @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Champions Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have established a dream start to FC Bayern in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of Trainer PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola did her contest l@@ ude in the Champions League at the Greek recru@@ iting master Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to tr@@ ash double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and i@@ dol hit ( 8@@ 9 ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th company success in series will be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to pick up the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich .
Müller was awarded with his 28th hit in the Champions League to the Bavaria tour of fine mi@@ ra@@ ster of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who left one as an flan@@ k leg of the world cup .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; had Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ akis stadium promised before 3@@ 1.6@@ 88 hot @-@ blood@@ ed fans - and the Mün@@ chner held Word .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without sh@@ iny .
Pi@@ re@@ aus has won his recent six home games in the Royal class , including a well @-@ known club , such as Manchester United , At@@ or@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
2011 proud here also Bor@@ ussia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , which was defeated in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up Du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they were bra@@ ve to work with their offensive efforts but often influ@@ ential by works .
the attacks was often initiated by the beginning of the sun on Lin@@ ks@@ burg Douglas Costa , who was rarely en@@ ched against the former Braunschweig Om@@ ar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ella@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had left the right better than his f@@ ake shot from the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
during the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the potential 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities for half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
initially , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms Flo@@ ye Brown the head@@ ball of the Poland off the line ( 26 ) .
then by Direct capture , the go@@ al@@ location Roberto with the knee par@@ ched ( 35@@ th ) .
although Bavaria still domin@@ ating her usual game , Pi@@ re@@ aus has been able to re@@ lie@@ ve nuts .
but on door@@ ke@@ e@@ pers , Manuel Neu@@ er was abandoned .
so , as he took a shot of ide@@ ye via the Lat@@ te l@@ enk@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in the beginning of Neu@@ er , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola had a four @-@ barrel with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after mus@@ cular problems back in the Ka@@ der , sat first out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero gave a green light only after the final training , Mr S@@ ammer said at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wants to make something different from it , that &apos;s already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the first change Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sle@@ y Com@@ an for the Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Got@@ se arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) and made 13 minutes later everything clear , with El@@ f@@ meter , Müller pushed one more .
in front of the game the stadium came to Kra@@ v@@ alle .
after a smaller group of some contamin@@ ated Bavaria @-@ fans in their audience @-@ block the supporters of the hosts had prov@@ oked by words and ge@@ stu@@ res , attacked the security forces and went with head@@ ings against the Mün@@ chner trailer .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan has been inju@@ red from the stadium .
who smok@@ es , has a higher risk to lose teeth
who smok@@ es , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this puts an estim@@ able long @-@ term study close .
the good news : the risk drops as quickly as possible .
smok@@ ers have a significantly increased risk to lose their teeth early .
this is borne out of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute of Food Research ( DI@@ TH@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ sm@@ oker tables the risk to lose their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely , to lose the 2.5@@ - to 3,@@ 6 times higher .
the researchers had seen more than 23,@@ 300 students .
root causes of dental loss are c@@ aries and inflammation of the tooth &apos;s fl@@ esh@@ y , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E .
for this peri@@ od@@ ont@@ itis , smoking is a risk factor , empha@@ size the authors .
the connection between cigar@@ ette and dental loss tend to go back to frequent dental fl@@ esh@@ nia with sm@@ oker .
not clear , however , smoking increases the risk to tooth dec@@ ay .
people who stopped dealing with smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time of writing the researchers at the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
it can take over ten years until the threat goes back to the level of non @-@ sm@@ oker , the fir@@ st@@ tor Thomas Diet@@ rich declared by the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you must convince humans to become non @-@ smok@@ ers , explained the manager H@@ einer Boeing vom DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking short@@ ens the life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoke is good for lungs and vessels and leads to good dental health even to high age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of dental loss , DI@@ TI@@ E divided them .
previous investigations have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth dec@@ ay height .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ p@@ ate the findings .

EU Commission propos@@ ing a new court in dispute over the TTIP
to the dra@@ fting of the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic trade agreements TTIP , the European Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration systems .
the controversial private sh@@ red@@ ding facilities for disputes between corporations and states are to be dis@@ solved by a transparent system which in its way corresponds significantly more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ ström declared on the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sweden has decided to bring the proposal as a European negotiation process to the US @-@ free trade talks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TTIP is to create the largest free @-@ trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings are particularly obvious that the EU states and the US are jointly chosen for a new investment Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries .
for the first time this is also a second instance .
it would allow it to raise against jud@@ g@@ ments .
up to now , the tra@@ inees have reached each other on the refer@@ ee , a obj@@ ector against their jud@@ g@@ ments , did not exist .
in the discussion of the past months it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in matters relating to fairness and justice .
in the long term , she wants to work according to an International Investment Court in the long term .

the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) are considered one of the main reasons for the large resistance in Europe against TTIP .

Del@@ ik@@ ater Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens sits on the stage in the Köl@@ ner Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
beside him stands a fli@@ p@@ chart , to which the ti@@ mid @-@ acting fol@@ ks@@ singer has developed the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with film sti@@ ft .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is virtually taken from Stev@@ ens lecture .
he relates to various places he keeps on the map again and report about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and tender songs .
where they were created and how it looks like , in his homeland .
since then , Stev@@ ens proves to be wonderfully ten@@ sile
with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; appear smart songs , which vic@@ t@@ orious very close to American Folk of the late six@@ ties , but at any time into great op@@ ul@@ ent dri@@ fting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it arises the rum@@ or , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michigan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a cur@@ ved series : each of the 50 US states should be con@@ du@@ ci@@ ated in sequence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , already in 2004 and the area , already &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already been published and will positively break down certain expectations .

the album goes back into the American Bill@@ board charts and no annual report list of the influ@@ ential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after exce@@ ed@@ ingly productive experiments , Stev@@ ens serves themselves at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic ampli@@ fier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth arranged studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but carried by programm@@ ed sequ@@ ences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and Hall .
since the smaller clubs escap@@ ed , the sli@@ des@@ hows here become a colorful spectac@@ le of the ne@@ on @-@ forehead and large fluores@@ cent stage .

although here now nearly 2000 guests b@@ ans sitting in their chair , the clearly sur@@ fer Stev@@ ens returned to intimacy and to the folk .
without adding a word to the audience , the group plays excellent musicians through the wide @-@ based album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the audience you hear : the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; op@@ ul@@ enter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can basically throw the &quot; record &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns Deb@@ üt at the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n Deb@@ üt is expected to attend the Prime Minister with tension
his debut on the Prime Minister of Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to give his debut in the premiere of the Prime Minister and to apply for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to place the first of its six @-@ given questions shortly after mid@@ day , whereby his performance by the media is likely and the Labour MPs are likely to be tested .
he called &quot; fewer the@@ aters and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he has also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s guidance , because it is after his appointment as a member of the editor and after his speech at the Tu@@ c Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile the decision of Labour &apos;s chairman , on Tuesday during the decline of the National hy@@ mn at a commemor@@ ative ceremony to commemor@@ ate the 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ised by a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the center of several tit@@ le@@ tian @-@ stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision to sing is not the national hy@@ mn @-@ singing has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in respec@@ table silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the air @-@ eight to England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he was going to sing the Labour Day , &quot; independent &quot; of his faith that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadows of shadows have become up@@ set , in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns excell@@ ency , and they refer to differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party was originally supported as leaders .
the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also within the Labour Party , &quot; and in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns comments on the position of the European Union and the limit on the winn@@ ings .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the Tu@@ c Conference that Labour changes in order to remove the whole idea of a restriction in total .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions Minister , that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; be that they only be against governmental plans , limiting the limitation of 26,@@ 000 £ to 23,@@ 000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the Fif@@ th Labour Chair with David Cameron , since he has been T@@ ory leader in the last decade over the Dis@@ patch Box in the parliament .
the Labour chair , who promised to another politicians , says that he has given &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is@@ lington North MP said that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a confrontation and that it is carried out both &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stroke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the dispute with resistance attacks , and instead made it to focus on serious problems like poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , die Schatten econom@@ ist minister can represent him when he does not participate - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word and that he spoke to John Ber@@ co@@ w , the speaker of the &apos; farmhouse , to discuss the problem .
when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron , he told himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ The@@ theatre &quot; who often died with the issue of the Prime Minister . but some years later he ad@@ mits that he has failed .
since she was first sent on TV in 1990 , the question was noted with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position under his parliament@@ arians , even though critics had become a car@@ ic@@ ature , and imp@@ aired far @-@ reaching reforms .

Po@@ unds up by acceler@@ ated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound has increased dramatically after data , which show a rise in wage growth in the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was raised by the SA@@ BM@@ iller &apos;s goal .
between May and July the result grew without bonuses in the UK to 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period last year .
this percentage was the fastest lap since 2009 and brought in@@ estim@@ ations about the timing of a interest rate .
Po@@ unds rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 55@@ 05 and was climb@@ ed up to 40 % over the Euro to 1,@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index completed with an increase of 98 % to 6.@@ 22@@ 9,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after the acquisition of the R@@ ival AB In@@ Be@@ v was made .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ ona @-@ stocks were after encouraging messages from the competition Group for lux@@ uries , Rich@@ em@@ ont 0,9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures will count all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Mun@@ chen - announces growth .
shares of Glen@@ core came by 5 % after the mining operation was said that he had 2.5 billion $ absorbed by a public sale as part of his strategy of debt reduction .
the shares of the packaging and paper corporation MON@@ DI were the largest los@@ ers on the index , namely with a decrease of 4.3 % , after the prospec@@ tus for the company Rating for &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports has increased by 3,@@ 1 % after the first @-@ year @-@ year @-@ profit company had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 46.@@ 6 million .
the leader of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages will compromise the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; more buying power in the po@@ ckets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this buying power should be the higher labour costs at his company , he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added and this could mean less additional jobs .

PEG@@ I@@ DA poster brings as@@ pi@@ l on Pot@@ ato &apos;s idea
potatoes or d@@ ön@@ er ?
it is both - and in the Kartoff@@ el@@ d@@ ön@@ er , who developed the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay .
inspired by the Sp@@ ru@@ ch &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the PEG@@ I@@ DA movement , Al@@ h@@ ay potato and meat put together to a sphere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a PEG@@ I@@ DA demonstration with the ins@@ cription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potatoes instead of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potatoes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had random@@ ly seen in television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , there is a grill sp@@ elling in his store , which is fitted with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is multic@@ ul@@ tural for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay .
the idea has now become the Leb@@ anese Leb@@ anese in the meantime in Munich .
there , according to information provided by the authority , it has recently been protected as a manual sm@@ u@@ ster .
how much meat and how much potatoes the sp@@ ears contain , Al@@ h@@ ay does not want to reveal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only as much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes more &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even at its customers the international understanding of international understanding come well .
Met@@ cash start ground @-@ off campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - di@@ arr@@ he@@ a
Met@@ cash sought to protect Ig@@ A branches in front of an Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food @-@ wholes@@ alers Met@@ cash has launched a stance @-@ up campaign to defend the market share of Ig@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia start next year , Met@@ cash and Ig@@ A supermarkets strengthen their relationship with local food suppliers and rebuild the brand Ig@@ A due to mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ aide @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A @-@ distributors and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , which are distributed in Ig@@ A @-@ stores samples and shop owners , which serve tickets for the South Australian soccer liga to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash released a further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when wholes@@ alers surplus value for food , alcohol and equipment passes its annual investor strategy .
there is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia has almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Ig@@ A cargo ju@@ ices and generate higher profits as a met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Ig@@ A network in the Eastern states .
single B@@ apt@@ ist in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ or@@ ically provincial and Ig@@ A retail@@ er have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia in comparison to around 14 percent in eastern states .
however , anal@@ ysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley that Al@@ di twelve months following opening of his first markets around five percent of the food market in these two states is eliminated and all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
one week published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath made from Morgan Stan@@ ley that Ig@@ A @-@ retailers 360 $ million sales per year and Met@@ cash might lose $ 250 millions by end of 2016 .
this pre@@ diction is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open in the next year 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA and achieved a total turnover of 500 million $ and 600 million $ in each market .
the loss in the food and food shop and in quantities to Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost @-@ based , Met@@ cash may cost roughly 13 million $ earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , met@@ cash market shares in the East @-@ states , mainly at Al@@ di and CO@@ LES , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that Ig@@ A @-@ buyers are the most accurate .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s are sales in the food and grocery store by 3.8 per cent in 2016 and 2,@@ 1 percent in 2015 and 2.1 percent in 2015 will be reduced by 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , in business eating in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash probably will disappear within a decade . met@@ cash disappear .
Met@@ cash refused to respond publicly on the comments made by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is understood that a member @-@ member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass was in contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ A market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 per cent , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s dietary and wholes@@ ale trading , which has approximately 1.@@ 200 Ig@@ A @-@ retailers since 2012 has fallen by 43 percent , resulting in operating debt reduction with compar@@ ative print on turnover and mar@@ gins .
the wholes@@ alers surplus value however and invest@@ s more than 150 million euros , to increase sales prices with CO@@ LES and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths of hundreds of products each week at the same and Ig@@ A retailers in improving their stores by fast growing fresh food and deliver a better selection of private label food products .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adap@@ tions and charging stream@@ line programs can be set with ver@@ ve and hopes that the wholes@@ aler in 2017 will return for the first time in four years back to a profit .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ k@@ akis is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Kok@@ k@@ akis deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ k@@ akis was one of the &quot; col@@ ater@@ al damages &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick Knight gios and deserves more praise than criticism for his own behaviour .
Kok@@ kin@@ akis , the younger of talented Du@@ os , who again is referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; caught by the famous cand@@ les with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ inka at the Montreal Masters in the spot@@ light .
in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that , Kok@@ k@@ akis , and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison would be separated twice by the refer@@ ee : &quot; Wa@@ wre@@ inka would have to beat out Kyr@@ gy@@ z and I should propose the child . &quot;
while he was recently seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis r@@ acket after a cr@@ v@@ eil passed a potential US Open @-@ victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ k@@ akis was ste@@ ad@@ fast@@ ened by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ go@@ w , competing with Sam Groth , in the second place in the One behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup @-@ finals against Great Britain .
&quot; one thing I &apos;m pretty p@@ ei@@ ous , is the fact that after my view Than@@ asi was a bit pushed into the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he broke out a r@@ acket when he lost a shot in the US Open , but he is not the first player who broke out a bat with himself and I know Th@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has been in the US Open extremely well @-@ behavior , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deser@@ ved a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around her and I believe he was treated as a little one .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year old , he works very hard , and he doesn &apos;t fit a problem with other players , he is trained in the locker room , he trained very hard , he is a very stur@@ dy and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision , Kyr@@ gios at the important proposal to take into consideration which begins on Friday and he describes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common decision &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he as@@ sures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ long chain to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not on all the contro@@ vers@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe that Nick was quick in the climb , wor@@ rying about people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray . he goes up in the eyes of the public , and he deserves to support him , but we try to think him the consequences of his actions . some time outside the R@@ amp@@ en@@ lich@@ é that he can only think about it , and it is best for the crew and it is best for him .
European refugee crisis : Hungary declared Emer@@ gency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declar@@ es the emergency and depos@@ ited the south @-@ border with Serbia on Tuesday and held it all fixed , who tried to escape illeg@@ ally in the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border when hundreds of migrants accum@@ ulated in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and ser@@ ene officials with rebel@@ lion .
people who have fled up against violence were st@@ aking up for an unknown period in a rural stri@@ pe on the road between the two check@@ points of the countries and built tents , and settled down there .
but Fru@@ it@@ ating wins .
as a police helic@@ opter over them sw@@ elled , sk@@ in@@ ized the migrants &quot; Op@@ ens the border ! &quot; and rie@@ ve ins@@ ults against the Hungarian disposal .
some are going back from protest foods and water .
Serbia said , &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants would be returned to Hungary during more and more from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ ater@@ al harm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there will have to be held talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica dac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the Hungarian @-@ Ser@@ b Border came one day after the 28 @-@ nations block during a controversial meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could agree .
the Ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who were in the flood@@ ed Italy and Greece . they op@@ ted their hope that after all - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be agreed that the EU states would receive further 1@@ 20,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
but Hungary did not put its hopes on a bal@@ ancing action of Brussels or from its neighbors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Emer@@ gency shelter in two southern regions gave authorities more authority to get out of the crisis , so that they could reduce streets and asylum seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also att@@ ends the construction of a bar@@ bed dra@@ fts along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after it has finished a fence at the Ser@@ bian border .
C@@ BS News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison action at the race , used the bar@@ bed @-@ wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were deployed .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant trouble for war from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East , and became a major part of the input into the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sts that most in@@ coming economic refugees are those who are looking for a better life , and not war wings who claim their right - a view that is strongly contrary to other EU countries , including Germany .
the new laws , that occurred at midnight of Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall Za@@ us that led the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also place higher levels of pressure for condemned human beings .
&quot; due to the situation that is ar@@ isen through mass migration , the Hungarian Government explains the state of state , &quot; said Z@@ eller , z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs rep@@ or@@ ters in the southern City of Sz@@ eged .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still support the use of the military nor consent to the use of the military , who is expected for next week , but Rep@@ orter from Associ@@ ated Press have seen at the limit difficult to armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs .
Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities admit 45 people to try to cross the border , 15 other were already deeper into the country .
they come down by damaged the fence , they are now in police qui@@ zz@@ ling and are accused of supporting criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are there to fix the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials joined the Tuesday morning also two of the seven fron@@ tier crossing with Serbia , after a draw @-@ wagon with sp@@ ech@@ el@@ wire to close the borders .
chaos conver@@ ts the main border crossing nearby Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and put a crowd to push themselves aside .

2016 @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clin@@ ton Pre@@ leap in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national pol@@ l hal@@ ved
the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to have a double @-@ dig@@ it lead in the democratic race for nomin@@ ation at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her opposite to the ground .
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of democratic voters in the elections ( 58 % before ) , while elsewhere is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Bi@@ den who has not yet announced whether he is can@@ st for the President &apos;s Office , receives support for 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections .
more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined what candidates will support them .
but Clin@@ ics supporters are more durable in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups while S@@ anders obtained some profits .
Clinton holds a big edge in women and mind , but these ar@@ ches have less@@ ened .
your support among the men is significantly dropped , and elsewhere is only back with 5 points .
Clin@@ ton benefit from democratic voters under 50 years of experience are fle@@ d@@ ged , and they are now at the same height .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton has a big lead in the older voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , Clinton had been a double @-@ dig@@ it lead by the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 point lead to this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the elections pro@@ ud@@ ly say they would also support their enthusiasm if they were nominated by the Party .
a quarter would support them with some advantages and a further 15 percent would only support them because they are the nomin@@ ee .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ cher &apos;s current suppor@@ ter are especially impressed by her .
the views are stronger mixed with those who &apos;re not going to support Clinton - only around one quarter it would support her .
while 48 per cent of the democratic voters of the elections must say , they also support enthusiasm with enthusiasm , say , less republi@@ can voters do this about their counter@@ part Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ ie suppor@@ ter are asked in an open question why they want to be the nomin@@ ee today is the most common response that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that a woman is president ( 13 per cent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
by Clin@@ ton supports , her connection with Bill Clinton is also mentioned ( 9 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; consent to the dealing with the problems and voters are also quot@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the Vice President thro@@ ws a potential for the presidential policy , 57 percent of the democratic voters of the elections pro@@ voke him in the race - though a third believes it should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked for elections , who@@ ever would choose their second choice is bi@@ ds at the top .
by Clin@@ ton &apos;s fans say more than half , that bi@@ ds would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
decides Bi@@ den , will not decide for nomin@@ ation of democr@@ ats , Hill@@ ary Clin@@ ics rise in front of S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ ds in the competition on 30 points without it in the race .
five percent of democratic voters will go to the Clinton as a nomin@@ ee with the best opportunities to win the election ; however , this number of 78 percent has fallen by 78 per cent last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; Cho@@ col@@ ates &quot; has risen .
nonetheless , on the question of what is more important at a candidate , call democr@@ atically voters questions about the voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similarly , as in the last month , no single democr@@ at@@ ant candidate or potential candidate to vote for these voters of the elections is unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates bring good results with some important characteristics on voters of their party &apos;s elections .
Clinton View Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den cuts with the three candidates most at honest@@ y while maintaining power is the leadership .
thirty per cent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinion of him .
democratic voters in the elections also cover Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ological in accordance with their views .
during all of these measurements , about a quarter of democratic voters no opinion of something .
since questions about Hill@@ ary Clin@@ ton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during ten@@ ure , most of the Democratic voters of the elections are satisfied with their declaration of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions in total .
but it is another story in the American public altogether .
half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their statement , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion in this regard was in March , shortly after the problem itself came , split .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail account did not have an effect on their overall feedback from Clinton , though 36 percent said that their opinion has still deteri@@ or@@ ated .
they are mainly Republi@@ can , more than six of 10 , saying that their views from Clinton have become worse .
though Clinton is regarded by voters in their party as honest and trusted , this is still a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trusted , eight percent less than last month and 15 points since May .
62 per cent of the vote do not hold them for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time 55 percent of the elec@@ tor@@ ate nation@@ ally can also be seen as being honest and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump will get good notes at leadership .
from the six tested candidates , Bi@@ as , Car@@ son and Bush works best with honest@@ y .
a majority looks different rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 R@@ elec@@ tors in the elections is 6 percent@@ ages .
Ben Car@@ son is moving close to Donald Tr@@ ump and near Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is the latest on C@@ BS News / New York Times close to Donald Tr@@ ump
the two Candi@@ dates now decl@@ ines half of the support for voters in the new survey , and others lose dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters support nation@@ wide continues to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was conducted in front of Fox News debate over the past month to 27 % in the survey conducted by Tuesday .
but car@@ son f@@ lowed in the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received at demo@@ graphic groups and tr@@ ump among Republi@@ can voters with higher education education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ govern@@ or John Ka@@ sich , is struck with Wis@@ cons@@ in govern@@ or Scott Walker who is at deep@@ est by 10 % support during the last month .
former Florida Gover@@ nor Je@@ b Bush , the former Gover@@ nor of Ark@@ ans@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are located at 6 % on the third place .
the error bu@@ b at the sample @-@ test of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can elec@@ tors in this latest survey was Plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the recent CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was released last week , shows that Car@@ son desc@@ ends in the pol@@ ls - he launched 19 % support among the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the tr@@ ump of 32 % support .
the most recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump against Car@@ son .
having a look at one last week rising Car@@ son found Tr@@ ump some si@@ eves for the former neurolog@@ ist , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to put faith in question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump to last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;

five members of the Br@@ otherhood uses the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings .
almost two years after a student during a squ@@ ander@@ ing degree in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ ord@@ ances are filed against five people .
members of New York &apos;s Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Br@@ otherhood interven@@ ed by Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a fil@@ ing phase in September 2013 , and consumed its transport to the hospital , which has contributed to his death , shared the police .
official said he had been loaded with connected eyes with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked , while he tried to go through a frozen field on a target .
Mr. Den@@ g compl@@ ained finally about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Br@@ otherhood did not fire the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and wa@@ ited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , his symptoms , and Andy Men@@ g to contact the national President of the Br@@ otherhood to get advice , said Poli@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point the members of the U@@ ten@@ si@@ lien started to hide and put the welfare of the Br@@ otherhood generally over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ ef Wagner .
he could not revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning to his wo@@ unds .
after a Auto@@ p@@ sev@@ ent@@ een , Den@@ g has been added with bl@@ unter force injury to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the chic@@ ane of the Br@@ otherhood . at least a student dies since 1970 every year on the ik@@ anen , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , who represents the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accountable , and this step by public authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an indic@@ t@@ ment for the first five members for the first five members .
two @-@ thirty members of the Br@@ otherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with broken or@@ attack and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or officially - this sanc@@ tioned , we will also hold them accountable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Br@@ otherhood , and the national Br@@ otherhood has res@@ ist its affili@@ ation to the group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases it
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cal@@ ab@@ ber comes from , and the land@@ se will get into refu@@ ge , flo@@ wering for bonds will rise , and the economy will float into recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long that will last and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only a small guide to the procedure .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate and lasted twenty months .
the aggressi@@ veness of the Federal Reserve to raising interest rates is often , al@@ beit not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial investments react .
hence , representatives from the US Central Bank have stressed that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables have a role .
in the end , some market participants might notice that the whole excitement because of a Zin@@ ser@@ ber could possibly be exagger@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is in@@ vari@@ ably interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication of customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the grad@@ ual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still a lower level in order to a se@@ is@@ mic shock , which seem to fear many .
however , this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a key @-@ based trend based on how some areas of business could react :
as the market has seen last month , the up@@ take of Zin@@ ser@@ otes things can make things vol@@ at@@ ile for a while .
once the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is apparently a tendency that investments yiel@@ ds 12 to 24 months after the first increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analy@@ st in a newer study on what happens after Zin@@ ser@@ heights of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market has been in the past 35 years most likely - about 14 per cent - on the way to fork length , quite flat in the 250 days later ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal yield over the past six past cycles of 14,@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , the Bob Doll , Chief Planning department at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ ce@@ to occur later in the increase @-@ cycle and the return starts to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but interests them often .
in the current case , the F@@ ed has faced with some conditions prior to which there was no time and could speed up a recession .
most notable is here that the brood @-@ domestic product is close to its lowest point in a Zin@@ ser@@ height of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , on 118 Zin@@ ser@@ ums , has stood only twice the nominal GDP under 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.8 per cent , only few that this will last won and expect to expect the third quarter following the Atlanta Chamber of Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zin@@ ser@@ heights at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frag@@ ile economic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be ris@@ ky and throw the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this time is different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the German bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have made throughout the year a Zin@@ ser@@ ge@@ zation of F@@ ed , and all eyes were aimed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week which ends on Thursday .
whilst many o@@ int@@ ments and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could make an increase in that meeting , the fut@@ ures trading gives only a number of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all the Hei@@ ening cycles have taken place from 1950 to day in a super @-@ cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and before the rec@@ essions have put in the shadows very quickly after the start of recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest in which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are now 74 months .
the firm in@@ comes was also vol@@ at@@ l , as the market penetration up@@ grading , and the pattern is pretty similar as on the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than with shares , if they change their strategic course .
when bonds or return , the return will appear as soon as the first increase / lo@@ wering is done in the cycle .
at the end of the increase @-@ cycle the bond @-@ ends immediately falls , said the Deutsche Bank .
the str@@ apping of Charles sw@@ ab believes that the increase in interest rates will result in return between leng@@ th@@ less and shorter ones and lead to a f@@ ax@@ le of the curve .
high @-@ off bonds often bring better yiel@@ ds in such a climate , although &quot; we are still war@@ y to expect higher yiel@@ ds , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Anal@@ yst@@ in at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
interesting , Jones says that markets have already adapted itself to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from the strength of the dollar and the drop of inflation expectations there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of more str@@ ingent monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the tragic path is flat@@ ter , cre@@ ten@@ se have increased and the vol@@ at@@ ility has risen - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy .
in the large and throughout , businesses that benefit from the bulk of their operations in the USA , profit , when interest rates increase and produce local products more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt will be worse since a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also financing their debt .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares ten@@ ds to respond very positively , three months after an initial zinc @-@ cave , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s anal@@ ysts in a report for the customers .
companies with strong balance sheet have concluded an average of 5 percentage points after each of their interests in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yield as well as low vol@@ at@@ ility in their shares also met their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percent@@ ages ) and 3 ( percent@@ ages ) .
debt is a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most , said Gold@@ man .
outside of pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollars .
as@@ parag@@ us could see profits from higher profits , even if experts are different opinions how quickly that shall take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Female member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Conserv@@ ative member of the parliament critic@@ ized the radio because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; com@@ bing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is not to differenti@@ ate from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also brought on the BBC Music Awards and said that she was just The Br@@ its im@@ iti@@ ated
parliamentary colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins reached the program The Voice and said that this is not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; walk &quot; zu Classic FM , maintains a leader member and raises new pressure on the transm@@ itter , to prove that he does something to do something the priv@@ ately concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Conserv@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that the publicly @-@ legal radi@@ os@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is increasingly no longer differenti@@ ated from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I would not like to move the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to classic FM &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also represented on the BBC Music Awards , which started in the last December .
the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , seem to be The Br@@ its only under a different name .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples that you actually just im@@ itate what already is on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General dire@@ ktor pointed out the alleg@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 reaches far from its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and enligh@@ tenment .
what I learn from Radio 3 ? I will learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that truly is uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of radio 3 to find new music and to give new works to order , I consider it really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey decided to be harder to get involved , as it did in the past because the British are less informed of classical music .
radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport for it under fire came to appear in the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory @-@ MEP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins takes on The Voice - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was purchased by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for estimated cost of 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not especially distinctive ?
Lord Hall was insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Fa@@ ith and Boy George as a judge , &quot; was produced in a special BBC way . &quot;
he added , he also wish that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit out of our &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; own stable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if the next time it was a entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to ex@@ clude the order of other rows of The Voice in the future or to give money to the pay@@ ers for other am@@ us@@ ement formats .
Internet broad@@ casting wins in August at the s@@ lower and the Black Friday can be responsible for it
during the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
the last month has been the lowest result since the records in 2000 .
on @-@ sales sales increased three years ago through the use of phones to shop
experts believe that the Black Friday has stopped their expenses in November
for over a decade , the virtual dispos@@ able shopping has baked un@@ om@@ ited , and many of the main shopping streets of Britain have turned into gh@@ ost cities .
but experts say that there are now signs that the online transform@@ ations are stag@@ nat@@ ing after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales will be stag@@ nat@@ ing after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the pre @-@ years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG @-@ sales sin@@ es of the Guardian .
he explained that the online sales purchases made more than three years ago , as a purch@@ aser began to make their phone purchases .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do so in different environments , for example at home on the sofa .
yet now , this is comm@@ uted , and we may possibly experience that growth is reduced .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon which was imported from America is cited as a reason for the decre@@ asing revenues .
experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases from this event , which will take place last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers around their computers to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealers @-@ sites cr@@ ashed away .
experts believe that Black Friday to whom the buyers cont@@ est@@ ed because of bar@@ gain , buyers of them might stop to make everyday purchases .
a study conducted by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found that between $ 5 issues was issued more than 1 £ online .
in some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now available through web @-@ shops .
at the same time sold more than a quarter of men &apos;s clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inside .

B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap East European cra@@ ftsmen are available
British employ increasingly cra@@ ftsmen , says Veroni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified cra@@ ft@@ sman from Eastern Europe has an increase in itself

by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef @-@ correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is said that British governments perform their Flemish and brus@@ hes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European handic@@ ra@@ ftsmen , who carry out their work in their homes .
if you are sent with a hammer or a brush for the coming from walls , you seem to come to a minority .
they increasingly employ art@@ is@@ ans to perform their jobs jobs in their homes , so the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Véronique Lau@@ ry , new busin@@ ess@@ men from King@@ fis@@ her who owns the construction markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified techn@@ icians from Eastern Europe , offer prices to deep @-@ prices may have now out@@ dated .
hence King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ t Shops to open up to art@@ is@@ ans and 60 outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q @-@ shops , for eight out of 10 business decisions in store are made by women .
for the moment the men over@@ thre@@ w the men .
she said it was necessary to present itself to the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single @-@ households , which make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there still works a majority of men in our stores .
we need to move this stronger towards a balance .

women play a huge role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a UK in FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also launched a top team to reflect a compar@@ ative number of men and women in executive positions .
King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial status .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervis@@ ory boards .
King@@ fis@@ her announces a decline in the half @-@ year period and the parag@@ rap@@ hs , after the group gave the costs for closing the shops .

function@@ aries of A@@ I / DO@@ B due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the Landes@@ gericht Kl@@ agen@@ furt , on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian vol@@ leyball @-@ runner @-@ performance A@@ I / DO@@ B have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and de@@ for@@ ation .
the accused are not guilty .
one of them was charged also because of am@@ using .
this accus@@ ation he was released in May right in May .
the current process was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to Ober@@ sta@@ ats@@ tigh@@ ads Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in pre @-@ investigations that the accused made in the years 2006 to 2011 funds from the accounts of accounts recei@@ v@@ ated in their functions for private purposes .
the damage was charged with about 400@@ ,000 Euros .
the sport@@ @-@ works are also charged with financial cuts .
this fact is the Chairman of the Schengen Senate , Jud@@ ge Michaela San@@ in .
it should be wi@@ ped at a later date .
the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity made the defense that the association was not a asset not in any time .
the sports @-@ union could have applied only elev@@ ations and the sports club , for which she had spent much time and money in which they had done a lot of time and money , out of debt - the Passi@@ va beg@@ ru@@ es in 2001 around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( approx . 44.@@ 000 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then we were standing in front of the situation : do we hold the club or block us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; one of the accused , in the bread@@ th of the financial statements of the financial market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then decided to undertake this task with his colleagues and co @-@ accused .
with all the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have used money , which lives as certainty in the bank , &quot; he said at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sei@@ z@@ ure &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unless you agreed with the association : you can manage the money , there may only be no debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the pay@@ out of the compens@@ atory is compens@@ ated for as much as they had decided until 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , one portion of the approxim@@ ations were not compens@@ ated only years later , namely from the year 2003 when a plus has been in the account .
therefore , it also seemed Pau@@ le - and not detailed bus@@ hings , explained the former Ob@@ lig@@ ations .
accounts and as@@ parag@@ us def@@ enses the two def@@ endants in common , said the second in@@ def@@ endant .
why the withdrawal from the club were not disclosed in detail , the judges asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not interest in detail for financial security , it was important for the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as in 2011 against the one functioning of investigations , an amount of 1@@ 20,000 euros was reported on the equivalent account of the amount of EUR 1@@ 20,000 euros .
that is appropri@@ ations , the accused in@@ mate .
that trading account went on the name of the second def@@ endant and was not known according to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to know the Jud@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the answer for a long time .
then he said , he did believe that this is the best for the association .
if something had happened , nobody would have known something of this money , the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the room .
the ro@@ l@@ ament@@ ed sei has been informed , the function@@ aries of the function@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sli@@ ding &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why lik@@ eli@@ hood ? , we wanted to know the prosec@@ ution and the prosec@@ ut@@ or .
the first accused , he did not agree with this wording as the association had never made a damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with you are all of the hook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function said , he never did a c@@ ents , he put only od@@ le @-@ money and di@@ ets .
in di@@ ets , he added the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not be accused .
these be according to a operational test , in which everything has been judged as correctly , did not vali@@ date them .
od@@ le @-@ money also had the second def@@ endant .
all claims be made in cash , so that he must have to drive from his residence international market to the Bank after B@@ lei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
the main proceedings will be carried on September 23 with the witness of witnesses .

time of decision on interest rates for the US @-@ not@@ e@@ bank
the world is observed if the U.S. not@@ e@@ is spent two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , in order to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest rates are raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists requested by Reu@@ ters , found that a little more than half the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will res@@ ist slightly longer and keep interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0,25 % .
it is a historical event because it is seven years ago , since the F@@ ed interest was set to NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a big central bank is leaving the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , leading agent at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good performance level , in cheap dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate just a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ omy outlook for global relations .
she has warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs point out that the chances of such a step are good .

mir@@ acles at the Delta State University
after the shot and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later went to his pe@@ ers , and he wrote Sh@@ ann@@ on &apos;s a note to say that it would be &quot; p@@ ity &quot; with the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could make it impossible , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that Lamb , lec@@ turer for ge@@ ography and social @-@ scientific education at the Delta State University , calling the emergency number to 10 : 00 on Monday morning .
and said , he was shot on someone and somebody killed .
Lamb told the staff of the emergency situation , sending police police to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I created my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the sei@@ fer after his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when the police came to the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , who said , &quot; I am sorry , I thought I could do it back .
I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved . &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb &apos;s 300 miles on Delta State University , where he k@@ ick@@ ed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , kill , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening , as polic@@ emen turned him around .
&quot; &quot; &quot; universal President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he did not know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb apparently imagined that Pr@@ ent@@ iss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , it does not give &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Trinity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ ent@@ iss was founded by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who told she was about seven years married , as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good Person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were avoided 15 years ago , but friends remained .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ ent@@ iss would have a daughter who is 19 and she was destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss was their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ iss worked online from home , after statement by Lin@@ s@@ day K@@ now@@ les , who was identified by the Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ ent@@ iss .
K@@ now@@ les said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss , who poss@@ essed a dog named light@@ ning , who met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; they always wanted to help other people , &quot; said K@@ now@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , Lamb back at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as polic@@ emen he set it on highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in that night , Lamb goes his car to the side , flo@@ cking on foot , ran into the forest and sle@@ w himself with a shot .
Lamb received a doc@@ toral at the spring of 2015 from the Delta State University a Doc@@ tor@@ ney at the University &apos;s website .
stars , which have lost their happiness
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 he fought against le@@ uk@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , due to cancer .
the actor also alle@@ ged@@ ly got to fight drugs , and in 2008 he was condemned because of drugs .
all this certainly challenges its toll .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can not play Mon@@ at@@ ang because of double @-@ di@@ vers
do Sha@@ w er@@ lit@@ s with the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , a double fin@@ ca of his right leg .
while this att@@ ained the left margin to tears and ex@@ clude him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al gives hope not to be able to play Sha@@ w again in this season .
the injury was caused by a rec@@ kl@@ ess attack by Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was in the PS@@ V region .
he was treated at nine minutes in the pitch and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has double and is in hospital . &quot;
he will be moved up tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operates in Manchester .
it is terrible - a boy who comes together with 18 to Manchester United , it has been very difficult and then fantastic , and then this happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cri@@ ed .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double trial , then the six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy , a red map and the im@@ part@@ itions of a el@@ u@@ meter to be escap@@ ed .
Nicola Riz@@ z@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not pun@@ ished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee was mist@@ aken .
you can judge for yourself when I say that a El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were sus@@ cep@@ tible .
it was a very worse attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et in Sha@@ ws account : &quot; I thank you all for your news . words cannot describe how broken down , my way to recovery begins now , I come back again . &quot;
in this : Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at the PS@@ V
the England def@@ ender , with the Europ@@ am@@ eister@@ schaft in France added an added incentive to recover until the upcoming June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno f@@ lashes a leg @-@ quar@@ ry when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al Holland team at the 2014 World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear it is a very bad injury , that is not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , who was travelling in another direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with SB@@ S@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels like , I know how hard it can be .
I feel very bad about it . I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ Player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ try by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly , David Cameron The Lor@@ ax is better known ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not last long before you know it almost completely .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite child &apos;s book was asked , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 were created by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , he writes Cameron in a message on the site of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , turbul@@ ent , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book I liked to read my children because it seems always to give an image or a message that we &apos;ve never missed . &quot;
all nice and well except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron speaking the plot of book , instead , displaying a content of the movie version of 2012 , displaying new characters and details added to expand the fairly short original text .
&quot; in the middle of the w@@ alled town Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , he hopes to see a real tree , &quot; read her desire . a love @-@ interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theod@@ or Se@@ uss host@@ el lau@@ ded and the 1991 died , however completely unknown .
as if this were not dil@@ uted enough : the text is presented by Cameron presented as the summary of the Lor@@ ax film which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Datab@@ ase , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Audre@@ y , to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
though he zu@@ res there is a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron wants to understand the action of the book so little . here , an un@@ seen sitting , Th@@ need stri@@ ck@@ enden Once @-@ ler , despite the protests of the nam@@ ental bir@@ ax , a ho@@ vering , sn@@ ail , sn@@ ail , sn@@ ail , car@@ ve @-@ har@@ dened beings , &quot; which will pro@@ sp@@ ire in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a judge who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times a child in a row .
a Down@@ ing @-@ Street spokes@@ person said that the text was probably made by Cameron &apos;s elec@@ toral office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees , but there were no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly endangered from England &apos;s exclusion , but it is still difficult
based on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but when you selected the Ka@@ der , the England for the tour , is a repet@@ ition of the 3 @-@ 0 test @-@ series defeat is not on my map .
I would not finish a down@@ wards .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks Page is perhaps less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batt@@ ing list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not carry the s@@ cars of 2012 only a you@@ thful one positive attitude .
with the ball turns Mo@@ een Ali as spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown mag@@ nit@@ ude on Test @-@ Plan@@ e , is an option for the attack .
this is based on news : Adam Ly@@ ub@@ le@@ det from the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
the decision to let Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his boss in Yor@@ k@@ shire to properly analyze .
with his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but tough reality is that crime players are aimed at results .
there was no question mark upon Joe Roo@@ t , for example , and that led to the nomin@@ ation , there - and I said this - players have their own best selection .
a long time ago , one could have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own destiny .
and hopefully there will be further acquis@@ itions to Yor@@ k@@ shire , there will be another chance .
the England @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss assumes his attitude , even if he did not bring such good performances , and this does not surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question of how much time a test is received , to put its character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven opportunities - like Sam Rob@@ son prior to him - while Nick got nine got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to do home and adv@@ ancing .
the only accus@@ ation that you can rise was that England initially put Jonathan Tr@@ ott in the Caribbean when Ly@@ th was under the peak - but this lost chance now lies in the past .
alex Hal@@ es comes in , and he is a stroke that I highly regard .
he is a X @-@ factor cri@@ ck@@ et@@ player that we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he was sco@@ red with us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge where she met us very well .
he must obtain at least the same chances as the before him , but of course this depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to let Mo@@ een se@@ du@@ p beside Cook , which would bring an extra @-@ Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and four qui@@ icks would obtain , and I have no obj@@ ections to it .
I don &apos;t see why a stroke cannot kill there and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a devil @-@ sk@@ er@@ l from cri@@ cket @-@ players .
Mo@@ een maybe did his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is he a number 3 for them , and there is no difference .
my former team @-@ colleague Just@@ in Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at first drop until he performed in 2001 as a op@@ ener .
he was immediately made three hundred rings immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes into the Ka@@ der as Back @-@ up Sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he impressed me as a young man .
people may see their statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inn@@ ers who raise their hands and the co@@ aches have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made a few clever additions to the co@@ aches .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dee , the Bat@@ sman from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master@@ piece .
it is one of the nicest guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experience as it has played amongst all conditions and against all the attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes to the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup .
I always felt that he created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze in the locker room , even if the news stand in line with the hi@@ ker previously .
Coll@@ ys Team@@ mate with Dur@@ ham , Ben Stok@@ es , will not be used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , Roo@@ t received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team cards do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players will depend on their jobs .
such decisions are made no easy heart .
the Bre@@ xit @-@ bearing ( Bre@@ xit = exit Britain from the EU ) could gain un@@ question@@ ing if the economy is moving into a p@@ built device for 2017
David Cameron is in@@ hib@@ ited new L@@ unch strategy to hold the UK in the EU by getting deeper into trouble with each day , but without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is It Yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the guide of Labour or the Tu@@ c , which was fier@@ ce on Tuesday because of Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ ate fre@@ und said recently , that some member states , so deeply ent@@ an@@ gled into different crises , as the EU is now and not always from their own gu@@ ilt , Britain himself set out agenda with seg@@ reg@@ ated understanding and distur@@ bing changes that they often do not want .
in Brigh@@ ton , Tu@@ c decided on their annual meeting , that it does not like it , if they thre@@ aten the social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Self@@ ie agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb@@ ed at summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a picture of himself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it is always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wishes for an outdoor UK inside the EU @-@ tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and shows that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and Beam@@ te came up to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
German ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is a allies , but she has been in power for 10 years before it looks bad for her , as it is for the exagger@@ ated exp@@ editions such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
French President François Hollande takes a look at his re@@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a bl@@ ending power .
Poland might soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left hand .
it is hard to imagine that it will be a leg absor@@ bing to aid the self @-@ ie British , whose energy should be used better to prevent Scotland &apos;s emerging from the UK - something that they also do not want , because most similar advanced tendencies have ar@@ isen .
therefore , perhaps some such ministers may even be purpos@@ ely und@@ ated notes , quite in the SN@@ P style , during the UK refer@@ en@@ dum@@ my campaign to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , suspected my friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a ple@@ ite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won &apos;t a lot of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how to fle@@ eing the Fle@@ et Street to their costs and which EU sc@@ ep@@ tics is the oligar@@ chy of the Press@@ eb@@ ar@@ one as they were not at the by Tony Ben@@ n inspir@@ en@@ du@@ ms 1975 but not , which provided our entry into 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can be weak to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro Opport@@ unity , who has made a name for itself as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Ger@@ ade @-@ ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ 30s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all its cra@@ y@@ ness , Ed Mili@@ band , who were his enemies .
in addition , the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ caring Sch@@ ur@@ ks , phone @-@ h@@ ack@@ able foreigners and the p@@ seudo non @-@ In@@ countries , which possess the majority of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bl@@ air thought just about it , but noted that when you &apos;re sitting with a hot Gor@@ illa in a c@@ age you get better ban@@ anas in order to di@@ stract him instead of his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more bl@@ ur@@ ri@@ ans as a blu@@ air itself , as he rendered herself of Camer@@ ons Pap@@ en@@ du@@ ms@@ wir@@ bel , because Bl@@ air had rejected the principle beyond the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU which was then refused by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened to him a re @-@ door .
the press has never heard it .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me on Monday in Westminster a kind of wr@@ aps - I told him that he was no longer time for me to dist@@ ort him - seems to be in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t , but a strategy of 80 @-@ he years to repeat , a mistake at that time and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me but surely with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it very friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ary tendency and the wil@@ der Free@@ As@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary is a Ben@@ n , but not a Ben@@ n@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ in on the radio and on TV this week , when the sc@@ outs did in him , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns appointment of the pro@@ voke John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as an attack dancing is a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ he years , when his old father turned to be in television therefore willing to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet , without going too far and to lose its cabinet job .
Hil@@ ary &apos;s fight was still more attractive .
but to fight in order to remain &quot; under all circumstances - Ben@@ ns expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , still what J@@ C told his comrades and Members according to all reports on their cl@@ ause on Monday evening .
whatever the tou@@ ching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants you - remember that he even touched me - news discipline will remain important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a brood @-@ centre of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it is correct to give Cameron no free ticket to Europe which allows him to keep lab@@ ours support in the referendum for a comprehen@@ sion , such as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell it said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins think so .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic ambig@@ u@@ ities to the EU membership , in keeping with its anti @-@ capitalist economy - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ si@@ dents , for which the Nar@@ cis@@ s@@ sm@@ us of the small f@@ are@@ well is a central principle from dog@@ ma disputes .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son is un@@ convinced that J@@ C will not begin any campaign to leave , will try foreign diplom@@ ats to try to find in everything a sense of their supervis@@ or .
why should Paris or Berlin have wast@@ ed political capital - they also have suspic@@ ious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction in the T@@ ory government in power , where I was reminded of something that British Inf@@ lu@@ ence Security Forum was established .
experts critic@@ ise report from Public Health England via e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
alleg@@ ations of a state @-@ funded agency , that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) they joined The Lanc@@ et by limiting the use of Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; primary report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resi@@ li@@ ence of the data and directed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a editorial in the medical journal Per@@ et last month , the &quot; exceptionally wind@@ y foundation , &quot; on which p@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the asser@@ tions are based on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ ewell , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should rely on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estim@@ ation is that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estim@@ ation is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of sp@@ elling and mod@@ elling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who have been sum@@ mon@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ specific criteria Analysis ( multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to perform their opinions on the damage caused by various nic@@ otine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ago said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose head was previously mentioned by British American Tob@@ acco funding ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also wrote references from BA@@ T to Public Health in a Sustainability Report , they said .
one of the 12 participants stated in the meeting to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not financing that he should have received after reports previously received by the tobacco company Philip Morris International they added .
the reasons for selecting the members of the Gre@@ ase are not delivered , but include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes Champions , some of which also provide a range of industries in the paper .
some other participants in this session are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting the tobacco head took part from p@@ he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; b@@ lowing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; signi@@ fies that there is a lack of &quot; tough &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for damages on most of the criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ chic@@ ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or limitations are discussed in the p@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ago said that alleg@@ ations of p@@ he said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence up to now that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were supposed as a way to stop smoking for children or non @-@ smok@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he said that alleg@@ ations of BM@@ J was already re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long sm@@ oker dies in his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes compared to this are low , but that we still have long term effects to study .
p@@ he has the unique duty to inform the public about what evidence illustr@@ ates and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion over the relative haz@@ ards compared to tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0,000 people die yearly from a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the national health system two billion £ per year .
due to the clear demonstration of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should aband@@ on East@@ ends , says former Chief of Channel 4
the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should stop , programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice to send . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the Rund@@ funk@@ Fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK radio stations .
he critic@@ ized the BBC for publicly available programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard cont@@ ours can@@ als against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers as of BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC Director@@ ate , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations said Johnson said that he was working for six years in his time with Channel 4 without success to come into contact with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are in order or sends is clearly shown by not substantial ri@@ vals &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communication Committee under his investigation into the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the Rund@@ funk@@ Fee , what I consider in the medium or long term for a good idea , one should at least give his production on programs that others do not make or in order .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class window , because they want to reach as wid@@ est possible support for their future as possible .
the idea that otherwise no one would show this , is a joke , it is ridic@@ ulous , it is naturally non@@ sense .
Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs financed , which could also be financed without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ ders is another one , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
honestly speaking other channels would give their right arm to them .
I am eager to see myself how this should be public @-@ right TV .
I don &apos;t believe this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC is to blame for hunting for reviews &quot; because of the ambitions of the people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to ensure long term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC will again give what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC Shows would sell like East@@ l@@ ders .
Johnson said that the more open @-@ legal gen@@ eric programs &quot; to BB@@ C4 , &quot; where one cannot measure their tasks , and they could argue if they are going on their common missions to the justi@@ fication of 4 billion £ Rund@@ funk@@ tions , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all those ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
you put them into a window @-@ window in which nobody wanted to see it ever .
for the Rund@@ funk@@ Fee , Johnson said the board : &quot; I call you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can obtain the best value here .
of course , you think all , think that one receives a great value for $ 150 per year , but for people who is for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if that is true , as they do not consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ leader David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , urged the BBC to review and maintain its fri@@ th@@ ian mission . &quot;
he said , just little from the BBC production would now officially classi@@ fy as education - he said that there is 1 % of their TV production and 0,1 % on the radio - and she should take an example to the public @-@ legal television tap@@ es in Australia and Canada , and will keep them informed in &quot; inform@@ ing and enter@@ tain them . &quot;
the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like that of the Pro@@ ms , he said that only a handful on television are shown , and with the commercial Sen@@ ders Alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos; Son@@ ogen@@ etics &apos; can control brain cells by sil@@ ver@@ ence
the video shows how the n@@ emat@@ o@@ des are changing the direction at the moment in which they will be pun@@ ished with sound@@ impul@@ ses .
scientists have bre@@ d wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems , which can be controlled by exhau@@ sts of sound@@ b@@ umps .
the tiny n@@ emat@@ o@@ des change direction at the moment when it comes with sound impul@@ ses , which have high frequencies for human hearing .
the impul@@ ses are made through the switch of mot@@ ion@@ ized cells , which are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels , which respond to ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und cells .
are more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure , called Son@@ ogen@@ etics , used in ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und , to activate a number of brain , cardi@@ ac and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Hal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La Jol@@ la , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could take the depths of brain stimulation , a invasive procedure which gives electrical impul@@ ses in the brain of people for treating the symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
tor@@ n@@ ul@@ c@@ ers normally react to ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , found out , reinforce the ul@@ tras@@ o@@ unds , that then enter into the wor@@ ms .
the reinforced ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und cells have to be called structures , the TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels and be found in the membrane of some of the thro@@ ws .
the trans@@ duc@@ al cells under@@ mines the opening of these ion@@ ary channels and activate the cells to those they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und @-@ controlled mir@@ rors , the wor@@ ms of Hal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ ion@@ ization TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels carry .
when he turned ul@@ tras@@ o@@ unds to the altered creatures , the b@@ umps are enhanced by the micro @-@ flo@@ cks and into the wor@@ ms where they turn the modified mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ons .
the procedure has made some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gen@@ etics , a ground@@ breaking tool , which allows scientists to inter@@ play with neur@@ ons with the impul@@ ses of the light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ etics could have some advantages over this technique .
unlike light that has to be sent on an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain , the low @-@ frequency vibrations have to be hin@@ dered crit@@ ically and thus can be sent in the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und Signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

eight golden rules for living in student residence
eleven years ago I moved to a student dormit@@ ory , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral re@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those who I have up@@ set , and to the numerous , long @-@ lasting discomfort of others .
most of what I learned can dist@@ illed within eight simple rules .
the Enter@@ ing in student dormit@@ ories are easily sever@@ ely frigh@@ tening for up to absolutely da@@ unting .
it is temp@@ ting to tie @-@ out : people tell , where you get from whether and where you are a Sabbath , where you are going with regards to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you are &quot; honestly Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it is just a book@@ keeping ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distr@@ acts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in opposition to those with which you would not speak even if your eyelashes were off on fire and these fire ext@@ ingu@@ ishers would have been .
let people .
the rooms of people often turn into beverages , film @-@ night venues and commun@@ oral locations , but they are also places where people are attrac@@ ting themselves and their under@@ wear .
in this case , do not remember how to join the university with a relationship
int@@ ending contract is given a gro@@ ve treatment at the university .
your room should be a refu@@ ge , but many student residence forms a space @-@ to @-@ room @-@ speaking culture , which can be friendly and socially and can lead to life long @-@ lasting friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship goes on , but you have to go away , so that I get the energy back , which I have burnt for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a com@@ it@@ ones is exhausted from con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send it a text instead of kno@@ ck .
A@@ prop@@ os ank@@ lo@@ ke : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a haven was an invitation to be closed .
he saw some things .
friendship among B@@ aking .
since you start the Uni at the height of back Man@@ ie , the kno@@ ck at the doors of people to imagine having a dish full of brow@@ nies , less wei@@ rd as the welcome of the 1950 @-@ he years &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I made you something to smile . so , and now please smile if I present you a few personal questions . &quot;
homemade treats , is a good way to make friends .
your ro@@ omm@@ ates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain you and will eventually end your face with a delicious surprise .
of course this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
badly mixed cl@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people as@@ le@@ ep up if you pick up .
to ste@@ al food is a course for crimes in student residence .
of course , the cla@@ ws of chicken is a lar@@ cen@@ y , but is it the taking of a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check that with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to themselves themselves , even when they cook in the interior .
when someone ste@@ als your stuff is the annoying , and you have been my sympathy - but try to handle it as my ro@@ omm@@ ate that added their milk a so@@ ap to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .
it is now in prison .
they should make no noise while the people from sleep or from work is ab@@ sent .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent human being , but that in the true sense of pro@@ ver@@ b to the people , they belong to the gl@@ ass@@ house .
a girl in my cor@@ ridor asked her neighbors , whether it gave them something , drum and bass something quiet , for it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they re@@ acted with older music .
when they finally heard about 5 o &apos;clock , they kindly left their neighbours to sleep two hours before they left their own music , their door lock , and went on to their three @-@ hour examination .
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would happen by chance to enter the same student dormit@@ ory ?
the other way round , it would not be so deep embarrassing , if you stick to a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future sp@@ ouses , go down to them and then see them every day and perhaps they will experience how to bring together all common friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own paths - but if a hot ro@@ omm@@ ate is definitely not your future sp@@ ouses in mind , try at least to talk to your sub@@ du@@ b a little reason .
in the ex@@ iting moment in which you notice that somebody has its keys in his not closed room has left the border between a Ul@@ k and bullying , when it seems .
a good example is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes the b@@ um@@ er@@ ang .
place through bur@@ dock a valuable and am@@ using lesson via safety - but never fail one of the rooms with tooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
close your door and place your keys into a glass of water that you then put in free@@ zer - but ch@@ ack@@ ets your poss@@ essions at the ceiling for no more than twice .
ter@@ rac@@ ed houses for refugees , single @-@ educ@@ ators , t@@ ear@@ ners
the Im@@ plant Con@@ trac@@ tors Markus G@@ ild@@ ner is built in the Middle @-@ Frank@@ ish corner drug for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need shelter , but also the alone mother and the righteous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I show how one can still build good and well today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview
thousands of refugees will be pushing to the market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how quickly the living space can be created : it builds a project town@@ houses for refugees .
Mr G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees will come to the market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : mass @-@ mass accommodation in containers or turn@@ around has no sustainability .
for the people stay in a great part here .
in the light of the refugee stream we need sufficient living space within the next few decades .
a very ban@@ qu@@ ist , three @-@ sto@@ rey property is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a town@@ house needs the least place .
it makes things easier .
this is different when people sub@@ divide the people into accommodations .
each of the six homes that are being built precisely in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees will say it is back peace , I go back .
then the houses can be easily transformed according to their needs .
how much is the cost ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters of living per house , rises to 184 000 euros , without a property .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction has taken six months .
this is appropriate .
do the buildings have to make their plans complex ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : construction has changed my project correctly .
particularly complicated it is getting the dro@@ w@@ ading no@@ amo@@ red value of special construction and the plot of space .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
there is still sub@@ mits who creates three apartments in a detached house and needs at least three pitches .
only in cities is missing the place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the inhabitants responded to their Sem@@ i @-@ project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who have accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not true .
but tigh@@ ten you not the compet@@ itor struggle for affordable housing ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : true it is true : we have had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but also lux@@ uries that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the ordinary people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the alone mother or the bar@@ ter conden@@ ser .
I am showing how one can also build good and well today .

iOS 9 : how you get the new iPhone operating system if Apple @-@ Update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be ordered by selecting the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Previous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; app , and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready then the phone gives you the option to download and then install inst@@ aller .
some are gone after the installation to problems as they get an error , communic@@ ates that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to get the problem , users is recommended to either wait until the crash goes back or trying to update about iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ eting of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely to do that by elimin@@ ating the updates . likewise , it will be easier to delete it when you use a special tool making apps and then re@@ install it once the process is complete .
it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is up@@ loaded while updating or located near a charger , so the battery is loaded .
when the load is too low , Apple does not allow that the update will continue , as the phone probably could switch to half way and lead to a dismant@@ ling of the updates .

Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ Centre Anton@@ ist@@ i@@ ft have assembled themselves under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz a new approach .
besides discussions , you can also take part in the course of courses .

the offers from the elderly Centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal manner .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , precau@@ tion and re@@ hab .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Fel@@ ste@@ ausen and investing 310@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice by Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , Sam@@ t@@ ach@@ deb@@ us@@ c@@ meister Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ist in Uta S@@ eim @-@ Sch@@ wart@@ z and As@@ endor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert . &quot; &quot; &quot;
doctors in many places in the country are missing doctors - As@@ endorf , on the other hand , Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Fel@@ ste@@ ausen on the 1st of October .
during Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen on the retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is his successor to his successor in the coming months to the side .
after a uph@@ e@@ av@@ al phase , Müller opened its practice on 12 October , till then he invested 310@@ 000 euros into the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first glance when Frank Müller and his wife Dr Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll has met who at present completed their professional education in the den@@ dener hospital and who also wants to join in practice .
&quot; we always had in mind that the land@@ lords would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen and laughs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when so far I was just called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ph@@ oned it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
couple Müller liked the idea to run their own practice in the future in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and the constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says of 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we would like to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage he also sees to be his own boss soon .
and so we realized the gar@@ bage they bought the house with the practice .
live in the still in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there the second @-@ time family father Frank Müller also grew up , his Medi@@ z@@ inst@@ u@@ dium in Hanover , followed stations in several medical offices as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , N@@ ien@@ burg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a leader in Sul@@ ingen , in 2009 he was appointed for the leading not@@ aries in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is engaged in the DR@@ C @-@ willingness of Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from 19th September the practice for the new boss is being prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ste@@ ausen is working as a house doctor , his wife has specialised in Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ ni@@ st@@ in ) to the Gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Mül@@ lers , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as a veter@@ in@@ arians .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out therefore &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the reconstruction , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und studies as well as long @-@ term and resi@@ dual @-@ EK@@ GS , and we need a play@@ room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is entirely re@@ done .
a grant from a total of 500@@ 00 euros will receive the Mül@@ lers in the context of a extraction programme ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) , as well as by the Sam@@ t@@ ang ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; this shows how proud and glad we are that the practice is going to be continued , &quot; empha@@ sizes Sam@@ ur@@ ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ meister Bernd Bor@@ mann .
approximately 2000 patients coming according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll each quarter at the practice of Fel@@ ste@@ ausen , in the North @-@ German average practice there are about 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is another company practice .
a positive side @-@ effect of the practice @-@ effects by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains noisy Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor had been found , she would have gone .
who visited the Land@@ ing Expert Consult@@ ation , in the way I continue to look in familiar faces : taking the seven medical professionals and the cleaning of the field .
with their departure ends in As@@ endorf an era , after all , the medic@@ s have been practic@@ ing for 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; reminds of Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen sh@@ ac@@ kling .
a little melan@@ chol@@ y feel it after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are staying in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients will certainly still see , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ ni@@ st@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; your husband will be added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 @-@ square meter site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now I have always been pressed for gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , the couple has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls will also go high on our border to the limit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ iller &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is clear that everyone who wants to make a asylum application this can also be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the provision and security of the people stand in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but clear is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the minister said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , nor of the Austr@@ o @-@ slo@@ ven@@ ian border .
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia cont@@ empl@@ ating &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia
the Croatian government had previously told Slovenia , also Slovenia wants to continue to travel across Austria and Germany and under circumstances also set cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
this is what the Minister of minist@@ erial Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach though not .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia leads to the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary - intensi@@ fy .
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already far controlled as an border to the Schengen area .
as the minister acc@@ ented , it also wants its borders to refugees but not wear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government , the first refugees have already tried in the night @-@ time for Tuesday , have tried to check@@ out in the border crossing the T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d in order to so@@ ften the registration .
the Croatian police could open them in the nearby fields of mind .
according to local media since then , at the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik and constantly police vehicles meet new refugees .
it is primarily aimed about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
also lif@@ egu@@ ards and the Red Cross is already in use .
in the coming days , his country with some 4,000 refugees , said Interior Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo at the Maced@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ bian border that hi@@ therto migrants were led to the Hungarian border , in the direction of Croatia , Croatian and Ser@@ bian media commented on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade prove that it was , people in@@ wise to engage certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do it &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media report , anyway , in the morning , a first bus had arrived with around 50 refugees in the Ser@@ bian border town of Si@@ d , the course of the day would be more b@@ usses .
over Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the companions were travelling the whole night away from the approximately 500@@ km distant ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border through Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has zu@@ res , so the police said we should drive there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
in this way , it could actually follow the sc@@ ann@@ ed shift of the former Balkans @-@ Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat more western stretch .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
Croati@@ a.@@ &apos;s Minister of O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees that have corresponding plans for possible failure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call it , but he pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you conduct strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners and since then a good witness , which concerns the standard of border controls .
on ser@@ b@@ ischer side are still stuck behind the Hungarian Gren@@ zz@@ aun some 300 refugees .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media reporting , they had spent the past night on the border crossing Hor@@ g@@ os , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border trans@@ itions and back@@ pack Bre@@ g remain completely locked .
whether the remaining refugees wish to travel to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
the Ser@@ bian Minister of Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm part in Hor@@ si@@ os at a local point : he kept the debates on alternative routes from refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for early .
it would not currently be a very large number of refugees .
one could not say if they would continue their trip over Hungary , Croatia or any other country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants at - dangerous - alternative v@@ rou@@ ts
however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute the refugees trying to buy alternative routes by Croatia .
however , the border cross@@ ings between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the collapse of the Croatia segment .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police demanded that a team of mini @-@ sto@@ ols was sent in the border region .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s life , therefore we have gone through the action in the midst of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine L@@ ammer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice help is also available for questions and discussions as well as volunteers .
while some p@@ ant attacks the chal@@ k spont@@ ane@@ ously , and the proposition for &quot; my life affir@@ ms , &quot; must stop the war &quot; or &quot; not long suffer , then follow others , say , say , as far as I am not yet , and then go on .

therefore , this public opinion is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
that not everyone wants to tell on the tablets if it sounds , eventually it is a very personal matter .
the subject of death and dying is still gray with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine L@@ ammer , although just the hosp@@ ice movement in recent years have contributed much to the fact that the people open themselves .
a assessment , the Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id shares .
the death and the companion of men is one of the most honor@@ able employees of the first hour .
in personal experience the topic faced with the topic they read a lot of literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice for a call for volunteers , she immediately reported and went to it in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id belongs to a team of 45 honor@@ able persons - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes , and hosp@@ ice as Saint Vincent .
all are they carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id can do well with its role and experience and experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see the life of another waiting , stop it for precious , and este@@ emed the moment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the out@@ patient E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice service is free and inter @-@ denomin@@ ational .
the financial support of health insurance and donations from relatives and associations allows training as well as training and supervis@@ ors of the death and grap@@ e @-@ companion .
every two years , training is offered to new employees .

Fed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , Fin@@ anz @-@ outlook for 2016 reduced
Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appointing results for the last quarter , and the Lief@@ ert @-@ Gig@@ ant sees his winn@@ ings for a whole year due to the weak@@ est demand for freight services and higher costs in its water transfer service .
the company also said that she is planning to recru@@ it about 5@@ 5,000 chal@@ ance for the holiday .
at this point in the past year , Fed@@ Ex indicates that the company wants to adjust 5@@ 0,000 seasons of the season for the holiday season .
the share fell above 2,5 per cent in the Pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday .
Fed@@ Ex Cor@@ p. said to earn a profit of 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends in the next May , 20 cent lower than the previous pre@@ diction .

despite the price increase , the average prospect comes to an average of 4.@@ 9 per cent and will be effective on January 4th and despite the higher inf@@ il@@ ations for Bod@@ escap@@ ing gri@@ ds of heavy and large packages that are collected from November .
the company said it still expects that the result was increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher income and because of the growth in online trade .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; sound yiel@@ ds &quot; yiel@@ ds &quot; solid yiel@@ ds , considering the we@@ aker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;

in the quarter , this ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 per cent more than last year .
the earnings per share amo@@ unted to USD $ per share , almost behind the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of T@@ acks Investment Research asked analy@@ st predicted .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12,@@ 3 billion $ .
six of the f@@ acks asked analy@@ st , expected $ 23 billion $ .
Fed@@ Ex has reported a decline in the international primary disp@@ atch of the last few years to sub@@ st@@ ling the sales in its unity Express @-@ shipping .
but the boom in online @-@ shopping has pushed the results at Fed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher cost of greater packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded a higher revenue on account of higher prices , while the result was a result of higher labour costs in the cargo business .
in the Pre@@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares by 3,@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , on 15@@ 0.15 $ .
on Tuesday she concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below the 11th June .
on the most anticipated conference in the year , Federal Reserve Str@@ at@@ ula spent two days spent this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras &apos; ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to up@@ lift the leadership for the first time since almost a decade .
Dro@@ h@@ end about them at the end of the completed , two @-@ store@@ yed seat sa@@ wing is located a m@@ ural United States of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ Chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and their colleagues shall put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ annual order of Congress : maxim@@ izing the U.S. employment and prices here stable .
but since the big recession the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that there is an unknown party : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to di@@ ct it . it will be ready on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to un@@ acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed from the unprecedented interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data from the economy show that it grows solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets already sc@@ ure the more cau@@ ti@@ ous F@@ ed fu@@ elling justi@@ fication , to increase these vol@@ at@@ ility by raising the interest rate for federal states - and be it only about one quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labor market and inflation will be foremost the most important thing to watch , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist in the Ma@@ kl@@ er@@ company Sti@@ cker Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think when looking for an exc@@ use , the interest rate could not increase , the increased uncertainty about the global market is enough justi@@ fication , continues to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed is doing , which sec@@ ures itself to the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who recently were questioned by Bloomberg , have predicted that week .
the financial markets are expecting a drop of F@@ ed , with a key index indicator which shows only a 30 % chance of increasing .
this indicates a decline of the stock market if the F@@ ed increased the proposition , unless that the o@@ egen hit the blow , giving the promise that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday sp@@ rang the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage worth 22@@ 8,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy sustain@@ ing the set this week , John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sent@@ ences at this point , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they go very far in their statement in order to re@@ assure the financial markets so that it is not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that a Zin@@ ser@@ ber would calm the financial markets , because they would have the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
still a month ago the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the set by 0,25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow mer@@ ging of the mon@@ ary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had been in spring and early summer , that in this year despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the sentence .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ down , the improvement on the labour market in this year was solid .
the unemployment rate s@@ ank at 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and close to the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
pay@@ roll delays have shown signs of recovery .
and although the inflation ran constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives said that the main reason was the temporary impact of much lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , Chef@@ ö@@ kon@@ om bei Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but financial markets around the world reached the end of last month together after China had refused its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage was worth more than 16 % in May by more than 16 % among its top @-@ level as investors , that a slow@@ down of Chinese economy would under@@ go the global growth of th@@ rot@@ tles .
the market has a bit relaxing this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now nearly 10 % below the test@@ er of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ences are influ@@ encing the complex calculation as the interest rates will increase .
&quot; if events occur on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low said on U@@ C@@ LA Mac@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US @-@ Not@@ en@@ bank .
now he predicted that they will wait at least a month to get the effect better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers .
the health of the global economy is none of the main ones , so it should not be involved in their decision making .
but in the end of the end , the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was huge in recent years .
the mere note of the then Leit@@ ner Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed can claim their mon@@ et@@ ary expansion , &quot; prov@@ oked tur@@ b@@ ings around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly flowing with each other , can be monitored by the F@@ ed representatives , but also consult with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy .
their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; Z@@ ech@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , leader of the global strategy for assets management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , commented this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has an history of over@@ reactions to financial market movements that are apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als .
L@@ acker , un@@ authorized member of the Federal Open Market Committee , is advoc@@ ated for a Zin@@ ser@@ ge@@ tic , cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its benchmark increase by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited recogni@@ z@@ able impact on growth in the U.S. &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives made these cuts back .
the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a severe economic crisis such as market re@@ unification 2008 in 2008 , Adam S. Pos@@ en , former member of the Committee on the interest rate of the Bank of England .
the recent turbul@@ ence do not come near this level , he said .
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a Zin@@ ser@@ ber , because markets become exciting , &quot; said Pos@@ en , president of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t believe they should take the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life @-@ care for refugees
more refugees arrive from those days in Germany .
to prepare you with a warm welcome , does not work with the commitment of an honor@@ able worship .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
among them belong Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is with body and soul teacher .
also with their 74 L@@ enzen is still being taught .
every Thursday she does it in asylum seek@@ ers at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
they help refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , this is the very different lesson than at a right school .
Brazi@@ li@@ ens p@@ pa@@ edi@@ atric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS is trying to clarify in sho@@ cking manner women on how important good nutrition during the lact@@ ation period . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies which are painted at fr@@ actions that are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that babies provide all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
because of the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers get out to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake in order to increase about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results point out that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ et@@ etic adaptation that you should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pro@@ s@@ red women actually affects the genes of their babies and protecting them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively impact the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ tive
the municipal council Bern@@ ried permits the building for the 2.3 million Euros expensive sports hall .
and he did an exception .
the roof can be flat@@ ter for solar power stations .
planning for the long @-@ w@@ inter@@ ing Turn@@ hall@@ en@@ bau am Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ world come step by step : in the recent con@@ gest@@ ural meeting the processed construction of construction has been dism@@ issed without big discussions .
previously , the panel was adopted among other things another application to build a legal &quot; exception , &quot; non @-@ respected &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan .
with the &quot; exception , &quot; it took permission for a special form in terms of construction construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle distance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be built with non @-@ comp@@ elling First and umbrella &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
background of the planning is the prescribed use of green space for solar systems : &quot; thereby we get a wonderfully large South Wales , &quot; declared Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Liber@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again about the incl@@ ination which should be prescribed for energy reasons - different from the development plan - which is to be ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume of the hall is reduced significantly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for the ten@@ sion@@ ing is no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der is usually more restric@@ tive when it moves to liber@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we thereby create a preced@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Turn@@ hall@@ en@@ bau am Sport@@ zentrum is a collabor@@ ative project in the municipality and the SV Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros have been calculated at costs .
grants are expected by the Schul@@ - and Breit@@ en@@ sport funding .
in the next process , the construction amount will be filed for the 18 x 36 meters large hall now for the country &apos;s office .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ mb@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg should be closed before as scheduled - namely 2016 .
at the same time Dr Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of staff are drawn from P@@ ei@@ mb@@ berg with to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these shows surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the country district , the Land@@ r@@ ät@@ in Andrea Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß confirmed .
however , a decision on this regard is the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board , and the deadline for the next Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans are put into action then all of the approx . 50 employees in the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would be busy .
the vast majority should move with fishermen and the further existing in station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the staff that cannot be offered to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a job in W@@ eil@@ heim , so Shel@@ ter White .
the staff are informed about the plans .
triggered the change from Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been mist@@ aken first since the beginning of the beginning of the G@@ ong@@ auer clinic and is now moving to a private practice in direct direct proximity of the hospital .
on the question of who should join the succ@@ ession , he came to Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; fisher@@ man &quot; to play in the game who was prepared to take charge of October 1 and take the lead with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this is in every case a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a distribution of the quot@@ ation in the area of &quot; internal medicine &quot; , &quot; Joch@@ ner @-@ White .
Fischer is a specialist for grad@@ ual entry and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised on the inner station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic illnesses .
in part for the next two years Fischer will be in line with his team , if the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board will be attributed to both houses , until next year the former Hospital of Kn@@ app@@ age , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in Wei@@ ßen@@ burg after nearly 140 years .
so far the rural district had planned this for 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment was completed by the W@@ eil@@ heim hospital .
Land@@ r@@ ät@@ in Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also Chair@@ woman of the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board , announced rum@@ ors , that the house , which is owned by the Bundes@@ h@@ app@@ ement , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m out of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How it goes on with the property , Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say , there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present there are a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a di@@ ot@@ enti@@ ce atri@@ cs are accommod@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what owner could not happen , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer on the Qu@@ asi @-@ Mov@@ ing to the Le@@ ch that had been received positively by the staff &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and comprehen@@ sively &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house , in which Fischer has worked for over 30 years as a boss , did not exist .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to assume the post of medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ mb@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened in recent decades again and again by closing , departments have been closed , for example the surgery and Obst@@ et@@ rics .
the Hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhine @-@ Neck@@ ar lion is called for tonight ( 20.@@ 15 PM ) at the Berg@@ ische HC .
the leader of the Bundes@@ liga is in Wuppertal with the clear Favor@@ it , cause for clarity however none .
in the last season the Bad@@ ener at B@@ HC has taken a pain@@ less defeat and have something good to do .
Jag@@ dun@@ y with two per@@ sever@@ ing at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tra@@ kt@@ or@@ ers have been badly inju@@ red during her ma@@ ill during the morning session .
during the Aber@@ t@@ au on a Ma@@ is@@ feld near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several h@@ unters were in use as the police were rus@@ hed .
after an iron @-@ disp@@ er@@ d@@ ges a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man severe injury and were brought in hospitals .
how exactly this could come to the accident was initially un@@ clear .
C@@ id @-@ Police is established .
missed 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violence
a fact is a fact that the police led to the ly@@ che of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in the inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old had killed young people and left their bodies into a canal in rock@@ falls .
one since Saturday the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate is a perpet@@ rator to the victim .
the cor@@ pse of the young woman was found in the Tuesday evening in rock@@ burg near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as the prosec@@ ut@@ or and police on Wednesday .
as tat@@ to@@ ff , one also holds a 20 year old , who was in fact st@@ ating the st@@ ating and leading the investig@@ ators for the place of ly@@ re .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was missing on Sunday afternoon after she was missed on the eve of a visit to the autumn in Rock@@ enhausen .
in search of the young woman , the investig@@ ators put first into personal objects of the victim .
in surveys in the friend and acquain@@ t@@ ances of the suspic@@ ion , finally a Tat@@ suspic@@ ion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the dirty perpet@@ rators led the police then to a channel in Rock@@ enhausen , where the cor@@ pse has been found .
the celebrations given the authorities say according to the police examination , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and the bodies were placed in the canal .
the 20 year @-@ old should be pen@@ ed on Wednesday to the haf@@ ary , the investig@@ ators lay down out killing the burden .
the deadline for the near@@ er circumstances of the fact are to bring further investigations .
refugees need accommodations : study war@@ ns against housing pres@@ sures
the location on the German apartment market is ten@@ se .
also more refugees are searching for a paid b@@ lei@@ gh .
the pressure on the market is growing .
the social housing situation is facing a challenge .
the distribution of distribution on the German housing market have long ago began .
with the coming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU more and more people push for a market that is now over@@ loaded in many big cities .
you compete with income @-@ weak citizens in order to have the last paid apartments .
in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , it would have to build 400@@ ,000 different units by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to this result , a study comes on behalf of the trade @-@ debate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sozi@@ ale Wohn@@ ungs@@ bau . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison : this year , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany .
so there are 14@@ 0,000 flats .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees have no longer comm@@ its to live as an asylum seeker in an initial infection .
many then come to the apartment market and are looking into the long sn@@ akes before the flats .
according to the Stati@@ stical Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers were available to rent .
the negative development of the urban@@ ization is not only in the increasing number of refugees .
the study also makes significant fail@@ ures in the dairy policy of recent years .
Germany finds a residential defic@@ it in front of itself , which is greater from year to year .
currently missing in the metro@@ politan areas already occupied around 77@@ 0,000 accommodations , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many car@@ n@@ ants are therefore staying in large cities with not@@ ge@@ dr@@ ills in W@@ G @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults remained unt@@ amed for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the newly built @-@ in market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities the number of square meters per head has declined in the last few years .
to solve the problem , the Alliance proposes &quot; Social Housing &quot; proposes a rest@@ art .
in this case , new incentives for social housing construction should be restored .
thus , on the under@@ estim@@ ation tax , and the fundamental tax for subsidi@@ zed apartments are to be exposed .
additionally , according to Alliance , attractive tax @-@ setting options are necessary .
the support programme for refugee camps of the state bank K@@ f@@ W comes well in cities and communities too .
a good week after the start the Monday evening with 184 million euros had already been retri@@ eved more than half of the approximately 300 million euros .
now the project could even be har@@ dened .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia to cor@@ ridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is practically no escape to Hungary than any other refugees choose the path to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb breaks the transit of Slovenia to the north without hur@@ dles .
danger is the route however .
Croatia is joined by the neighbouring country with Slovenia about setting up a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; I talked to the Sloven@@ ian inner conductor and when it is necessary we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; the Croatian interior minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU @-@ country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
after the shut@@ down of the ser@@ b@@ isch @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees arrive to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported the Croatian television station R@@ TL .
Hungary had its border to its border for refugees .
new laws , which occurred on the same day , make a decent asylum in Hungary almost su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to make refugees happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through , and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there ; they are women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something .
but the people who were not in Croatia would not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had captured the first refugees at the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia on the morning of Serbia .
most of the media have been reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and tax@@ en in the Ser@@ bian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after arriving , she would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ bian border the refugees do not come across to Gren@@ zz@@ ä@@ une .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , the bor@@ dering c@@ als of other dangers : there still sharp min@@ en from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ e@@ räum@@ er should quickly create a secure fit .
after Hungary after the closing of the border , there is no more refugees .
on Tuesday the police demanded 36@@ 6 .
shortly before the gate on Monday there were still 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws are to overcome and destroy the Gren@@ zz@@ a@@ us as off@@ ence .
in the south@@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eged , therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated .
condemned for up to five years and exp@@ ul@@ sion exp@@ ul@@ sion from the country .
according to information provided by the immigration authorities , on Tuesday in the new on the border , &quot; Trans@@ vest@@ s &quot; a total of 94 asylum requests , nearly all - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applic@@ ants are 13 families with small children , as well as two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning , there were still 40 refugees there .
practically no one has granted a prospect of granted asylum asylum .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe country country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the asylum seek@@ ers should be shi@@ fted there .
in front of the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , there were only a few hundred refugees .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke we began to wait .
they gathered the gar@@ bage , which left the tens of thousands of people over the past weeks on the road@@ side .
pl@@ y@@ lo@@ p@@ ens were secluded and one of the entrance camp in the border site was rebuilt .
nobody really wanted to express themselves to the goal of this re@@ mod@@ elling .
Austria was reaching a few refugees after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
around 20,000 migrants were still facing government officials , but still in the country .
in Salzburg about 1400 people waiting for the trip to Germany .
the traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the German authorities .
in free@@ ass@@ ing , smaller groups of refugees met on foot .
Mayor of the &quot; Gest@@ ran@@ gers &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were together after the bridge quickly on Sunday with the fr@@ aming rooms , when suddenly ten people were standing with rice off@@ s at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BE@@ WER@@ P Mayor of the Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to get by train to Pass@@ au .
because in Sunday , however , because of the refugee stream the railway traffic with Austria had surprisingly heavy , for them was in Wern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; so Stad@@ ler that immediately gave his help and put the bases along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au .
before we have booked the un@@ guided guests only once , with J@@ ause and drinks .
we said the same , we will bring her by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was natural for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler in O@@ Ö@@ N &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man would not let it take , a generous donation to commit - 100 Euro for the fire@@ men .
&quot; this is very happy , &quot; says Stad@@ ler .
the stran@@ ds were started on Sunday evening in Wels by a ICE in a regional train heading for Pass@@ au , in order to stop it after the short notice that the railway traffic to Germany was stopped , but still trying to cross the border .
however , the regional train was placed in front of the border into Wern@@ stein on the Inn .
in Wern@@ stein the cross @-@ border is generally high in the course .
the bridge @-@ party with the Bav@@ arian neighbours on Sunday attended s@@ elli@@ g , Sundays before a two @-@ brid@@ led athle@@ tic - organized by the Union Wern@@ stein and Bayern from Neu@@ kirchen .
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án would now send further quot@@ as to us , is a logical result of a seem@@ ing policy :
instead of helping the concentration of structures in the construction of structures , our Chancellor , our German Chancellor , has officially stated and publicly released the position of the Hungarian government in the ancient kingdom of the National Soci@@ alism .
Lei@@ den@@ trag@@ e@@ dies of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now facing in the border areas with cha@@ otic states .
also the gra@@ vey@@ ards will have to realize that the &quot; praised country &quot; they invited and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp .
there will be a great challenge , given the continuing refugee streams and of the coming w@@ inter@@ ing , to establish decent conditions for protective exam@@ ining .
and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria are preserved .
Konrad on the search for 35.@@ 000 w@@ inter@@ firm qu@@ arti@@ eren
Konrad has all hands full with the refugee camps .
Christian Konrad is aware that his word has weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to release qu@@ arti@@ s for the thousand refugees .
the chaos in the first drill centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already been able to get a handle on this .
&quot; we have no more homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he wrote about his first success .
also the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who arrived on Monday to Austria were without a great tur@@ mo@@ il , Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; master@@ ship . &quot;
the House of Hom@@ eland was speaking of a &quot; kr@@ is@@ ous situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad can anticip@@ ate a demand of 8@@ 5,000 Qu@@ arti@@ s in a hy@@ mn year .
in order to meet the number , will have to be found more than 35,@@ 000 homes in the next weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries 15,@@ 000 of the coven@@ ant .
should there be more refugees , we can manage it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a hat@@ red without ground &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the local politicians he already had interviews .
and he promised to be responsible for the next refugees in Qu@@ arti@@ s .
&quot; in Ober@@ österreich it runs well , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Maier .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Car@@ dinal Christoph Scho@@ born , in doing so it shall be un@@ solved , as the Church will help .
great expectations from the asylum coordin@@ ator also puts in the OR@@ F promotion &quot; Hel@@ ping as we . &quot;
the platform can be able to offer individuals and un@@ complicated accommodation .
in addition , you will be reli@@ eved on hotels , which are empty in winter .
Konrad and Maier critic@@ ized yesterday the standards for accommodation as a &quot; very high . &quot;
in not@@ aries , it could not be that qu@@ arti@@ s must respect a certain amount of hand @-@ card holder or size in the light structure .
for a long @-@ term time &quot; need to apply &quot; standards . &quot;
that in contrast to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Konrad was more successful , Konrad with his experience .
I am an older gentle@@ man who does not say without further into the face of the truth .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Maier the Republic does not cause any costs as they explained .
your employees want to increase it from three to four .
the own Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ look has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with the approval .
Linz calls for better distribution
first , there is no opening of municipal Spor@@ th@@ es and other buildings such as Tips Arena and Design Center for accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
at the moment , this is not necessary , because those affected can now take place without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
but for the emergency , however , further sites should be tested for their di@@ pl@@ ine .
criticism of the Board &apos;s commission puts the division of refugees within the state of the country .
also other areas must contribute to its contribution .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not pic@@ tured &quot;
in a longer telephone at the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) held out for further action in the refugee matter .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer gave me assur@@ ances that the German borders are not pic@@ tured .
follow @-@ up of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany continue to be organised .
however , there will now be the corresponding border controls .
special moves with refugees to Germany will be no longer there .
but the exam@@ ining would however have brought to Germany with regular gul@@ ps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee demand . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that now Austria has entered again the border controls again in Austria , is for P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new ship@@ yard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new ship@@ yard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the stock company is appointed S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is supposed to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we have to attempt to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can imagine doing the new ship@@ yard in the start@@ up companies and later on to expand into .
from the beginning , S &amp; T aims to cooperate with the new neighbours - that of which remained a lot . &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is only a matter of time . &quot;
1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to a third of the city Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is respected by the Linz AG for 60 years on S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meter area in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent give it inquiries .
L@@ ia @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ er opened second shop in the arcade
in the new shop fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags stand at the center .
actually , J@@ Jutta wanted to put a dog in Jutta .
this under@@ taking had to move the 49 year @-@ year anniversary of L@@ ia Per@@ oni in the diving market arc@@ ades short @-@ cut and up@@ time : finally , it has now been expanding into form of another business location .
at the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the business , in which they sold under different po@@ ckets , suit@@ cases , shoes and gar@@ ages of various manufacturers , now all about women &apos;s hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , w@@ allet can be from 75 Euro .
larger pan@@ ni@@ ers and accessories costs up to 500 Euro .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
earlier , several weeks ago has been converted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long dra@@ fted if I want to open a store , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says broad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was among other things , that also the Fur@@ la @-@ producers who are in Bologna at home , from the idea of an own location where only their hand@@ bags have been sold .
&quot; we are the Only in the Gre@@ ater Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has himself Italian roots .
her fashion interest has been wide given by her mother in the cradle .
I do@@ cked the most when something develops and I can show new trends at reasonable prices .
why so some woman with sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in ench@@ ant@@ ment , the professional woman can not answer with last security .
maybe it is because a beautiful bag is called every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ lj@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pr@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this property also combines man@@ di@@ vers with the billi@@ on@@ aire , the U.S. president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for puri@@ fier .
whether he is notably expressed in vain , journalists aud@@ res or knowledge into the international crisis policy - the applic@@ ant for the US presidential office will be wir@@ led to the campaign against the American President .
and cut good on it .
this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ical K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the property @-@ milli@@ ard@@ ine origin@@ ate .
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is a term in many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf at the wine route .
man@@ cher in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ site is about -@@ zig corners with it is related .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ ine : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election campaign .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del has a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his aim to become more powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think that is somehow exciting , but are not deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters kind , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the cur@@ ved c@@ all@@ ele has turned out a am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous sho@@ ots , to which besides Tr@@ ump also the Ket@@ ch@@ up Family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump that is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to say in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
to the king of heart he did not have it there .
although there was respect for the performance of the family , but also je@@ zi@@ ble the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; is already a bit of a big m@@ uli , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inci@@ dentally the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ lj@@ es@@ etter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - too heavy @-@ German : the an@@ is@@ lators , says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump is therefore from the village of an@@ is@@ lators .
the tr@@ ump of success story began 18@@ 85 , when the later grandfather had mig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold @-@ gr@@ inding .
basic design of the property company were first land purchases in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from trag@@ ics : their desire to return to the country , failed at the Bav@@ arian state , to which the Pfalz @-@ time belonged at that time .
he did not recorded Tr@@ ump because he may be dism@@ issed once without a permit , had the Director of the Institute of pf@@ alz History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , to the Film@@ launch .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emig@@ rant &quot; .
this is contra@@ sts to the occasionally marked testim@@ onials of the after@@ ward .
he had repeatedly talked to the Mexican immigrants in the USA , and requested the construction of a border wall to ev@@ acu@@ ate illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as the pol@@ ish , that is not as sympath@@ etic &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relatives ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grand@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born @-@ born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the win@@ em@@ akers in retirement sees the Americans rather dis@@ soci@@ ate , &quot; he is always so intense . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump comes ?
&quot; I can not imagine , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never car@@ es around K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension inst@@ al@@ located in Veronika Sch@@ ramm mentioned like man@@ cher K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz with a visit something for the church organ ended , which was generally well an@@ ed .
&quot; I cannot imagine the Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
they f@@ ade it better , if he did not win the choice , for &quot; it has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had at the time of his grandfather had been in the U.S. the s@@ ages , it would have been as he , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Land@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are right without the President of Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star of documentary &apos; to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama over a recently twi@@ sted father who det@@ ects himself to settle his two children at the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million spect@@ ators .
critics were asked if Thom@@ son could have a hit show Solo without the rafting star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor von Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spect@@ ators and hit easily The Block ( 83@@ 8,@@ 000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26,@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results on the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 ) the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ep , sur@@ rendered on average 44@@ 6,000 spect@@ ators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 p.m. to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped on 6@@ 23,@@ 000 spect@@ ators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gui@@ ore Hot @-@ Seat ( 6@@ 13.@@ 000 ) .
on the Monday night , the first half hour was posted by The Ch@@ ase Australia 5@@ 20,000 spect@@ ators and in the second half hour of 1@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ seat above 6@@ 20.000 .
the decrease in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be optim@@ istic that Hot @-@ Seat will eventually en@@ force at 17 : 30 o &apos;clock .

the final three agree on : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
to un@@ covered the secret ? ...
Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have w@@ ingly ignor@@ ant who The Bachelor wins .
the woman , at the Sam Wood , at the Bachelor &apos;s , was gro@@ unded in the greatest secret .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not award if they are the one who has received the last rose .
but when we met Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three two , you might possibly acci@@ dentally give a reference to who the winner will be .
Sam Wood continues his lips up to the finale of the Thursday sealed
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all three women have left themselves in a ly@@ rical way of why wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , if the question is posed &quot; If not you , who ought to receive the last rose ? , &quot; they could become their answers to the play@@ e who won the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s .
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki no@@ ons both quickly - except for themselves - Mack@@ ay as the best partner for wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other on the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and ( Sar@@ ah ) and S@@ ams are noticed , I felt that they were fairly compatible and I had thought of that throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is talking with both feet on the earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; she added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be good as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , Mack@@ ay said that the Haus@@ er last week made her clear that Wood Workers &quot; &quot; &quot; could be &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally set to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked whom Wood should select , if not she , there it was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can tell that , &quot; she said .
I love the left @-@ left girl equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to begin his NF@@ L career .
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in moving into the US - and there were many other teams working after his impressive training day over the last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a clever decision .
some trainers would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank as he lost a bar@@ angel so deser@@ ved the Aussie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League series at its first p@@ unt return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Min@@ nes@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a p@@ unt return and also to the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula made his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of remin@@ ding its ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team by the mill he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne also publicly available in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ re@@ porter , In@@ man told that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams , Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who ri@@ et him to forget his scr@@ at@@ ched catch and to take care of the next game .

&quot; that was a thing that happens sometime , you just takes care of the next game , and that is it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it does not go ahead , we need to get to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Free &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leader &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
off @-@ off asylum seek@@ ers want to exp@@ el the Free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore Ai@@ w@@ anger also requested more staff for the administrative courts , who are responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seeker , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 people killed , after polic@@ emen rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal after the police scre@@ ened in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a official said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on the eve of the district of R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , Chief District officials , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , with some of them bri@@ cks and fire bom@@ bs war@@ ns .
Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said the police have used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and then shot in the air before they picked on rubber bul@@ lets .
20 Poli@@ zi@@ sten and five civilians were wo@@ unded , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets , known to kill them , but they are traditionally used as fewer deadly alternative , apparently such a high death @-@ rate produced .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nept@@ une &apos;s southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ adh@@ esi say that new provinces to be formed within the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence .
there were protests in the Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus , who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officer , were in violent conflicts since the 10 .
August killed , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to div@@ vy the country into the provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been a centuries and a very controversial issue in Nepal .
working on a new constitution since 2008 has been on the way , but the legisl@@ ator acceler@@ ated the process after the devast@@ ating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April .
the legisl@@ ator have aligned this week over certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional design in Kathmandu and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .

however it was good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors now .
some ten to twelve million Euros expensive projects have been in discussion for months .
intensive reactions among the sea owners who had come to the meeting they called for the photos and new details about the desired hotel building .
Roberto Schulz , Meer@@ bus@@ den@@ owner and CEO of the lob@@ by@@ ists of An@@ lieg@@ er , Pro H@@ ieve , aments : &quot; this is a huge cl@@ utter@@ er that over@@ looks all the other bi@@ kers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , he fears as many other project leaders that would strongly increase traffic through the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be entire bus lad@@ ders so that anticip@@ ates &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz
what is exactly about the well a hectares of large ar@@ rest of the former Gast@@ stätte , is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we need to have a conclusi@@ ve concept &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ralf B@@ ehr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Google will start double @-@ in donations to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . o ) announced an anti @-@ double donation campaign to help thousands of refugees trying to help thousands of refugees who handed over the countries of the European nations as they fle@@ e from the war of tor@@ n and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of the donation call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager of letting the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google assistant who is escap@@ ed with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our journey there were many dark railway and bus trips , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as the refugee and migrants crisis grew up in Europe , many people like my family are des@@ perate for help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google said that the first global accum@@ ulated donations has doubled up to 5.5 million at its stake in 11 million $ . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year war civil war in Syria , which has sold more than 4 million people this year .

for slightly overweight di@@ ab@@ etics can be a weight of weight .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for a new study at least five years .
it is still too early to say whether easily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the death data need a long time to show something , &quot; Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of the weight loss surgery , which wrote a editorial to the new study in J@@ ama Surgery .
weight @-@ loss operations or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of mag@@ nit@@ ude .
they reduce hunger and limit the physical capacity to include food .
over the years there have proven obesity operations for treating type @-@ 2 diabetes as efficiently , but most studies were carried out in people who are path@@ ly obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , some degree of weight regarding size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I above 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Data , which have collected it since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obesity surgery - Mag@@ ni@@ b@@ yp@@ ass and Mag@@ en@@ schl@@ au@@ ch@@ ment - including medical treatments for type 2 diabetes for people who were easily overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those who under@@ went this operation decreased from 31 to 24,@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those who received not @-@ surgical diabetes treatments roughly equal to 29 .
those who under@@ went a surgical procedure , has taken care of 36 % the diabetes @-@ condition completely and at 28 % .
in the medic@@ ally @-@ treated group , in comparison with diabetes is fully only at one percent and in part , only about two percent .
in addition , the results with the controls of the blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; found the authors out .
the researchers also all@@ ay the patient @-@ blood levels of hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c that reflects the blood sugar levels in the course of time .
Hä@@ mo@@ welt bin A@@ 1@@ c is best held below 7 per cent , then write the researcher .
after the surgery the average Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level declined by about 9 percent to about 6 percent .
in the medical treatment group there remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as you do in the improved ha@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level - does not decrease the mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researchers Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compare the average results with the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year the b@@ yp@@ ass surgery @-@ group had lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching bigger decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 % vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % ) and reported rather a total move of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16,@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery , after five years , there are indications from a study of he@@ avier persons in Sweden , that Operation performs a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was subject to obes@@ e people who under@@ went a obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that conventional methods were attemp@@ ting .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgery @-@ patient , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I below 35 , who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without elevated risk of death or kidney disease , she told .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long before we take people to take this seriously &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once they accum@@ ulated these genetic changes that have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes is a revers@@ al really hard . &quot;

&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ news
Europe could not record all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and imp@@ lied that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East .
the Tibetan @-@ Buddh@@ ist leaders urged to end the violence in the countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of continuous refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford that are dedicated to ethics @-@ studies .
he called on the circumstances for the interests of humanity to be taken against the interests of individual nations , or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries is ad@@ mi@@ red to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not adequate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the Dalai Lama &apos;s Dalai Lama and Austria &apos;s efforts in dealing with the crisis , he emphas@@ ised that there is only a temporary solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but meanwhile you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , like a true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end we must think about how the k@@ ill@@ ings is reduced in their countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; he added .
the Dalai Lama promised to the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack from September 11 and turned out that the violent reaction of the US moved to a chain of un@@ control@@ l@@ able events .
after September 11 , I have expressed my conf@@ ess in a letter to President Bush , and said to him , the way to resol@@ ving this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put force one , and this has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; the Dalai Lama promised .
four @-@ fold increase of intake of hand san@@ iti@@ zer for children over the past 4 years
Gi@@ ft@@ Control@@ s in the USA report on almost 400 @-@ per cent increase in number of children under the age of twelve , which are strong on hand san@@ iti@@ zer , so Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord , Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , having gone the cases of income of manual inf@@ ect@@ ants for children under 12 years that report the tox@@ ins control centers , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 on 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly common to these products , and sadly a percentage of them go to emergency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants are purpos@@ ely drinking while some do it to impress their friends or for an MU@@ T@@ PRO@@ BE in social media .
show videos on YouTube , how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants are only drinking because of a cheap memory .
young people have supp@@ os@@ edly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants using soft mou@@ th@@ wash to get a tough@@ er drink .
younger children can be caught by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a kid doesn &apos;t think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are par@@ ones .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with stra@@ wberry , grapes and orange @-@ du@@ g which are very pleas@@ ing for children .
suspended inf@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially with inf@@ ants can already result in a few dri@@ fts to alcohol po@@ ison@@ ing .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; re@@ ed Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical Director of the Gi@@ ft@@ not@@ ebook in the Hospital of K@@ ans@@ as , the Sender Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would not let go on whis@@ ky whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in reach of children , and if children come to it , then it is a fast way to consume much alcohol .

&quot; this was very wor@@ ris@@ ome , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ affir@@ s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has been recommended to parents and teachers , to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and to store hand san@@ iti@@ zer outside the reach of the child .
about alcohol po@@ ison@@ ing out were some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants associated with deaths .

there are a lot of tension in the old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games .

it would offer a unique perspective .

the det@@ ention authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pin in order to raise what I see .
I simply have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma proved me to im@@ pose myself on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prison@@ er , as he wants and you get access .
I tell me about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it ad@@ mits that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have put &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it better artic@@ ulate &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks that it is false , what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problems with some of the things I said and wrote .
he does not tell me what I have to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I said to him that he may remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants that a international re@@ porter is present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement against death will help the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a rep@@ atri@@ cian of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is next to me sitting .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have done .
I do not want to deal with all the details here .
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is inde@@ cent .
his acts after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benefici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ eli@@ hood is that it is not guilty of the murder .
I &apos;m sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death section .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can not claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porter that you can apply for this .
what you will get from me is what it means , a man will see an in@@ estim@@ able death .
man after dam@@ p police @-@ eye @-@ hunt , from the Cann@@ ing River to come
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale polic@@ eman were dry when he reason@@ ed the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
an attempt of a man of Perth , to leave the police , was un@@ successful when he removed himself in the sil@@ ken and sw@@ amp@@ y water , a few meters from a police officer , who tried to persu@@ ade him sof@@ tly , to the shore . &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was set on Tuesday to a peaceful quar@@ ry in Beck@@ enh@@ am .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them towards Cann@@ ing River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I come not out , kom@@ m and hol , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine .
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ hav@@ ec was not too enthusiastic about making its Uni@@ form wet , so he turned into a reliable tactics , &quot; A good polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes people funny things to try to escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
master@@ ship @-@ football stri@@ ker Ben Cous@@ in offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 she continued c@@ ous@@ ins in the dit@@ ch to escape a alcohol @-@ control and then tried to swim over the Swan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben Cous@@ in bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy maintains that ste@@ wards trying to send him out and threatened with racing sport
Peter Moo@@ dy maintains that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria have tried to install a sp@@ y in its st@@ ables last year and thre@@ w the race immediately .
he represented on the ste@@ wards and the Integ@@ rit@@ er department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race of race treatment , the last St@@ roh@@ hal@@ m on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do that which is best for racing sport and he himself found themselves under difficult conditions , when it was about the positive cob@@ alt preparation sample at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
he had with@@ held 18 months because of the sp@@ ying pro@@ aches and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; out as to be too high bun@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; I had to say nothing to say about this , and I have long been eating out , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that all come out once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .
you know that it continues .
sometimes you have to react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with that which I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I &apos;d like to kill all about it , and I want my owners think that I am trying my best for her .
if they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be more trainers .
I then have to think what I do with my license .
previously Moo@@ dy &apos;s bom@@ b had prop@@ elled the bom@@ b in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the Integ@@ rit@@ es department had tried to absor@@ b his stable .
&quot; before 18 months ago Ter@@ ry Ter@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart in a room with a man - whom I &apos;ll be asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com
but they clearly believe I am a sc@@ amm@@ ers .
if that is the case , they should certainly put into their n@@ oses , because they attempt to grip , to have failed .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , ehem . Chairman of RV@@ L , David Moo@@ die , acting president of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the RV@@ L , were aware of this time and still are today .
should I consider that this will be personally ?
does the RV@@ L act as co@@ war@@ dly and is perhaps responsible for people outside instruc@@ tors so that what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there , that I am .
perhaps they must take my license and stum@@ ble me , and I have no doubt that what I say , what I am thinking about it .
but I arrived at the point now which doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad .
this makes me really sad .
I will put pressure on them , and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the Fru@@ ct@@ ose levels of the trainer will have built up with the long lasting cob@@ alt @-@ examination in Li@@ dar@@ i and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to him that he could throw his license on the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by its preparation of the un@@ marked master Black , signed the race day treatment &quot; ridic@@ ulous &quot; after a pack mud or sound pointed to the horse deb@@ ating , what is viol@@ ated against the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has er@@ ron@@ eous conclusions on the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so .
it had also been so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month di@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set these rules don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; we all see rules , but here you go too far , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy beats against ri@@ vals due to alleg@@ ations of ring
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy spent criticism of the tac@@ kling of his players as an &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League &apos;s favor@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee will be allowed the Storm players &quot; ring@@ struggles &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying finale in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co Trainer Way@@ ne Ben@@ nett made a few disgu@@ ised note to the Storm team , having achieved the final victory against North Queensland Cow@@ boy on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; Mu@@ ster@@ ile &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland does not be too good &quot; in rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the tor@@ ch of his crew and said that they are focused only on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading co@@ aches to his team would confi@@ d@@ ently voice him , as it wre@@ cks that they were worried about being struck by the Storm team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this appears again and again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson am@@ id@@ ed about ring fights , when she left us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that in the whole year we have nothing changed at our opposite system or techniques . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ cles on a real focus and that has been provided for us the revers@@ al ice .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to lose so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is already funny as this is still coming up to this season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy idea attacked his ment@@ or idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and his ment@@ or reminded that Ben@@ net@@ ts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragon won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; te@@ di@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Way@@ ne is talking about exciting football .
he was compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was a boring team , and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of a she@@ ath .
but now he has a team who can play and this we as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game , which you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt for playing them .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried against us .
six weeks ago they probably didn &apos;t think of us when it was about big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ sters has achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against Cow@@ boy .
the game of bronze was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are Pau@@ sen doing and do not make any points a gri@@ pping ?
for me it is the sched@@ ules .
if they mention ourselves , it means that we will be meeting them in a phase yet .
the Storm team has free this weekend because they have won the right to receive the North Queensland Cow@@ boy or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday evening at the Oc@@ top@@ us Park . the ticket office will start starting next morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ Deposit on Dru@@ gs K@@ age
a man , that may be a lifetime punishment , because of his experiment , to come in possession of 40 k@@ ilo@@ grams , co@@ ca@@ ine , which was scr@@ at@@ ched to Queensland , was fre@@ ed up against a deposit of 200,000 $ .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men arrested the last month after the Federal Police took 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he met his fellow @-@ def@@ endant at the marina in the course of the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Ro@@ adh@@ ouse , where the police found 40 k@@ ilo@@ grams of the drug was found in a Toyota Echo .
despite having a possibly living punishment for attemp@@ ting to possess a commercial volume co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic that he tried no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café could have been out of an harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter F@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the poverty of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travelled to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the prison , he gave the police about his place of residence .
Mak@@ si@@ veness y mother and a step@@ father were offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to reach his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the ei@@ re@@ tender explanations of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jud@@ ges Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent it from it , not to appear , warned him .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against deposit , under the conditions that he left his Australian and Ser@@ bian pass , announces itself daily in the police and sat down at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

Stuttgart : rush of Tro@@ pen@@ stur@@ m &quot; Henry &quot; in the South@@ west
Meteor@@ ologists war@@ n against b@@ mb@@ ö@@ en in the South @-@ West of Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ nach@@ mittag an .
because of a low pressure area across Western Europe , warm sea air at currently warm sea air into the country , divided the German weather services ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart with .
the powerful reason@@ ing was the prec@@ urs@@ ors of the tropical storm &apos; Henry , &quot; who was drawn from the mountains of the Ber@@ m@@ uda islands over the past few days .
fier@@ ce storms and storm are expected especially in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , even until Thursday morning , also in the Black Forest , on the we@@ ar@@ b al@@ b and in soil @-@ seek@@ ers with Bö@@ en from 60 to 90 kilometers per month .
after Friday the sun raises much longer than the sun again .
the mass makes it : every two years the car buil@@ ders on the I@@ AA show its novel@@ ties .
2015 above all is a movement in the compact car which is currently especially well sold .
cars from the comp@@ ass class are currently especially important : about 28,@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations dropped according to Kraft@@ werk Office ( KBA ) alone in August this segment .
this is reflected in the I@@ AA ( publication on 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the fut@@ urist@@ ic conception and new Ober@@ kl@@ asse@@ - and luxury cars are presented this year mainly a lot of new compact models .
one of the largest pre@@ mier@@ es for the German auto industry is the Opel A@@ stra who will stand in the autumn with the dealers .
&quot; the A@@ stra is an extremely important model , &quot; said Opel &apos;s head Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it is part of the core of the brand .
so the full @-@ volume model is also sold well , the new A@@ stra is not much more expensive too .
Opel is performing an entry beneath the biggest compet@@ itor VW Golf in view , starting at 17 650 Euro .
the current A@@ stra costs from 16 990 .
A@@ stra has a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 HP .
the H@@ esse offers further diesel and gas@@ oline engines of 70 kW / 95 b@@ hp to 147 kW / / 200 b@@ hp , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder engines .
unlike the most important compet@@ itor VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel A@@ stra is at first only as five @-@ five .
as a second variant I will follow in the spring of the com@@ bi which is already visible on the I@@ AA .
and what will be forced next to A@@ stra &apos;s A@@ stra on the I@@ AA yet to new comp@@ ass vehicles ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of his A@@ stra @-@ compet@@ itor Mé@@ gan@@ e in the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively as a five @-@ five in a conventional and an acc@@ entu@@ ated sporting GT @-@ version .
in the trade he comes at the beginning of next year , then also as com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan Alliance wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact f@@ iti agre@@ es with its cur@@ ved lines fully into the design line of the brand .
the base model will get a gas@@ oline engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 PS .
there is also a diesel engine with 80 kW / 109 HP or 125 kW / 170 HP .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno that celeb@@ rates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gas@@ oline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter tur@@ bom@@ bed and a power of 82 kW / 111 HP .
the maximum torque lies by manufactur@@ er@@ angaben bei 170 New@@ t@@ meters ( Nm ) .
the launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not quite new but completely renewed is the compact class D@@ od@@ ell DS 4 , which is visible on the I@@ AA .
outside bound the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ se@@ wer above all hand at the front @-@ part : here the radi@@ ator &apos;s grill has been new and the altered head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ mentary system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons lab@@ elled by a touch@@ screen and for the first time Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play .
in addition , the I@@ AA in the comp@@ actor class has added a number of designs and new variants such as the face @-@ by Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five @-@ metre cells are deser@@ ted
the Federal Constitu@@ tional Court has given to an explosion @-@ prison@@ er of the im@@ prison complex , which has been housed in a small cell for mon@@ oc@@ ang .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the violation of its dignity , prisoners would be entitled to compensation for financial compensation , when they remain in small cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was adopted the Tribunal of the Federal Constitu@@ tional Court in one on Wednesday .
suffer@@ ers may even hope for money if they were imprison@@ ed only a few days in the too tight spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
in this way an ex @-@ H@@ äf@@ t@@ ling was successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in the judicial prison Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a cell @-@ cell with approximately five @-@ square meters floor space ; the bathroom was not separated .
after that , the man who has now returned on free foot according to his lawyer , has moved into a larger cell .
his am@@ t@@ sh@@ af@@ e@@ age caused because of un@@ worthy defence conditions against the land of Berlin indeed failed .
but the Constitu@@ tional Court took away the decision of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al in Berlin and will refer the case to the renewed examination .
they see the human dignity of the man viol@@ ated .
Kammer@@ Court now decides on level of compensation
even if for legal reasons from the question of question only a few days of haf@@ tt@@ age for compensation have been significantly , there was a special appeal , it was called .
otherwise , &quot; would be to fear a w@@ reck@@ age of the legal protection of the personality . &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ al must now clarify the height of the dent@@ ure@@ ments .
the Constitu@@ tional Court often have strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
so they spoke first in April of a w@@ ain@@ t@@ ling compensation , because he was naked in a cell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 , according to the multi @-@ specialist of a cell without separate toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday in addition to the Berlin Constitu@@ tional Court , who had agreed to an in@@ mate in a parall@@ el@@ fall in November 2009 .
the dam@@ al@@ ous pl@@ aster was taken over three months daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons have come into the head@@ lines in the past few weeks as well .
prisoners are therefore always enclosed 23 hours , the aggressi@@ veness rises , even to h@@ unters , it is due to be ten@@ se due to the ten@@ se situation .
according to information of the Just@@ in@@ press@@ est@@ elle , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of Nach@@ wu@@ ch@@ sm@@ angels , 19 shall be falling away .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
approximately 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany after forecasts for the Federal Ministry of Finance , in this year , according to the Vice @-@ Chancellor S@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take off a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated with the un@@ common challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this , and we can create it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
they are used for different forecasts ranging from 35@@ 0000 ( estimate of the German Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the Pest@@ el Institute ) annually - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is the lack of housing , but above all in large rent properties : every year 600@@ 00 @-@ 800@@ 00 social apartments are out of the ten@@ ant connection , and the particularly favourable apartments are also submitted to refugees .
federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants therefore to double the promotion , from currently 518 million at one billion euros .
far too little , that from the point of view of the Pest@@ el Institute : 80 000 social apartments would have to arise and for this , the federal government should invest an increase in the amount of 6.4 billion per year .
the aim of scientists and the federal government agreed that there must also be more tax benefits to investment in housing .
according to estimates of the Institute for labour market research and vocational research , it is assumed that over the long term , 55 percent of the p@@ oul@@ try in Germany can be inv@@ ali@@ d .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be asked for their qualifications after getting their entry , Claudia Walter , project man@@ ag@@ ress for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann .
but the integration of refugees is crucial if they find jobs in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the esteem in respect of the society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , the migration researcher Diet@@ rich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ ner , there has been a political revers@@ al : from the Labour offered for refugees to recognition of labour .
while there was an employment ban for asylum seek@@ ers from up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just as the resi@@ dences , the asylum seek@@ ers is restricted to a place of residence .
in society - also because of the shortage of qualified labour - a majority of view on the view of which refugees should be facilit@@ ated more quickly to the labour market .
a large hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing German .
so far there is still no exhau@@ stive offer of general and user @-@ related language courses .
studies also show that jobs are often convey@@ ed through personal contacts .
the set up of networks is therefore under the view of Thr@@ ab@@ hardt of the König@@ s@@ weg for the work of labour .
the Berlin school administration has established that few refugees give their children to the Kit@@ une , estimated at ten to 15 per cent : &quot; for the practiced parents , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ sch@@ ky , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management of manual paper distributed in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators are shar@@ ply rising by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the apprentic@@ eship , e.g. by increasing more specialist schools .
in the countries we are prepared to receive students without a knowledge of welcome .
but they are not always taught by fully trained instruc@@ tors and teachers , but also as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
to them there is no shortage , says Be@@ ate St@@ suit@@ case from the Berlin administration .
the German Stud@@ enten@@ werk will be able to study about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany .
in principle , no Bundes@@ land asylum seek@@ ers or Ged@@ ul@@ fed the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , In@@ sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its position .
with refugees , access to the university might be facilit@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for refugees with a re@@ im@@ bur@@ sement of or le@@ dge do not receive any achievements after asylum seek@@ ers more , when they begin studying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter are fundamentally without a BA@@ Fö@@ G as they do not fall under the circle of the disabled people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patient refugees had to be eligible for four years in Germany to be eligible for BA@@ Fö@@ G rights , from 1 January 2016 to shor@@ ten this margin to 15 months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also this financing needs to be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Ber@@ lins Under@@ secret@@ ary for Science , and the German Stud@@ enten@@ werk .
the students should immediately receive BA@@ Fö@@ G .
Islam will play a more important role in future , for many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should en@@ force the same rights to Islam and follow the same rights as the churches , and to develop the existing state @-@ church law to a new state of religions .
important would also be the founding of an Islamic welfare association , which is professional about the new@@ com@@ ers .
among the rights are also obligations .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on a clear contact person and be ready to cooperate with the state in many ways and give it certain control options .
this also includes willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed the concern on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany .
those who were coming to Germany such conflicts in Germany have immediately their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; said in Bay@@ rische Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
integration will continue to be a topic of the whole society in future .
thus the majority of the majority of society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is urgent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - for a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ discrimination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a gender equality law &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it lear@@ ns very slow as the NS@@ U M@@ ord@@ atur@@ al series showed , in the police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist mot@@ if .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and stakeholders are preparing for a long time , and commit to international agreements such as the anti @-@ racial configur@@ ations in Germany , needs to become reality in the next few years , if the country will remain peaceful and its new citizens are meant to take advantage of their chances - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany was able to provide medic@@ ally for the anticipated refugees , says Tobias Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; what Man@@ ic@@ ism and capacities are concerned , we create this , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel .
however , the extra money does not flow into the system .
in order to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , we demand Mont@@ gom@@ ery , to all the deriv@@ atives immediately during the registration health cards .
the achievements could be claimed later with the Bundes@@ länder .
and in the long run , it is highly question@@ able so many people are subject to food demand that the asylum application is subject to asylum .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , doctors will do better to create the language barriers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
already until now , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are raised worse at their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical offices , would have to be taken over interpre@@ ter charges .
a lot of refugees would also be helped with more gener@@ aliz@@ ations in emergency terms .
and with another diagnostic view .
under refugee camps for instance , there are a much more un@@ poll@@ uted disabilities , and for the young people go to HIV education .
with the partly other cases of disease , German doctors spoke about their education , but clear , says Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ it@@ ism or tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so hard to recognize , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what does the poorest people go through the refugees can possibly even be lin@@ dri@@ an in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans had a highly developed education system , several refugees too are doctors .
to be practic@@ ing , however , they must demonstrate their qualifications and specify a test again .
at least half of the refugees in Germany in@@ coming refugees shall be sick after estimates of B@@ und@@ esp@@ sych@@ otherap@@ eu@@ ing ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) mentally ill : most suffer from post @-@ trau@@ mati@@ zation disorders or among depression .
particularly vulnerable , refugee ry , explains Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study of the TU München shows that any fifth , Syrian refugee is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
anyone who is suffering from an post @-@ trau@@ mati@@ zation of trouble is suffering from among other things on the so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with respir@@ atory , Sch@@ win@@ del , Herz@@ r@@ asen and deadly .
additional symptoms are ins@@ om@@ nia and concentration , strong fri@@ ction and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms of chron@@ ically would be chronic , be a timely treatment required , explained Mun@@ z .
so far , only four percent of the psych@@ ic @-@ related refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy .
though , psych@@ ically sick @-@ ill asylum seek@@ ers can put an application for a psych@@ otherapy , but usually the processing takes several months .
in addition , they would usually decide in social dump@@ s or doctors who are not trained for the psych@@ ic diseases , whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this is often lead to fail@@ ures , says Mun@@ z .

&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine , without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephanie @-@ rehear@@ sal , Tier@@ teacher and Jun@@ orch@@ ard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto the current management is about . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tried the cir@@ cus in the hands of the family for over 33 years .
the gift to inspire the family so in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are important to take away people away from their day @-@ day times and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year Jun@@ orch@@ ard . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Man@@ usi is cock@@ tail with world @-@ flair , &quot; so name director Reinhard Degu@@ st his concept .
50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometres long tour can now experience this air .
the program of the cir@@ cus convinced with talented artists from around the world .

abuse in the attitude of cir@@ cus @-@ animals are only too often subject of different animal protection organisations .
Stephanie testing also takes a stand : &quot; it doesn &apos;t matter our animals well , we are not doing well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents take a match .
the &quot; four @-@ legged artists &apos; like they are aff@@ ection@@ ate , will be read after the possibility of every wish of their eyes .
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
feel the animal does not feel well , it does not want to get into the ring .

the zeb@@ ro@@ id is still not ready for the ring , but for this it &apos;s the unique mas@@ cot of the cir@@ cus .
therefore , for each visitor it is likely to be something .

Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe puts false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s guide , fell down the steps at the beginning of the year .
he did not hurt , but the video of the case quickly became popular over the social media .
the opening of the parliament was also com@@ promised by com@@ promises of members of the opposition that they have been anonymous and warned that they were warned of Mr Mu@@ gabe , by Mr Mu@@ gabe , with Bu@@ hr@@ op .
in the last month they had extended him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent gon@@ ese said that seven Opp@@ os@@ ition@@ ed politicians have received SMS messages on their phones which they warned that Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ es Add@@ ress to distur@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but she did the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; he said journalists to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they warned the affected Parliament members that the imm@@ unity in parliament is ending , and once they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary imm@@ unity is no longer effective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the director said that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i guided tour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will tra@@ verse up to 30,000 work@@ places
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to construct 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the framework of the restructuring and savings efforts in the Company &apos;s services .
HP will later expand into two listed companies in this year and separate the computer and printer business by his fast growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected job rate brings to a load of over 2,@@ 7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will allow a competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , who is to guide the unity after the separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise is getting smaller and more focused than it &apos;s HP today and we have a broad and deep@@ en portfolio of stores that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion US annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on the deployment so far @-@ oriented innovative technology solutions for companies , &quot; said an explanation of the company .
it was granted a company that was established in the 19@@ 30s by the gradu@@ ates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard in order to create electr@@ o @-@ plants and whose Pal@@ o Alto today one has called &quot; the birth@@ place of the Sili@@ con Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring to get the turn of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturers and one of the biggest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area that is based on the belief that closely focused companies perform a better performance .
FC Arsenal Kap@@ itä@@ n Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates just must face the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
turning pointed out to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and provided his rehabilitation after plan is there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , its participation in the next summer is certainly still un@@ certain .
the great shame of this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had completed the last season after a separate k@@ est@@ y injury , and then returned to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury is not threatening the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone , who is not well cur@@ ved .
it is not a major issue .
that was just an accident .
it was not in contact with its buttons or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true of purely medical view , but as does not recognized , there is the per@@ tin@@ ent danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an uncomfortable pattern .
the study conducted by Premier In@@ ju@@ ries Ltd is sold in 23 different diseases from Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Arsen@@ than 157 league games , over the last five seasons .
the broader image for arsen@@ al is that they have been in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League Club who have recorded the most viol@@ ability .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a v@@ icious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the viol@@ ation rate during the last season will last .
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a random period , a time when you strengthen your body and win combat force , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zed , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
arsen@@ al begins his Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and towards Tot@@ t@@ enh@@ am Hot@@ sp@@ ur the coming Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns out into an rotation within the team .
Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not traveled to Croatia , which means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should be started .
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of E@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give players who need it to give a little break @-@ off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
though arsen@@ al clear are favor@@ ites by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Sta@@ dion in Zagreb belongs to the slots with the largest inti@@ mid@@ ation in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ be@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; in@@ vin@@ ci@@ ble &quot; campaign was started during the last season .
the stadium was sh@@ attered around the Tuesday evening by an earthquake , where the Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3,@@ 7 were measured .
this year it was the 10th place in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that arsen@@ al drew from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco and remains of the distant hope to bring the association to his first European ap@@ oc@@ al tri@@ umph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is imm@@ en@@ sely , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never folded in arsen@@ al .
we were in 2006 very close to it , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not a dre@@ amer .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show that has given us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for males to open themselves , now even dou@@ bt@@ ful than ever has ever become as self ass@@ ass@@ ad@@ ders among young men on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 it was the most important death of deaths among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ Health ( Cal@@ m - campaign against an inher@@ ited life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of putting the culture into question , the men hin@@ ders it to seek help when they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to tackle this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms discovered that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthier mood , &quot; its chances for recovery .
for those who are not pressed , hal@@ ved a circle of mentally healthy friends the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends to work with a friendship .
in the age of more than social media , communications , with their emphasis on substance on substance is the in@@ medi@@ ability of the response often more important than a significant contact .
our digital life have the need to be strong , life @-@ fun and successful , even when in reality the isolation are dominated .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what Psych@@ ologist extr@@ insi@@ c values call ; money , image , social status , everything at the cost intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper .
and as a video game @-@ invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently stated , money can really not buy .
the beauty of friends was that this foc@@ uss@@ ing on the head was placed .
each character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality , g@@ lit@@ tering through the interaction as friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler of the big hu@@ gs , moments of football in cozy chairs , and the longing for Ross after Rachel - all this came out of knowing that men can relate to it , even though they often with@@ hold back to explore completely their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like an employee of the phone call , I explained : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; my hear@@ ers for people that are de@@ pressed and put in danger , showed me really clearly how even the smallest interactions between friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us is often not able to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I com@@ m with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect on how the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if you talk about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term labour mechanisms .
it presents very clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone reaches the people in moments of des@@ per@@ ation also may help the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you come to this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day totally re@@ designing the backdrop , why do not take your friends to have a drink at Central Per@@ k .
or even better , if you &apos;re in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone can sit all alone , give it a smile and say Hi .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent at Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the whole 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PSG , Malm@@ ö to break@@ down
angel Di Maria celeb@@ rates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani to his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps cure to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game and response to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course , when Paris Saint @-@ Germain launched its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prince &apos;s stadium of Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League to put down the French master on the way , but afterwards she missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their prot@@ ru@@ sion when Cav@@ ani sco@@ red a head@@ ballo@@ on in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also needed a strong start against the Swedish master , as they are not only stri@@ ving for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the road to the quarters in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was no real class of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ him@@ ov@@ ics missed opportunity in front of the gate . he later started in the game against his native team and against the association , with which he began his illustr@@ ates her career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or other way in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to cause 2 : 0 to cause our opponents problems and relaxed back , even if there are certain things we need to perf@@ ected over the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won , although I regret we have not yet sco@@ red one or two more goals . &quot;
I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic returned to the Paris team following his injury to the Paris team , which was decided on the weekend 2 : 2 Un@@ decided to hold its own place to Bordeaux in the first League , but was taken off in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argentin@@ ean refugees who was then referred to as the man who took over to the next stage in Europe when he took over from Manchester United in the last month before he finished in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind Malm@@ ö @-@ defence before he finished in Johan Wil@@ and , past the long corner of the network .
but if someone felt that PSG would win a great win , that was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , that struck the Celtic in a play @-@ off in order to reach this level , joined the field at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national chess players on the field and was opened with a five @-@ man @-@ defense and two deep in the middle ground with severe opponents .
but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola Dj@@ ur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passing far along the Kevin Tr@@ p P@@ fo@@ sten in the 34@@ th minute , they put little in the attack .
instead , there were at times sometimes on , with some mis@@ ses and poor performance , not least from I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , who was scr@@ at@@ ched on no less than five being alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless he took a lot more skill , when he brought his fellow players to the game , and it was a pass of I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , turned to the Di Maria in a shooting , which was cut down by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole .
the second gate finally fell short after the hour brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Uruguay sco@@ red his sixth seed , after I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic was well ann@@ ed by Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö can return to the game , and just an outstanding view from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to stop the end result before Su@@ cc@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi arranged a gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ eide , was later on that PSG has played a class over his team and the Norwegian said , &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December last year .
since then we played only in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level .
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
check out in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca ste@@ eper X@@ avi , now that he was already standing in front of the arrival from Barcelona .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you told me that Bar@@ ça would like to sell me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Madrid , at that time , we did nothing , &quot; he says nothing , &quot; he says .
and this registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the memory : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not inter@@ change
but the change did not come about .
and the em@@ be@@ zz@@ ing man today is working for the German record company : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi declared why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has put under contract by gu@@ ardi@@ ola and I have played a great EM . &quot;
&quot; PE@@ P has said to me that I would not change that he could not imagine the crew without me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in that way he has cool@@ ed me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone knows how Bay@@ erns &apos;s Play@@ time 2008 / 2009 with X@@ avi were running .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ finals of the Champions League against the Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn , made the reds of ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated at the end the king @-@ ke@@ e@@ ers tri@@ umph .
Matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film movies
Matt Dam@@ on confront@@ ational the af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ican film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the variety and said , she won &apos;t be needed behind the scenes .
while a result of the Sunday night of H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light left the experienced actor Brown , as this stressed the need for alternative perspectives and indeed with regard to a black prot@@ agonist in the selected screen@@ play of the project .
&quot; when we talk about diversity , then you do it in the cast of the film and not in filling the show , &quot; in@@ sured Dam@@ on . &quot;
brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked , with venti@@ l@@ ated un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! Wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the act@@ ress of The Mar@@ tian took .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the Produ@@ zent@@ enk@@ ol@@ lie Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss about the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to call people to think about it - who@@ ever will be the director - how she treat the figure of harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown initially . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a wh@@ ore , be@@ aten by her white girl .
the producer of De@@ ar White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the direction of director &apos;s rights to the film ; Dam@@ on resi@@ sted that their director of &quot; could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ des dispro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate about Dam@@ on comments .
Twitter @-@ User Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip that he wrote &quot; Matt Dam@@ on speaks about the only black person in the room so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO O@@ ak that it hurt him . &quot;
the twe@@ et has served more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on comments come at a time when the precise racial ri@@ cian in the media is at the hel@@ m of the social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown has been killed by a white polic@@ emen , the movement was recorded by Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Ab@@ es@@ est@@ ed and urged law@@ makers and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against color .
in February the singer was made Prince Prince on the movement during the introduction of the nominal albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album still Mat@@ ter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
how books and black life , they still have their meaning .
more recently , leader of the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter will have published a statement in response to the question of the Fox @-@ News @-@ personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love @-@ group , &quot; said the guides .
recently , Dam@@ on was announced on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le , who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss about the representation of the Catholic Church in the west .

&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja W@@ arri@@ or &apos;s First Champion
professional sport climb@@ s and operating assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first ath@@ l@@ ete which won the American Nin@@ ja W@@ arri@@ or on Monday evening and took the Grand Prix of 1 million $ .
the competition show , which was completed just off their 7th season , had never experienced a contest , who was able to complete all levels of his obstacle course .
during the season , there are two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , until the final .
the last task was to climb to a 75 minute distributor in 30 seconds .
B@@ ritten ended the task of the first ath@@ l@@ ete to completed the stren@@ uous phase 4 by American Nin@@ ja W@@ arri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! messages after the hard cont@@ est@@ ed victory , still under shock above the prize of the Great Award of 1 million $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it is amazing to think about it , I never had anything more than 10,000 $ or a life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! over his he@@ ap money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as suddenly .. as I can not even imagine how that is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Rep@@ orter to discuss the finale and why B@@ ritten , although he was the first to obtain par@@ cours , not some prize money .
after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , one receives the one with the quick@@ est time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
how much the money is a wonderful price and life changed , he receives the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t believe he was holding some Gro@@ ll on that .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received the crow@@ ds of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a grandfather .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; if I should be be@@ aten by someone , I am glad there is Isaac . &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt just as if they were crus@@ hed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja W@@ arri@@ or was renewed for a stop@@ per season , the fil@@ ming will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers gr@@ inding to Min@@ nes@@ ota T@@ wins successfully
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OLI@@ S@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in the Bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers stand at the final place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as Spo@@ iler , however , gave this part in the Tuesday perfect against Min@@ nes@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target Field .
the T@@ wins have sp@@ ed a chance to climb in a game of Houston , Ast@@ ros for the second American League of Wild@@ card .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word which was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all vic@@ tories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad S@@ mus .
Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon gave his early offensive support , regarded as Detroit three times in the first two inside , then once in the sixth and then once in the ne@@ on .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) suggested 6 times in 1 / 3 inside and allowed three r@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his final nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year , &quot; said Simon .
it &apos;s hard to throw in the Bull@@ pen every game and therefore I want to focus entirely in the game .
the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had found three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since the middle of August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since then he had four hits at Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; he did well p@@ itted the stroke , &quot; said S@@ cis@@ s@@ m .
he looked good at ( drums ) , looked much better in the front @-@ pen , and he put it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the rear , at the end of the seventh inside , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back into the game again .
centre Fiel@@ d@@ B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double in the left @-@ line @-@ line .
Right Fiel@@ ding of Aaron H@@ icks reached a p@@ unt and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier for Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran wall , the only man who was faced with whom he was faced , before the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ Schlag@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , who was created a two @-@ run ren@@ dering .
with a pair of run@@ ners and the finishing in the second , he brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
in the Major League this season it was awarded for the leading third time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe suggested a double play@@ back
after Detroit was added at the end of the ninth Inn@@ ings a Insurance Run , a R@@ BI Double against the C@@ loser der Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and recorded the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed seals are S@@ ano with three pitches for the fifth time .
Detroit prof@@ ited for the pre@@ l@@ ude of the game by an even im@@ movable Phil Hu@@ ghes .
the tig@@ ers achieved three of us in the first two inside against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who was removed before the game from the inju@@ red list after having been missing for a back over a month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , not the beginning I desired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ ghes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I feel more confident when I was rele@@ asing and sens@@ ed that I would make some pretty good pitches in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ters , Hus@@ hes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z led by Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to the game , who made a single &quot; up the Middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z made its 0 @-@ 21 track series with Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right hand , made another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , which ended the threat .
the tig@@ ers placed in the second , sco@@ red a one @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single of Center @-@ Fields of Anthony G@@ ose on 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not have very well be@@ aten , but he did get the right place .
Hu@@ ghes was in a pitch size , sco@@ red no points in the third inning , before he was replaced by the Rel@@ ief Tre@@ aties A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ ghes , there came to 3 edges at six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ chez said because of a violation of the throw @-@ school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the Sh@@ ani of San@@ chez in 2007 .

hundreds of refugees to register in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people listed in Wiesbaden is to be accommod@@ ated in emergency accommodation in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden in the evening meal .
it is based on 450 up to 750 in@@ coming refugees .
several sports of the Asi@@ atic state capital was prepared for this case over the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can be temporarily out there .
they should then be spread further on other municipalities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alone in the past ten days , according to information provided by the former ruling speaker G@@ ießen , had arrived at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ ießen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an Option
the director of the Mün@@ chner Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a chance .
&quot; I think that re@@ are@@ well over military action options should not take place without Germany , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he thre@@ w the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago one was glad that the cup of military involvement in Germany was squ@@ ander@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the conflict att@@ ends our front door , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German Ambassador in Washington also called for a massive re@@ lu@@ ding international aid to the refugees .
Austria controls to southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria has once again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian conductor Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained the evening evening in the Austrian television station OR@@ F , to Hungary will no one go back now .
Germany did not send refugees to Austria for Germany too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
regarding the question of an agreement , which Germany could take up a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said , I have already been able to talk about the Director@@ ate General for Public Safety and representatives in this regard .
concrete figures called them not and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
tens of thousands of refugees reached the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ ers from Hungary to Austria in recent days .
your goal is mostly Germany .
ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states have so far not been able to agree on common action in the crisis .
the EU &apos;s interior ministers want to take a new attempt at a special transfer to the binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
given the strong refugee side in Germany , the federal government wants to support the federal states for the initial intake and distribution of people .
the federal government will jointly con@@ form this with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Minister at the emb@@ assy in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined , those humans , the protection bre@@ wers , be@@ ate this too .
who@@ ever does not have a lead perspective cannot remain in Germany too .
this idea was sufficiently shared in the round .
the ch@@ anc@@ ellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge power of force . &quot;
thousands of refugees spend thousands of refugees now stuck on the Bal@@ kan@@ route .
Hungary had its length of border to Serbia on the night on Tuesday .
a few hours on this occasion the government announced in Budapest but also to dismant@@ le the border with Romania with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wants to avoid that sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers sear@@ ched over Romania , &quot; said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to to the planned new Gren@@ zz@@ aun .
the Romanian government condemned the plan immediately .
there were first ar@@ rests of people that had gone through the fence .
in Turkey , meanwhile , thousands of migrants were reported on the way to the Greek border .

after ant@@ ech@@ ing on Thursday morning , we crossed a distinctive Kalt@@ front , the powerful rain falls , Wind@@ bows and a temperature @-@ back retrospec@@ tion .
like met@@ e@@ o@@ News in a communication , Switzerland is currently under the front of an extensive low@@ land area on the British islands in a powerful south @-@ west .
on the north @-@ north , the night is breaking through the valleys in the night .
as a result of the F@@ öh@@ n until Thursday morning , in the F@@ öhn@@ le valley with Bö@@ en from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land , partly also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öh@@ n can penet@@ rate into the ad@@ y@@ ines village , and on the mountains are even Or@@ can@@ ways from over 120 km / h possible .
while in the north on Wednesday turbul@@ ent caves for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees Fahr@@ enheit , the humidity begins at the Alp@@ ens@@ ü@@ red@@ hang .
here rain is one who continues until Thursday nights .
in sum , the Alps must be calculated in the next 48 hours with some 100 litres of rain per square meter , this has already enjoyed large quantities in the last days .
on Thursday morning the F@@ öh@@ n goes the air , in the episode rolls a cold front with strong , partly we@@ ed rain from west to east across Switzerland .

Rome has now a Martin Luther &apos;s Square
just under 500 years after the Re@@ formation , there is a Martin Luther &apos;s place in Rome .
in the presence of Stadt@@ prä@@ sident Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a previously released place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill is bapt@@ ised on the name of the German Reform@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now honoured to be honoured &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Re@@ formation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park lies in the middle of the old Rome , next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could often live only in hiding their faith .
with the place I become visible in a symbolic way that her tradition of Christian faith was welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) found himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the beginning of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the city back then as re@@ kind@@ red sinn@@ ers .
his negative impressions should also lead him to historians in his later fight against Rome .
Luther , then , had introduced with his Th@@ eses against the Ab@@ las@@ sh@@ andel the split of the Ab@@ onian Church .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( g@@ ild@@ ed ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main works of the Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and updated a Bible tex@@ te .
at the beginning was the Word ?
no , not in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now has been published with prominent images .
in the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has formulated his very personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of bi@@ blical story on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms have obtained the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : the respective subjects are adapted , which can quite seem quite ble@@ ak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; about three years joined the Ot@@ mar Alt in his Bible Project for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many them@@ atic areas of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book of all books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originated are cycles , which devote issues like cross @-@ du@@ g , pl@@ agues , command@@ ments or pat@@ ernity .
in this way , he has spont@@ ane@@ ously fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ publisher with his the@@ ological outlook as well as for the Kettler @-@ publishing house with his emphasis on art text@@ books .
and there is particularly the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who dealt with on the basis of painting with the respective Bible sites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt selected be@@ asts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to translate into current relationships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are as ver@@ bal mirror of Al@@ ts Pain@@ ting .
they have been embedded among the original Bi@@ as@@ z@@ itat by Martin Luther and one sentence of the artist who is here formulated his very personal thoughts about the particular situation .
the jewel @-@ band has golden letters .
so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , its emotions .
it is a high level of intimacy .
emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wern@@ iger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict protest@@ ant mist@@ n@@ hu@@ ter @-@ Medal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , the education already happened with the pel@@ stock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remember Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work hard to work with the Lord again , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to help the art back to more important times : &quot; the perception of picture wel@@ ten is now marked by re@@ kl@@ ame , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being pushed out .
artists have a different desire and glad@@ ness to show things .
images always have something myst@@ ical and are not decorative .
&quot; in that respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the spect@@ ator look at the pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let them seem to discover and feel what power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for its object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost arose on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bibel in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst has been to be : &quot; I like how he compreh@@ end with his images . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the images , the text explains only . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from the Luther @-@ editor , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;

DF@@ B intensified commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga continues again a clear sign in the weekend .
the soccer respon@@ ds to the sp@@ itz@@ able situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help with how to cope with the upcoming problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this for the greatest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t work for me , I have nothing to do with that . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has to be interested every individual to get this topic under control , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B head , Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday at the emb@@ assy and meet there the Minister of President Mrs. Ma@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will certainly play a central role &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football could and wants to help .
but the decisive ordination has to place the policy .
the German soccer association has therefore expanded its refugee &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; about the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun foundation , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; explained K@@ id@@ s@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some German li@@ gi@@ sts support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already this weekend , the 36 Profi@@ por@@ k lists a clear sign when they are on the left tri@@ ck@@ er instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logos ( her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We will help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said goodbye , Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and signed the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ understand@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee @-@ drama goes every one , no one can see . &quot;
&quot; we can benefit football , no , we have to use our radi@@ otherapy , to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly many , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
Hoff@@ enh@@ ei@@ ms Managing Director Peter ret@@ t spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot;
zum EM @-@ Quali@@ fication Game against Hungary at this Friday invites the national team of women 100 refugees to Halle / Saale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ id@@ s@@ bach outlines the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large joint work in German football &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 licens@@ ing have had their own projects in their places would be great .
just as great is that small and smallest acc@@ ents are active .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we spent , is spent in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
this year , the association will jointly contribute to funding for the integration of refugees with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the associations have already been called for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported kidney s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP @-@ St@@ amps lose an eye on an event
the leader of Europe &apos;s biggest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost several reports , according to a fall at the beginning of July the left eye was lost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the accident at the stair@@ way in the house of his brother in the USA he fell to a water @-@ glass under midnight , that he carried in the left hand , report the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economic week &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he is almost destroyed , was f@@ ain@@ ted , then went out to tow@@ ed out onto the road - that he told us last week , &quot; quot@@ ed the &quot; Wi@@ Wo@@ &quot; SAP @-@ Co @-@ founder of Has@@ so Plat@@ ner .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could take his job done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beginning of October we meet before the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sass@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old manager is at the meeting and &quot; fully &quot; &quot; labour @-@ capable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to conduct the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am fully there for SAP , full of my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course , I was all the time in regular contact with the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Plat@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; SZ . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the U.S. , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP Head@@ quarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal history as the manager of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SZ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen so something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to get up again if you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

football : Bv@@ B without re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller im Tor
at Bor@@ ussia Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback can be met by Marco re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League .
the National players will also be missing the leader of the Bundes@@ liga even in the Du@@ ell with the F@@ K Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 . / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot draw on him unfortunately , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ deck against Leverkusen , the BV@@ B @-@ coach was open again : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high burden of his professionals , Tu@@ chel will change his trunk c@@ eleven not only on the re@@ us position .
so he announced a change on the door@@ ke@@ eper position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller assumes the place from stem D@@ eper Roman Bür@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; praised the football @-@ teacher the world champion .
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ ters is used in future in all Europe league games , Tu@@ chel has however been open .
with a high probability he will also ride the second game .
the for@@ sche statement of te@@ amm@@ ers re@@ us that the final decision for the BV@@ B in the Europe league will be the target , holds mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for trac@@ e@@ worthy : &quot; so Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to access the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government aims at the cutting edge for Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany shall be fron@@ tr@@ un@@ ner after the will of the federal government in the change of cars &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bundes@@ kab@@ in@@ ett decided on Wednesday a Strateg@@ i@@ ep@@ ap@@ ee of the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobr@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dobr@@ ind@@ t said on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of Autom@@ esse I@@ AA from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new home age &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
automated , connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; said Dobr@@ ind@@ t .
he wants to discuss the topic with his counter@@ part from the G@@ 7 states which come together with representatives of the industry at the I@@ AA .
among other things , the Strateg@@ ic Ministry of Technology , among other things empha@@ sizes the importance of the mobile broad@@ band building and a high level of breeding on digital audi@@ ot@@ el@@ ds .
a testing of new technique is currently being created at the motorway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to allow the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where needed to adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany , for instance , Germany plans to use internationally for ensuring the permitted maximum speed for self @-@ driving cars raised by 10 to 130 hours per hour .
the German government also wants to apply to a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only seen the human being as a driver .
by autom@@ ating driving , the car takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in sec@@ rec@@ y .
as a result of an economic study laid out by the Economy Ministry , it is possible to provide highly automated driving on motor@@ ways to 2020 technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the vehicles on public roads are to be expected very far to 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added value in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the site of Germany appreciate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital network of the P@@ KW@@ s can lead to improved safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD @-@ Transport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; swe@@ ar Bar@@ to@@ l &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the liability of liability in accidents and security of personal data of the drivers must be clear either .
still the German self @-@ driving cars are sc@@ ep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey on Wednesday at the AA presented survey of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the exam@@ in@@ gan@@ isation dec@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonom@@ ous cars will be en@@ forced in the next ten years , 32 percent are not reck@@ oned in 20 years , 31 per cent believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed until 20@@ 25 with self @-@ sufficient cars , in the US 33 percent .
anyway , the drivers in Germany are not ready to rely entirely on a self @-@ driving vehicle .
according to a survey of the latest Bit@@ kom , only seven percent will support , taking control during the entire trip on all roads .
on the highway it could be unusual in flowing transport after 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
well every v@@ ated would have left the car to control under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team@@ - and double @-@ start at Tis@@ cht@@ en@@ nis @-@ EM
the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer wants to settle for jet@@ ties between 25 September and 4 October only in the single .
the final decision will be handed down at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough , even without Timo to get the title &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Bundest@@ ags Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ neck during the EM @-@ apprentic@@ eship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ oll was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor for sponsor@@ ship in China .
the 34 year old German master is expected on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo , the down@@ side , we are no longer so a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained @-@ Europ@@ am@@ eister Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who runs the S@@ etz@@ ee in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , but also reminded of the EM@@ V in Romania .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , Timo has also been missing and we have become European Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by doing so , we should base our world @-@ tran@@ si@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an end y
it is a mixture of very large Mo@@ den@@ schau and a Wach@@ s@@ fig@@ uren Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : DIS@@ PLAY MANNEQUINS , which are app@@ alling thanks to Video@@ proj@@ ections .
they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who was among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as Büh@@ nen@@ out@@ fits to the great star of Mo@@ des@@ ks - and with it that he tasted men in skirts .
&quot; I can no longer say today that I am the En@@ f@@ ant y of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier it was very easy , now it is genuine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( V@@ om flo@@ or@@ walk on the cat@@ walk ) , which is seen from September 18 at the Kuns@@ thalle of HY@@ PO @-@ Kulturstiftung , it is a bit of luck that the Mo@@ des@@ ch@@ iv@@ ot has changed its beginning to look at a show on his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he had been on the other hand , for : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me sound was a little bit after death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , one gets into the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful d@@ resses , &quot; said the director of Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en .
it go to tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the man &apos;s barely ever @-@ looking work of the man , who has written the mo@@ de@@ an , without ever having an education .
chron@@ ologically is the show not constructed , but it is a great chore@@ ographic work that was done for so much effort : to fr@@ ise the d@@ olls , was developed to become a sty@@ list .
14 tons of material have borne out the movers according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot in Munich .
shortly before the start of the October party , there was a special di@@ man@@ ker : a leather out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
he always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men ) and for people who are a bit different , the Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
also Gau@@ l@@ ti@@ ers alter Ted@@ dy is in the exhibition to see .
he stands for the first , tender mo@@ an object of design .
as a child ( he was not a good student and po@@ or@@ ly in the football ) he was attracted by his Ted@@ dy Bear and d@@ resses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
playing with a pupp@@ et , his parents would not have allowed him .
he did not throw the mode of fashion he later brought itself to itself .
he prescribed fashion periods and looked at the dra@@ fts of other designers , such as Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought it but of course .
for his first own fashion show , he did not pay the mod@@ els .
they got nothing but were allowed to keep the cl@@ ots .
jewellery instead of be@@ ard@@ ine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze als fashion @-@ N@@ ische
previously it went to the long embro@@ ider@@ y machinery in and around lo@@ wer@@ sting to make meters .
the embro@@ i@@ dered substances and points emerged in large amount for customers , which they worked for example on blan@@ kets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work today , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of Mo@@ j@@ ad@@ j@@ okes .
instead the mode is important again .
in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze @-@ Tour , fashion played a major role , was then pushed out by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : head in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and at regional tr@@ ams .
ever bil@@ de the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which re@@ jects talks on past styles , an increasing customer potential .
who@@ ever has no ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer in the market .
with us , they already have half of all orders .
Mo@@ entr@@ ust Pl@@ auen is a member of nine other companies member of the branch association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ ider@@ ies .
only they are allowed to carry the protected label .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last 15 years some 80 percent of the sales were cut off . &quot; &quot; &quot;
private business and also the wholes@@ ale are almost no more .
our products are hardly possible to reach the customer on this way .
the mass goods these days are manufactured in the Asian region a lot cheaper and almost exclusively distributed over chains .
moreover , the export of export is to be currently in Russia and the USA .
there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also attempts through environmental awareness as Cord@@ ula Bauer ac@@ ul@@ ted by the nit@@ rogen in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since this year we are leading a seal of quality that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is also applied to the materials used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thesis by Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eberger out@@ stelle der West@@ s@@ äch@@ s@@ isches Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alizes in embro@@ ider@@ ies and summits .
in order to be counter@@ posed to the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies that need to think especially economically , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , an existing design often makes it easy to keep a customer base .
a few years ago , textile design @-@ design@@ ate Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter is the historical snow @-@ tip new .
then sends the machine to some places small pots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ schm@@ ie@@ de@@ gem in Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ gen allowed themselves to be inspired : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could not start with traditional pl@@ au@@ ener tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow @-@ tip for their jewelry .
in a consuming practice they shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the subject of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter .
it also supplies the USA , to Australia and to Finland - mainly to clients whose ancestors had lived in Pl@@ auen and surroundings and who would like a souvenir .
with this I see my jewelry as a modern amb@@ assador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not about a new film , but a kind of continuation that is about 20 years after the first film with the magic children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about the experience of the N@@ anny and the family Banks in times of the World economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years according to Julie Andre@@ ws is still un@@ clear .

XI is ur@@ ging the economy to open the wider world
the economy must open up wider outside to promote growth , President Xin@@ Jin@@ ping on the Tuesday of a group that was charged with the ste@@ ering of the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should ap@@ point to apply foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business meetings , &quot; he said in an address at the 16th session of the Central Security Group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
encourage new start @-@ ups and advance reforms will bring new momentum and vitality , and bring new space for economic growth , said Xi .
the leadership group has adopted a set of guidelines , including a neg@@ ativity list to the regulation of the market , relaxation of border controls , to include government organisations ( SO@@ E ) , priv@@ ates Capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the inhabitants @-@ of @-@ system .
after the statement , a negative list will be identified , the sectors and businesses identified for investments don &apos;t come into question .
the system will gradually be tested and improved by testing programs .
the initiative is of importance since it as@@ cribed to the market a bigger role in the release of natural resources , a legally state business environment and designed the market in open manner , said the Statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also take control of the powers transferred to the company and ensure that companies will decide how to manage their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China &apos;s border areas will allow emerging new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer , state @-@ controlled sectors to open , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign companies and bring better services to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it will be easier for foreigners , a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for you to apply the requirements and facilit@@ ating the evaluation process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law of lawyers , to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting were reported Premier Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important guides such as Li@@ u Yun@@ nan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as was reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mer@@ cury bound@@ ary in prey
the European Commission plans to double the thres@@ hold for mer@@ cury in large car@@ ni@@ ers and consumers a significantly higher dose of the nerve .
the consumer organization Food@@ watch , which is an attractive work of the EU , critic@@ ized the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed and inf@@ ants are passed on with full swe@@ ar to pregnant and inf@@ ants , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch .
Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the bor@@ der@@ ers of the nerve po@@ ison@@ ous should be attached to large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , from one to two milli@@ gram mer@@ cury according to kil@@ ogra@@ m fish .
big car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res were sil@@ enced , but already today so strongly stra@@ ined with mer@@ cury , that on the basis of the current limit values , about 50 percent of the cat@@ ches are not sold .
after dou@@ bling of the thres@@ hold , only 14.@@ 5 percent would have been negoti@@ able .
in return for this attrac@@ ting , the EU according to Food@@ watch wants to tigh@@ ten the bor@@ der@@ ings with other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ gram to 0.1 milli@@ gram of Mercury per kil@@ ogra@@ m .
Food@@ watch recorded this but &quot; trick &quot; because smaller pat@@ ches , such as car@@ p are usually so low charged , that they already keep the planned maximum value today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ab@@ dic@@ ation at Kl@@ einf@@ o was therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ des &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which helps alone the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
