the two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement as well as in Teheran &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
but at the meeting there is also a struggle with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ states solution .
the relationship between Obama and Netany@@ ahu has been stra@@ ined for years .
Washington is critic@@ ized the continuous settlements of Israel and e@@ jects a Netany@@ ahu at the peace process in the peace process .
by the Obama appointed &apos;s deal with Iran &apos;s nuclear programme , the relationship of the two has deteri@@ or@@ ated further .
in March , Netany@@ ahu had held an invitation of the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans before the US Congress held a controversial speech which was held partly as the aff@@ ront to Obama .

in a Not@@ ruf Professor , his friend were shot
in a Not@@ ruf Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb with a somewhat fier@@ y voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
Lamb was important to empha@@ size that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but I live and probably was excited , and he said the family @-@ size of dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
within the house , the officials took the Lei@@ che of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a hand @-@ driven note that I wanted to do it , I loved it , I loved it , I loved it &apos; . this stood according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who was deployed in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ veland , Mississippi , signed up to 300 miles on the school premises , where he moved to the police a popular quad@@ rup@@ ture , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office and killed .
Delta State University Poli@@ tho@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that Univers@@ ität@@ &apos;s employees heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb made the fool@@ ish st@@ ir sometime after that .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life , when the police took him up .
a day after the shooting at the university , the students and teachers are forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what &apos;s motiv@@ ating .
the details published by the investig@@ ators on both ends of the State , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped him to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers .
students said that they were looking for his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ ent@@ iss died , he did not have history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history .
Schmidt itself had mentioned a written book in one of his written book , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
they made them working in the Department of Social Sciences and history whose fac@@ ulty has 17 members , and many students visited classes of both .
at the same time there were some incl@@ ine to problematic behavior patterns .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ avers , the Lamb praised , he also seemed a little excited and ed@@ gy when something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes said that he told him that he had said to do at the end of 2014 @-@ 15 with stress .
Lamb previously had asked the Delta State University to ask a Be@@ ur@@ lau@@ ction for health reasons and said that he had some health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the employment policy of the university signi@@ fied that the promotion had worked so hard for the Lamb that would represent no guarantee for an automatic way of working as Assistant @-@ Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Univers@@ ität@@ ts @-@ President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said , he did not know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions , the Lamb is no longer able to answer .
after the flight from the campus the police found later Lam@@ bs tracks as he returned to Mississippi from Ark@@ ans@@ as .
before it could be arrested , k@@ issed himself self with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the rear of a house about a mile south of his home country on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grown in the area .
Lamb started 2009 his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,@@ 000 inhabitants , and taught Ge@@ ography and Päd@@ ago@@ gi@@ k .
he prov@@ oking the spring in Päd@@ ago@@ gi@@ k .
one of the long @-@ standing friend@@ inside lamin@@ ates drew him as an intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Carla Rain@@ ston said , she was 15 and lam@@ b was 20 when they met together through joint friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool old guy who tried a couple of years trying to teach her guitar playing .
he was then at the time of women &apos;s black .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all girls d@@ ressed when he was &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson suburbs of Bran@@ don . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss were obviously a couple of time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I put my wife killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the oven house that is adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ent@@ iss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were left 15 years ago , but friends had stayed and a daughter that was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was totally destroyed in the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely the best friends .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and blues playing .
Lamb met Pr@@ ent@@ iss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came up three years ago both on a summer @-@ year market .
later they played together to one or another .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and performing her own music .
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was a nur@@ se , which worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ ke@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lighted bar near the Gau@@ tier , told him Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss Night in the night 5th September for the last time saw his guitar and mouth harmon@@ ic play ended in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no indication that anything un@@ anim@@ ous .
&quot; just a lucky pair , &quot; he said .
we were on the au@@ fr@@ aming and j@@ oking with each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of us@@ ement .
Schmidt , the dead professor , headed the first semester seminar and specialized in American native inhabitants and colonial history , Don All@@ an Mitchell , an English @-@ professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as , President of his Br@@ otherhood , and of the students .

UN @-@ Chief says , there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General of Ban Ki @-@ Moon says his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years of lasting conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of men .
the UN Chef calls for all parties , including the UN Security Council , to unite and Integ@@ rative negotiations on the final of a political solution .
Ban said a press conference held on Wednesday that he is planning to discuss the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the Assembly of the General Assembly even this month in order to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ ts that the re@@ moves in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this situation cannot be solved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ban demanded for five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity during the crisis in Syria , which have demonstrated it with Iran in achieving a nuclear issue .
8 Def@@ lec@@ tions values demonstrate that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious to take seriously .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a break .
but no matter how some Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans attempt to drag Donald tr@@ ump from the upper ranks to pol@@ ls at the bottom , it has ( yet ) not working .
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ dig@@ it area , and some begin to wonder what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ation of the estate Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course it is too early in the election period .
no claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nomin@@ ation .
experts empha@@ size that by Rick Per@@ r@@ ys was given up by Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership in the rising Herman C@@ ain , none of whom ever won a state in the nomin@@ ation process .
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but outside groups like Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group club for Growth will now recognize Tr@@ umps per@@ sever@@ ance and begin to let their dollar flow to overthrow him .
here are some current surveys , which suggest that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
stret@@ cher &apos;s assets have turned around 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy mid June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two out of ten rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans saw the estate @-@ mo@@ gu@@ l .
until the middle of July it was 40 percent .
in the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now six out of 10 Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
some three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures consider themselves in early States .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has established last week that 60 percent of the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of dump .
two third of the GO@@ P voters GO@@ P would be happy with tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , they would be either &quot; delighted &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of them say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates roughly the same enthusiasm as tr@@ ump ( 43 per cent , they would be &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if everyone would Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate .
a majority of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans see trace temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for its bom@@ b@@ astic and bel@@ ei@@ ving statements , 52 percent of the Republi@@ can country Irish voters believe that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first temporary state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a com@@ mander @-@ in @-@ over , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent , that he did not have the personality to execute effectively his office , and almost six out of 10 Independent say that his temper@@ ament not into the White House p@@ asse , so ABC / post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if they dis@@ continue her scholar@@ ship , maintain Republi@@ can voters Tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked who win the GO@@ P nomin@@ ation after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C , last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
that &apos;s a change since the time when four out of ten end of July put its money out on Je@@ b Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters in the past did not cover the crystal ball .
at this point in the last cycle four of ten rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nomin@@ ation only 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P elec@@ tors will look into plau@@ sible campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around a different candidate , Tr@@ ump will turn almost everyone .
some experts suggest that the frag@@ mented field probably join too m@@ umps while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates diff@@ uses .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University beginning of September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical mind @-@ at @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , tr@@ ump supports multiple support .
he did before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points u@@ pl@@ unge , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before edge Paul , John Ka@@ himself and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who struck him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneurs with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical mind @-@ at @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald tr@@ ump @-@ fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters , the Tr@@ ump support , say that they have fixed their voices .
of course , a lot can happen to change this , and no one can truly say , never change the opinion .
46 percent said that they are open the door to move to other candidates .
nonetheless , Tr@@ umps strongest competition in the moment the other out@@ sider , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say they coinci@@ de with tr@@ ump at issue of immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign was taken two months ago immigrants from Mexico &quot; rape , &quot; the migration ful@@ fil@@ ming and ful@@ crum at public dis@@ course .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of prolifer@@ ate H@@ isp@@ ano @-@ Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can party and damaged the re @-@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / post survey of Monday , six out of 10 Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans that they agree with Tr@@ ump in issues of immigration .
so long as the immigration in the spot@@ light will remain , it will seem to be Donald Tr@@ ump as well .
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s to new levels .
at Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son meanwhile , around half of the support of Republi@@ can elec@@ tors , especially by their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they preferred to gain a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are also fu@@ ri@@ ous in Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three by four I@@ owa Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in the Congress with 54 percent . &quot; and 21 percent &quot; wooden ref@@ uses . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg trail is the most expensive residential area - with a view over the North Sea .
in the street is costs a square meter of a deer @-@ door in the average 7@@ 3.@@ 300 Euro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt the supply of objects is natur@@ alized , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study reveals in which particular g@@ ages will cost a square meter in the most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top live standards , one of the cost is like a Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the Real Estate Service Tool angel &amp; Völ@@ ker has released a ranking of the most exclusive German residential places - with square roll@@ ers in vibr@@ ating high places .
there are several ten thousand Euros - per square meter , well @-@ marked .
but good , who can &apos;t afford it ...
by the way : Munich is close not at the top here .
Champions League : Bayern @-@ Traum@@ start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
indisp@@ acher scor@@ er in Piraeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller just has a run .
a happ@@ ier hit by Thomas Müller headed the FC Bayern the way to a conden@@ ser 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pir@@ äus - then ran .
a sovereig@@ n bu@@ l@@ ude of Champions League @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have created a dream start to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Milan in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of Trainer PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola did her launch l@@ ude in the Champions League at the Greek recru@@ iting master Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to tr@@ ash double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es Hits ( 8@@ 9 ) deserves to 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th company success in series will be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich .
Müller received at his 28th hit in the Champions League for the Bavaria tour of gü@@ ed Mi@@ th@@ ilfe von Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who left one as an flan@@ k leg of the world cup .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; had Bayern Mar@@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ akis stadium promised before 3@@ 1.6@@ 88 hot fans . and the Mün@@ chner stopped word .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without sh@@ iny .
Pir@@ re@@ aus has won his recent six home games in the Royal class , including against well @-@ known clubs , such as Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
2011 proud here also Bor@@ ussia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up @-@ Du@@ els were defeated with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went to be cour@@ ageous , with their offensive efforts but often to be influenced by works .
the attacks was often initiated by play@@ back on Lin@@ ks@@ außen Douglas Costa , who was rarely en@@ ched against the former Braunschweig Om@@ ar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ella@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had struck more luck from right than his f@@ ake from the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
initially , as the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ storms , Brown the he@@ ball of the Poland struck by the line ( 26 . ) .
then by reading , the go@@ al@@ location Roberto with the knee par@@ ched ( 35@@ . ) .
although Bavaria are used to have been used in an am@@ antes game , Piraeus was able to re@@ lie@@ ve nuts .
but on door@@ ke@@ e@@ pers , Manuel Neu@@ er was fi@@ red .
so , as he took a shot of ide@@ ye via the Lat@@ te l@@ enk@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of New Gu@@ ardi@@ ola , let Gu@@ ardi@@ ola had a four @-@ coat with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after mus@@ cular problems back in the Ka@@ der , sat first out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero gave a green light only after the final training , Mr S@@ ammer said at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to make something different from it , that &apos;s already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the first change Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sle@@ y Com@@ an for the Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) and he made 13 minutes later everything clear , passed by El@@ f@@ meter , Müller had a dr@@ on .
in front of the game it was in the stadium to Kra@@ w@@ alle .
after a smaller group of some contamin@@ ated Bavaria @-@ fans in their viewer @-@ block the fans of the hosts had prov@@ oked by words and ge@@ stu@@ res , took out the security forces and went with head@@ ings against the Mün@@ chner trailer .

who smok@@ es , has a higher risk to lose teeth
who smok@@ es , d@@ ressed thus not only the lungs , but also the teeth - that puts an Pots@@ dam@@ er Long study close .
the good news : the risk drops as quickly as possible .
smok@@ ers have a significantly increased risk to lose their teeth early .
this dates from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute of Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ sm@@ oker was the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely to lose the 2,5@@ - till 3.@@ 6 times higher .
the scientists had seen more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
root causes of tooth dec@@ ay be c@@ aries and inflammation of the fl@@ esh@@ y , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E .
for this peri@@ od@@ ont@@ itis , smoking is a risk factor , empha@@ size the authors .
the connection between smoking and dental loss tend to go back on frequent dental fl@@ esh@@ itis in sm@@ oker .
not clear , however , smoking also increases the risk to tooth dec@@ ay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped dealing with smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers are writing in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it can take over ten years until the threat goes back to the level of non @-@ sm@@ oker , the first au@@ tor Thomas Diet@@ rich declared by the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must persu@@ ade people persu@@ ade non @-@ smoking , stated study manager H@@ einer Boeing vom DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking short@@ ens the lifetime &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoke is good for lung and vessels and leads to our findings for good dental health until high age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of dental crowns , the DI@@ f@@ E divided .
previous investigations have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth dec@@ ay .
the new @-@ term study under@@ p@@ ate the findings .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings reveals that the EU states and the USA jointly select independent judges to a new investment Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries .
it is intended for the first time also a second instance .
it would allow it to raise against jud@@ g@@ ments .
so far , the proced@@ ural participated in each other on the refer@@ ee , a obj@@ ector against their jud@@ g@@ ments there was not .
in the discussion of the past months it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in matters relating to fairness and justice .
in the long term , it wants to work according to its own information on an International Investment Court .
for example , there could be any dispute between Chinese companies and the EU countries .
the investor @-@ oriented investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) were considered to be one of the main reasons for the large resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel , on the enterprise compens@@ ates for tax@@ pay@@ ers , national laws , or a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP @-@ organisations such as Camp@@ act included the proposals of the European Commission as insufficient .
critic@@ ised primarily that they should not apply to the free trade agreements with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German economic secret@@ ary of Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) outlines the plans on the other hand as a great progress .
the Commission considered the reform essential points , the German Minister of Agriculture Sig@@ mar Gabriel worked out in the spring with other EU Trade Department .
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als was from the table .
the French government welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European Business Association for Business Europe continued to restrict the clar@@ ification of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized companies could be dis@@ advant@@ aged , it says .
when the talks on the TTIP TTIP ( Tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded on Wednesday they remained un@@ clear .
the negotiations are run since the middle of 2013 .
the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the United States .
originally planned should be a framework for the agreement at the end of this year .
this date is considered to be no longer durable .
Del@@ ik@@ ater Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens sits on the stage in the Köl@@ ner Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
beside him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy pointed out the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan has been recorded with film sti@@ ft .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is virtually taken from Stev@@ ens Spe@@ ech .
he tells us using various places he keeps on the map again , wor@@ rying about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and tender songs .
where they were formed and how it looks like , in his homeland .
since then , Stev@@ ens proves to be wonderfully creative .
with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; appear smart songs , which vic@@ t@@ orious very close to American Folk of the late six@@ ties , but always dri@@ fting into great op@@ ul@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it arises the rum@@ or , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michigan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a cur@@ ved series : each of the 50 US states to be entered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , already in 2004 and the area already , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already been published and has positive certain expectations .
reduces Stev@@ ens here on .
live gen@@ ates him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musicians come back to the series in New York .
with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Illin@@ oise , ) published in 2005 an extensive celeb@@ rating master@@ piece .
Over@@ b@@ ord@@ ing to ideas and sty@@ li@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album goes into the American Bill@@ board charts and no annual report list of the influ@@ ential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to extremely productive experiments , Stev@@ ens serves him at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic head@@ pieces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth arranged studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but carried by programm@@ ed sequ@@ ences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and Hall .
long ago the smaller clubs finished , the sli@@ des@@ hows here will change to the colored spectac@@ le of ne@@ on @-@ forehead and big fluores@@ cent stages .
currently tour@@ t Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens as part of a five @-@ piece band through Germany .
in the dark @-@ held Hamburg More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; theatre he mainly presents this since March &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although here now nearly 2000 guests are sc@@ ann@@ ed in their chairs , the clearly sur@@ fer Stev@@ ens returned to intimacy and to the folk .
without putting a word to the audience , the group plays excellent musicians through the wide @-@ based album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the audience you hear : the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; op@@ ul@@ enter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can basically throw the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to a en@@ core is Stev@@ ens modest , does acoustic quite a few older songs and eventually runs under thunder@@ ous appl@@ ause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns Deb@@ üt at the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n debut at the issue of Prime Minister with tension expected
the new Labour Office of Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to give his debut in the Prime Minister to the Prime Minister and to apply for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will raise to place the first of its six pre @-@ defined questions shortly after mid@@ day , with its performance by the media most likely and the Labour MPs are tested nearby .
he called &quot; less theat@@ res and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he has also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s guidance , as it is after his appointment as a member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ et , and after his speech at the Tu@@ c Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour Party decision to pro@@ voke a commemor@@ ative ceremony to the 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence at a commemor@@ ative ceremony on the 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , and is at the center of several tit@@ ling stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national hy@@ m@@ ne has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in respectful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Luft@@ schl@@ acht &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told at the BBC Two News@@ night program , he got to sing the Labour Day , &quot; independent &quot; of his faith that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow @-@ minist@@ ries have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns excell@@ ency , and they refer to differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as leaders .
the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also within the Labour Party , &quot; and after Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns comments on the position of the European Union and the limit on the winn@@ ings .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the Tu@@ c Conference that Labour changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions Minister , that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against governmental plans , limiting the limitation of 26,@@ 000 £ to 23,@@ 000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the Fif@@ th Labour Chair with David Cameron since he has been T@@ ory Chef in the last decade to face the Dis@@ patch Box in the parliament .
the Labour Chair , who promised a different Commissioner , says that he has given &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to con@@ front the Prime Minister and that he has made both &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stroke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the fight with contradictions and instead made himself to focus on serious problems like poverty , inequality and challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , die Schatten econom@@ ist minist@@ ress will represent him , if he is not participating - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word and that he said John Ber@@ co@@ w , the speaker of the &apos; farmhouse , to discuss the problem .
when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron told him that he is linked by politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ Theatre &quot; who is often linked to the Prime Minister . but some years later he ad@@ mits that he failed .
since she was first sent on TV in 1990 on television , the question was considered as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment and his leadership in the Unter@@ haus and his position under his parliament@@ arians , although critics were argu@@ ed , she became a car@@ ic@@ ature , and imp@@ aired far @-@ reaching reforms .

Po@@ unds with acceler@@ ated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound increased dramatically after data that show a rise in wage growth in the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ BM@@ iller &apos;s goal .
between May and July the result grew without bonuses in the UK by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the same period .
this percentage was the fastest @-@ fastest ever since 2009 and brought in@@ estim@@ ations about the timing of a interest rate .
pounds rose by over 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 55@@ 05 and was climb@@ ed up to 40 % over the Euro to 1,@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index completed with an increase of 98 % to 6.@@ 22@@ 9,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after the acquisition of the R@@ ival AB In@@ Be@@ v was made .
one transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ ice @-@ shares were up@@ lifting messages from the competition Group for luxury goods Lev@@ em@@ ont 0,9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat out all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for bur@@ sa - growth mel@@ lowed .
shares of Glen@@ core came up by 5 % after the mining operation was said that he had 2.5 billion dollars by a public sale as part of his strategy of debt reduction .
the shares of the packaging and paper Group MON@@ DI were the largest los@@ ers on the index , namely by a decrease of 4.3 % , after the prospec@@ tus for the company Rating for &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3,@@ 1 % after the sport@@ swe@@ eping company had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 46.@@ 6 million .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages will compromise the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; more department could mean in the po@@ ckets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this buying power should be the higher labour costs at his company , he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added and this could mean there are less additional jobs there .

inspired by the Sp@@ ru@@ ch &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the PEG@@ I@@ DA movement , Al@@ h@@ ay potato and meat put together to a sphere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the idea he brought him a poster using a PEG@@ I@@ DA demonstration with the ins@@ cription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potatoes instead of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potatoes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which he had random@@ ly seen on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , in his store the barbecue which has been fitted with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is multic@@ ul@@ tural for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay .
the idea has become the Leb@@ Leb@@ anese in the meantime since the sponsor@@ ship in Munich .

how much meat and how much potatoes of the sp@@ ades , Al@@ h@@ ay does not want to betra@@ y it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only as much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Met@@ cash starts ground @-@ off campaign to fight al@@ di@@ - di@@ arr@@ he@@ a
Met@@ cash tries to protect Ig@@ A branches in front of an Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food @-@ wholes@@ alers Met@@ cash has started a stance @-@ up campaign to defend the market share of Ig@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of an 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di opens the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia start next year , Met@@ cash and Ig@@ A grocery stores their relationships with local food suppliers and rebuild the brand Ig@@ A by mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ aide @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A @-@ distributors and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , which are distributed in Ig@@ A @-@ stores samples and shop owners , who bought tickets for the South Australian soccer liga to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash has released more details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when wholes@@ alers surplus to food , alcohol and equipment passes its annual investor strategy .
there is much at stake , since South Australia and Western Australia have almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Ig@@ A cargo ju@@ ices and generate higher profits as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Ig@@ A network in the Eastern states .
single B@@ apt@@ ist in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ or@@ ically provincial capital and Ig@@ A retail@@ er have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 per cent in Eastern Europe .
however , anal@@ ysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley that Al@@ di twelve months after opening its first markets around five percent of the food market in these two states is eliminated and all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
one week published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath made from Morgan Stan@@ ley that Ig@@ A @-@ retailers 360 $ million sales per year and Met@@ cash could lose $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this progno@@ sis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di in the next year will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA and achieved a total turnover of 500 million $ and 600 million $ in each market .
the loss in the food and food shop and amounts to Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost @-@ based , Met@@ cash may cost roughly 13 million $ earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , met@@ cash market shares in the East @-@ states , mainly at Al@@ di and CO@@ LES , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that Ig@@ A @-@ smok@@ ers are the most accurate .
Morgan Stan@@ ley takes stock of met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in the food and food shop for 3.8 per cent in 2016 , by 4.@@ 1 percent in 2017 and 2,@@ 1 percent in 2015 to 2018 , and reduce the market share of 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , in a business eating in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash probably will disappear within a decade . met@@ cash disappear .
Met@@ cash refused to respond publicly on the comments made by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is understood that a member @-@ member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass has been in contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ As market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trading , which is about 1,@@ 200 Ig@@ A retailers since 2012 has fallen by 43 percent , reflec@@ ting the operating debt reduction in turnover and mar@@ gins .
the wholes@@ alers surplus value however and invest@@ s more than 150 million euros , to increase sales prices with CO@@ LES and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths of hundreds of products each week to improve the same and Ig@@ A retailers in improving their stores by fast growing fresh foods and deliver a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adap@@ tions and shop rehabilitation programs can be set with ver@@ ve and hopes that the wholes@@ alers will return in 2017 for the first time in four years back to a profit growth .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ k@@ akis is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Kok@@ k@@ akis deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ k@@ akis was one of the &quot; col@@ ater@@ al damages &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserves a praise of the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly , as a criti@@ que of his own behaviour .
Kok@@ si@@ akis , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is repeatedly referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s &quot; , made by the famous alleg@@ ations of Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ inka on the Montreal Masters in the spot@@ light .
in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that , Kok@@ k@@ akis , and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison was separated twice through the arbit@@ er , with Har@@ rison who had to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z and I should propose the child . &quot;
while he was recently seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis r@@ acket after a battle failed to def@@ use a potential US Open @-@ victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ k@@ akis was def@@ le@@ ased by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ go@@ w , competing with Sam Groth at the second place in the One behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup @-@ finals against Great Britain .
&quot; one thing I &apos;m quite er@@ ei@@ ous , is the fact that in my view of Than@@ asi was a little ref@@ unded in the battle , &quot; said He@@ aly .
he broken a r@@ acket in the US Open , but because of a struggle in the US Open , but it is not the first player who broke out a bat with himself and I know Than@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has in the US Open extremely well @-@ behavior , even among the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think that he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe he was treated as a little one .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he has never had a problem with other players , he is trained in the locker area , he trained well , he is a very stur@@ dy and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; le@@ aly also supported the decision to take part in the important decision making , which begins on Friday and he describes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common decision &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he as@@ sures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term part of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is focused entirely on the competition and not all the contro@@ vers@@ y around &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe that Nick was rapidly made up the rise , wor@@ rying about people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray . he goes up in the eyes of the public , and he deserves to support him , but we try to think him the consequences of his actions . some time outside the R@@ amp@@ en@@ lich@@ é in which he can only think about it , and it is best for the crew and it is best for him .
European refugee crisis : Hungary declared Emer@@ gency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declar@@ es the emergency and broke the border line with Serbia on Tuesday and was all fixed , who tried to come illegal into the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos was followed by the border , when hundreds of migrants were accum@@ ulated in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and ser@@ ene officials with rebel@@ lion .
people who have fled from violence , st@@ ained for an unknown period in a rural stri@@ pe on the road between the two check@@ points of countries and built tents , and settled down there .
but Fru@@ it@@ ating wins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helic@@ opter over them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Op@@ ens the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and rie@@ ve ins@@ ults against the Hungarian motiv@@ ators &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of them come back from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants would go back to Hungary during more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ater@@ al damages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there have to be held talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica dac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the Hungarian @-@ Ser@@ b Border came one day after the 28 @-@ nations block during a controversial meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could agree .
the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who were in exagger@@ ated Italy and Greece . they op@@ ted their hope that after all - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be agreed that the EU states would receive further 1@@ 20,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
but Hungary did not put its hopes for an overnight action from Brussels or his neighbors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Emer@@ gency shelter in two southern regions gave authorities more power to get out of the crisis , so that they could reduce streets and asylum seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plan to build a bar@@ bed dra@@ fts along its border with Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after it has finished a fence at the Ser@@ bian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison notes were used in the competition , the bar@@ bed @-@ wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant source of war in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East , and became a major part of the input into the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sts that most in@@ coming economic migrants are seeking a better life , and no war wings who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly contrary to other EU countries , including Germany .
the new laws , that occurred at midnight of Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall Za@@ us that led the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also place higher adhesi@@ on for condemned human beings .
&quot; due to the situation caused by the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of state , &quot; said J@@ ov@@ em@@ ian k@@ ov@@ acs rep@@ or@@ tern in the southern City of Sz@@ eged .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still consent to the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but Rep@@ orter from Associ@@ ated Press reported on the limit difficult to armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs .
Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities take 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others have already penet@@ rated the country into the country .
they come down by damaged the fence , they are now in police advance and be accused of criminal off@@ ence according to the new laws .
public authorities are able to fix the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials joined two of the seven fron@@ tier crossing with Serbia , after a mig@@ rat@@ ation with bar@@ bed @-@ wire to close the borders .
chaos conver@@ ts the main border crossing , near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and op@@ ted a crowd to push themselves aside .
about 20 I managed to come up , but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants has blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are travelling to Hungary .
vote @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clin@@ tons Pre@@ leap in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national pol@@ l hal@@ ved
the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to keep a double @-@ dig@@ it lead in the democratic race at the national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her opposite to the ground .
Clinton has now supported the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the elections ( 58 % before ) , while elsewhere is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Bi@@ den who has not yet announced whether he is can@@ st for the presidential ministry , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections .
more than five months before the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is firm , which candidates will support them .
but Clin@@ ton &apos;s supporters are more durable in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost some gains in a series of demo@@ graphic groups while S@@ anders obtained some profits .
Clinton holds a big edge in women and mind , but these ar@@ ches have less@@ ened .
your support among the men has declined significantly , and that is different here only with 5 points .
Clin@@ ics advantage over democratic voters under the age of 50 have ev@@ apor@@ ated , and they are now on the same level .
Clinton has yet a big lead in the older voters .
last month , Clinton had been a double @-@ dig@@ it lead in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 point lead to this group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about half of the democratic voters of the elections pro@@ long say they would go to Clinton with enthusiasm if it was nominated by the Party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a quarter would support them with some advantages and a further 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidates .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ ton &apos;s latest supporters especially from her are thrilled .
the views are stronger mixed with those who are not going to support Clinton - only about a quarter it would support her .
while 48 per cent of the democratic voters of the elections will say that she will support Clinton with enthusiasm , say , less republi@@ can voters say this about their peak in Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ ie suppor@@ ter are asked in an open question why they want to be the nomin@@ ee , is the most common response that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by that it &apos;s time that a woman president is president ( 13 per cent ) and that she is the best candidate for job ( 10 percent ) .
by Clin@@ ton supports fans also , their connection with Bill Clinton is also mentioned ( 9 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consent to dealing with the problems and voters are also quot@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the Vice President thro@@ ws a potential for the presidential policy , 57 percent of the democratic voters of the elections pro@@ voke him in the race - though a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked for elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
by Clin@@ ton &apos;s followers , more than half , that Bi@@ den would have made their second choice far ahead .
decides Bi@@ den , will not decide for nomin@@ ation of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clin@@ ics rise in front of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in the competition on 30 points without it in the race .
five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a nomin@@ ee with the best opportunities to win the election ; however , this number of 78 per cent has fallen in the last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; Cho@@ col@@ ates &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important at a candidate , call for democr@@ atically voters questions on voters .
similarly , as in the last month , not a single democratic candidate or potential candidate to vote for these voters of the elections is unacceptable .
the Democratic candidates and potential candidates bring good results with some important characteristics on voters of their party &apos;s elections .
ine@@ qualities regard Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den cuts with the three candidates most at honest@@ y while cl@@ assy &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty per cent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about His ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe it from him .
democratic voters of the elections also cover Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ological in accordance with their views .
with all of these measurements , about a quarter of democratic voters no opinion of something .
since questions about Hill@@ ary Clin@@ ics are still using a personal e @-@ mail address and a server in office as an external leader , most of the Democratic voters of the elections were satisfied with their declaration of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions altogether .
but it is another story in the American public altogether .
the majority of Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their statement , while only one third is satisfied .
the public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the problem of light came , split .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail account had no effect on their overall opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion has still deteri@@ or@@ ated .
it is mainly Republi@@ can , more than six of 10 , saying that their views from Clinton have become worse .
though Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trusted , this is still a problem for them among registered voters total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of the vote do not hold them for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time 55 percent of the elec@@ tor@@ ate nation@@ wide may also be seen as being honest and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump get good notes with leadership .
from the six tested candidates , Bi@@ as , Car@@ son and Bush works best with honest@@ y .
a majority looks different rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the fault @-@ rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the elections amounts to 6 percent@@ ages .
Ben Car@@ son moves to popular survey near Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is the latest on C@@ BS News / New York Times close to Donald Tr@@ ump
in the two candidates , half of the support for voters decide in the new survey , and others lose dramatically on hold .
Republi@@ can voters support nation@@ wide continues tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was conducted in front of Fox News debate over the past month to 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but car@@ son d@@ oss in the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received in demo@@ graphic groups and exc@@ uses tr@@ ump among Republi@@ can voters with higher education education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio govern@@ or John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ cons@@ in govern@@ or Scott Walker , who is at deep@@ est by 10 % support during the last month at the end of now 2 % .
former Florida Gover@@ nor Je@@ b Bush , the former Gover@@ nor of Ark@@ ans@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are located at 6 % on the third place .
the error bu@@ b at the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can elec@@ tors in this latest pol@@ l is Plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week reveals that Car@@ son desc@@ ends into pol@@ ls - he ends at 19 % support among the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump especially Car@@ son .
having a look at one in the last week rising Car@@ son found Tr@@ ump some side @-@ hi@@ ve for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to put their belief in question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump to last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;

five members of the Br@@ otherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings .
almost two years after a student in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , MEPs are filed against five persons .
members of New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Br@@ otherhood took brutal attack in September 2013 by calling for his transport to the hospital , which has contributed to his death , shared the police .
officials said that he had been stra@@ ined with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked , while he tried to go through a frozen field on a target .
Mr. Den@@ g compl@@ ained finally about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Br@@ otherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and wa@@ ited an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , his symptoms of goo@@ gling and Andy Men@@ g to contact the national President of the Br@@ otherhood to bring advice , said Poli@@ gn@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point the members began to hide U@@ ten@@ si@@ lien and put the welfare of the Br@@ otherhood basically over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said polic@@ eman Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning to his wo@@ unds .
after an automobile @-@ seventh , Den@@ g has been added to mu@@ te force injury to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the chic@@ ane of the Br@@ otherhood . at least a student dies since 1970 each year on the ik@@ anen , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family represents , in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accountable , and this step by public authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Monroe felt an indic@@ t@@ ment for the first five members for the first five members .
two @-@ thirty members of the Br@@ otherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with broken or@@ attack and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or officially - this sanc@@ tioned , we will also hold them accountable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Br@@ otherhood , and the national Br@@ otherhood has res@@ ist its affili@@ ation to the group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Zin@@ ser@@ ign@@ ity comes , and the land@@ se will get into cal@@ ender , returns to bonds , and the economy will lead into a recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it all take and how long it is to keep .
in particular , the history of the economy offers a small guide to the procedure .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate and lasted 86 months .
the aggressi@@ veness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , al@@ beit not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial investments react .
hence , representatives from the US central bank have stressed that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end of the market , however , you may find that the whole excitement because of a Zin@@ ser@@ ber could possibly be exagger@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is in@@ vari@@ ably interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a Communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the grad@@ ual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at too low level to shine a se@@ is@@ mic shock , which seem many to fear .
however , this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is some historical trend @-@ based eye on how some areas of business could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of Zin@@ ser@@ ums can make things for a while vol@@ ati@@ l .
once the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is apparently a tendency that investments can be moved from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analy@@ st in a newer study on what happens after Zin@@ ser@@ rul@@ ings of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market has generally been in the warming trend - about 14 per cent - on the way to Zin@@ ser@@ ums , quite flat in the 250 days later ( average profit of 14,@@ 4 per cent according to a current analysis , the Bob Doll , head system strategy at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s published .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ ds later occur later in the increasing cycle and the return starts to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but Zin@@ ser@@ ums promote them often .
in the current case the F@@ ed has faced with some conditions which could not previously existed before and which could speed up a recession .
most notable is here that the brood @-@ domestic product is close to its lowest point at a fork @-@ height of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 Zin@@ c caves has been rated only twice the nominal capacity under 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3,@@ 6 percent , we expect this last year and expect to expect the third quarter following the Atlanta Chamber of Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zin@@ ser@@ ums with such a frag@@ ile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and throw the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this time is different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have made up a fork in the F@@ ed year round , and all eyes were aimed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week which ends on Thursday .
whilst many shr@@ ubs and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could push for an increase in that meeting , fut@@ ures trading gives only a percentage of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all the increasing cycles of 1950 to the present day in a super @-@ cycle with increasing momentum in GDP has taken place and pre @-@ rec@@ essi@@ on@@ us very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest , which has been waiting for the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are now 74 months .
the firm in@@ comes also vol@@ at@@ l , as the market penetration a Zin@@ ser@@ height , and the pattern is quite similar as on the capital market .
the main difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than in shares if they change their strategic course .
when bonds seem to shift the direction once the first increase / lo@@ wering is carried out in the cycle .
at the end of the increase @-@ cycle , the sei@@ zu@@ res immediately falls , said the Deutsche Bank .
the o@@ egen of Charles Schw@@ ab believes that the increase in interest rates will result in return that returns between longer and shorter anus and lead to a lo@@ wering of the curve .
high @-@ off bonds often bring better yiel@@ ds in such a climate , although &quot; we are still war@@ y to expect higher yiel@@ ds , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Anal@@ yst@@ in at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
interesting , Jones says that markets have already been adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from the strength of the dollar and the drop of inflation expectations there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of more str@@ ingent monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the decre@@ asing is flat@@ ter , cre@@ ten@@ se have increased and the vol@@ at@@ ility has risen - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy .
in the large and whole companies , companies who benefit the greater part of their operations in the United States , profit from interest rates and more attractive local products .
multinational companies with high debt will become worse , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares ten@@ ds to respond very positively , three months after an initial zinc levels , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st in a report for customers .
companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded the company with f@@ aint balance after each of the interests in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 , on average by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital yield as well as low vol@@ at@@ ility in their shares also met their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percent@@ ages ) and 3 ( percent@@ ages ) .
debt is a big problem .
businesses with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most , said Gold@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside of its pure share consumer consumers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; benefit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will also benefit from the rising dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as@@ parag@@ us could see profits from higher profits , even if experts are of different opinions , how fast this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says parliament@@ arians Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Conserv@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the station because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ver@@ du@@ mm@@ ung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly different from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also represented at the BBC Music Awards and said that she was just The Br@@ its im@@ iti@@ zed
parliamentary colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins reached the show The Voice and said that this is not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; walk &quot; on Classic FM , claim@@ ing a leading female member and raises new pressure on the transm@@ itter , to prove that he does something to do what the priv@@ ations does not do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Conserv@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also said the BBC Bos@@ sen , that the public @-@ legal radi@@ os@@ an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is increasingly no longer differenti@@ ated from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also represented at the BBC Music Awards , which started in the last December .
the BBC Music Awards , who started last year , The Br@@ its seem only to be under a different name .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples that you actually just im@@ itate what is already in the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General dire@@ ktor pointed out the accus@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 goes far from its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and enligh@@ tenment .
what I learn from Radio 3 ? I will learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of radio 3 to find new music and to give new works to order , I consider it really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davis , that harder to get involved in doing the audience , as it did in the past because the British are less informed of classical music .
radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sports are provided under fire for the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory MEP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins takes on The Voice - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was purchased by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for the cost of 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall was insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Fa@@ ith and Boy George as a judge - &quot; was produced in a special BBC way . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wishes to find the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit out of our &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house barn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if the next time it was a entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to ex@@ clude the order of other rows of The Voice in the future or to give funds for other entertainment formats .
Internet transform@@ ers climb@@ ed in August at the s@@ lower and the Black Friday can be responsible for it
during the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the records in the year 2000 .
on @-@ line sales increased three years ago by using phones to purchase
experts believe that the Black Friday has stopped in November the expenses
for over a decade , the virtual dispos@@ able shopping has geb@@ o@@ om@@ t , and many of the main shopping streets of Britain have turned into Spirit .
but experts say there are now signs that online expedition are stag@@ nat@@ ing after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales are stag@@ nat@@ ing after new numbers show just seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG @-@ sales sin@@ es of the Guardian .
he explained that the online sales purchases made up three years ago when shop@@ pers started working with their phones &apos;s purchases .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do so in different environments , for example at home on the sofa .
but now they comm@@ utes that and we may possibly experience that growth is reduced .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon which was imported from America is cited as a reason for subsequent revenues rates .
experts believe that buyers held their purchases from this event , which will take place last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers around their computers to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealer @-@ sites cr@@ ashed away .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyer could hold for bar@@ gain , buyers of it might stop to make purchases .
a study conducted by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found that between $ 5 issues was issued more than 1 £ o .
in some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now being carried out via web @-@ shops .
at the same time more than a quarter of people clothing and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inside .

she said it is necessary to face the growing demo@@ graphic trends , which have more female single @-@ households , which make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there still works a majority of men in our stores .
we need to move this stronger into balance .
in principle , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a UK in FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also designed their top team to reflect a compar@@ ative number of men and women in executive positions .
King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial status .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervis@@ ory boards .
King@@ fis@@ her reported a decline in the half @-@ year gain and parag@@ rap@@ hs , after the group handed down the costs for closing the shops .
because of the trends King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q has to open 200 new branches .
function@@ aries of A@@ I / DO@@ B due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the Landes@@ gericht Kl@@ agen@@ furt , on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian vol@@ leyball @-@ runner A@@ I / DO@@ B must be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and for@@ ks .
the accused did not guilty .
one of them was charged also because of am@@ using .
this accus@@ ation he was released in May right in May .
the current process was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to Ober@@ sta@@ ats@@ an@@ alogue Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in pre @-@ investigations that the accused made in the years 2006 to 2011 funds from the accounts on which they used in their functions disp@@ on@@ ing for private purposes .
the damage was charged with about 400@@ ,000 Euros .
the sports @-@ functional are also charged with finance .
this fact is the Chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , Jud@@ ge Michaela San@@ in , aus .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity made the defense that the association was not a asset not at any time .
the sports @-@ union could have applied only elev@@ ations and the sport@@ club that had spent a lot of time and money in which they had spent a lot of time and money , out of debt - the Passi@@ va beg@@ ru@@ gues in 2001 around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( approx . 44.@@ 000 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then we were standing in front of the situation : do we keep the club on or block us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; one of the accused , in the bread@@ making of the financial statements of the financial market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then decided to take this task with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have used money to get our life insurance as security during the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in the withdrawal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the association has been agreed , you can manage the money , there should only be no debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the pay@@ out of the compens@@ atory har@@ ps was det@@ ained until 1991 was approved . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , one became a part of the compens@@ ations for only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus has been in the account balance .
therefore , it also seemed l@@ ump @-@ work - and not detailed bus@@ hings , explained the former Ob@@ lig@@ ament to the proceedings .
the accounts and as@@ parag@@ us wo@@ unded the two def@@ endants in common , said the second def@@ endant .
why the withdrawal from the club were not revealed in detail , the judges asked .
the society has not been interested in detail for financial security , just the school@@ ing has been , so the answer .
as in 2011 against the one functioning , the amount of EUR 1@@ 20,000 euros had been transferred to the relevant account of an amount of EUR 1@@ 20,000 euros .
that is appropri@@ ations , the accused made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this securities account went on the name of the second def@@ endants and was not known according to his statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to know the Jud@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the answer for a long time .
then he said , he said that this is the best for the association .
if something had happened , nobody would have known something of this money , the prosec@@ ut@@ or to the room .
the ro@@ l@@ ament@@ ed sei has been informed , right of the function@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sli@@ ding &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why compensation ? , we wanted to know Jud@@ ge and prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then the first accused , he did not agree with this wording as the association had never been a damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom you are all from the hook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function said , he never did a c@@ ents , he only calcul@@ ates od@@ le @-@ money and di@@ ets .
in di@@ ets , he added the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not be accused .
these are according to a revision in which everything has been judged as correctly , no longer has been preserved , they declared .
kilomet@@ re money also had the second def@@ endant .
all the in@@ voices are made in cash , so that he must have to drive from his location international market to the Bank after B@@ lei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
the main proceedings will be carried on September 23 with the witness of witnesses .

time of decision on interest rates for the US @-@ Not@@ en@@ bank
the world ob@@ serves when the U.S. st@@ aves have come closer to two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , in order to meet the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest rates are raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists requested by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now think the F@@ ed will keep a little longer and keep interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0,25 % .
it is a historical event because it is seven years ago , since the F@@ ed interest was set to NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time we approach a situation where a big central bank could start the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , colum@@ n@@ ist staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good performance level , tr@@ illion dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate only a small inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ omy outlook for global relations .
it warned the markets to increase on an increase , but the signs suggest that chances are good against such a step .
the decision is to be announced at 8@@ pm ME@@ Z on Thursday
depos@@ it@@ ating at the Delta State University
after the shot and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later went to his colleagues a note to say that he would &quot; p@@ ity &quot; with the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could make it impossible , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that Lamb , lec@@ turer for ge@@ ography and Social @-@ scientific education at the Delta State University , the emergency number from 10 : 00 am Monday morning .
and said , he was shot on someone and someone killed .
Lamb told the staff of the emergency situation , sending police police to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I created my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; swe@@ ar dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was in the house , who will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the bom@@ b to his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when the police came to the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , the said , &quot; I am sorry , I could do it back .
I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved . &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb &apos;s 300 miles on the Delta State University , where he k@@ th@@ ane Schmidt , a professor of history , kill , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening , as polic@@ emen turned him around .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Univers@@ ität@@ ts @-@ President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said , he did not know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supp@@ os@@ edly believed that Pr@@ ent@@ iss also had a relationship with Schmidt said authorities on Tuesday , it does not give &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Trinity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who told she was about seven years married , as a &quot; good Person . &quot;
these two were avoided 15 years ago , but friends remained .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ ent@@ iss would have a daughter who is 19 and she was destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss was their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ iss worked online from home , after statement by Lin@@ s@@ day K@@ now@@ les , who was identified by the Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ ent@@ iss .
K@@ now@@ les said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss , who poss@@ essed a dog called Light@@ ning , who met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; they always wanted to help other people , &quot; said K@@ now@@ les
the police said , Lamb returned to a certain moment on Monday to tell them , &quot; he does not go into prison . &quot;
as polic@@ emen it arrived on the highway 1 near Green@@ ville later on that night , Lamb &apos;s car to the side , flew to foot , ran into the forest and k@@ ites himself with a shot .
Lamb received a doc@@ toral at the spring of 2015 from the Delta State University an Doc@@ tor@@ ate on the university website .

Euro@@ sets : Lufthansa is building the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major consolidated management .
half a billion euro in year wants to save the Lufthansa Group alone with a better organization .
in 150 of the world &apos;s around 1000 managers , the Group &apos;s Group will cost the workplace .
with the pilot en@@ ge@@ werk@@ schaft there is no new negotiation .
Lufthansa is building its corporate structure and values the new App@@ lic@@ en@@ ary Euro@@ vision .
the goal of the real@@ ign@@ ment is a result contribution of around 500 million Euros per year from pay@@ - and rede@@ em@@ syner@@ gies , distributed the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , there will be no member of the board in Lufthansa even in the future .
the Billi@@ g@@ flu@@ ent Euro@@ bond@@ age can therefore be developed as stand@@ alone as possible .
in the executive team , Chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt for Euro@@ land .

new negotiations with the pilot
in the collective bar@@ racks with the pilot &apos;s cock@@ pit ( VC ) the negotiations are supposed to be res@@ umed to the stra@@ igh@@ tened strike on this Thursday .
so that the trade union shared .
the topic of the talks is supposed to be the rest@@ ing scheme for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cock@@ pit would like to achieve results in a year with a forecast record &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between trade union and Air@@ line led to various strikes in the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; background is in addition to the trans@@ itional supply of the pilots the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows that Lufthansa cuts in the fight against cont@@ ests to the Group &apos;s own tr@@ ink@@ ing@@ y Euro@@ capacity . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United may not play monthly fre@@ t@@ arri@@ or
do Sha@@ w f@@ lashes in the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , a double fin@@ ca of his right leg .
while this brought the left margin to tears and ex@@ clude him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al gives hope not that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a rec@@ kl@@ ess attack by Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno during the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was in the PS@@ V region .
he was treated in nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before he was brought to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double bed and is in hospital . &quot;
he will be moved up tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operates in Manchester .
it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has been very difficult and then fantastic , and then this happens .
in the locker room he had a oxygen mask .
he cri@@ ed .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double trial , then the six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy to be a red map and the nar@@ rowing of a meter meter .
Nicola Riz@@ z@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not pun@@ ished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee was mist@@ aken .
you can judge for yourself when I say that a El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were sus@@ cep@@ tible .
it was a very dramatic attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et in Sha@@ w@@ h &apos;s account : &quot; I thank you all for your news . words cannot describe how broken down , my way to recovery begins now , I get stronger again . &quot;
in this : Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at the PS@@ V
the England Resi@@ stance has an added incentive with the Europ@@ am@@ eister@@ schaft in France an added incentive to recover until the upcoming June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very narrow breach . &quot;
if a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our player to cut an enemy .
Mor@@ eno f@@ lashes a leg break , when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear it is a very bad injury , that is not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , who was travelling in another direction , so it looked as if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with SB@@ S@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be .
I feel very bad about it . I am sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ Player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ play by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly , David Cameron The Lor@@ ax is better known ?
it &apos;s one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not last long before you know it almost completely .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite child &apos;s book was asked to give himself the prime minister to The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 created environmental analysis of Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , he writes Cameron in a message on the company of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , turbul@@ ent , creative , and with a powerful message , it is a book I liked to read my children because it seems always to give an image or message that we have so far missed . &quot;
everything nice and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron told the plot of book , instead , displaying a content of the movie version of 2012 , displaying new characters and details added to extend the fairly short origin@@ als .
&quot; in the middle of the silent town Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , he hopes to see a real tree , &quot; read her desire . a love @-@ interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theod@@ or Se@@ uss Geis@@ el lau@@ tete and the 1991 passed , but completely unknown .
as if this would not be suspic@@ ious enough : the text was presented by Cameron as the summary of the Lor@@ ax film which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Datab@@ ase , where everything is artificial , and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Audre@@ y , to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is familiar with the action of the book so little . here , an un@@ seen sitting , such as the local environment , Th@@ need stri@@ ck@@ enden Once @-@ ler , in spite of the protests of the nam@@ ental Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ vering , sn@@ ail , sn@@ ail , car@@ ve @-@ har@@ dened character , &quot; which will be devast@@ ated in the name of the trees .
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a Hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in succ@@ ession to a child .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ person said that the text was probably made by Camer@@ on &apos;s election office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Camer@@ ons employees , but there were no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened with the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
based on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , a difficult task , but when you selected the Ka@@ der , the England for the tour , is a repet@@ ition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series , defeat is not on my map .
I would not finish a down@@ wards .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks Page is perhaps less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batt@@ ing assembly , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not carry the s@@ cars of 2012 only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball turns Mo@@ een Ali as spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown mag@@ nit@@ ude on test level , is an option for the attack .
this is based on news : Adam Ly@@ ub@@ le@@ det from England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
the decision to let Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his boss in Yor@@ k@@ shire to properly analyze .
with his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but tough reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ ker has focused on results .
there was no question mark at Joe Roo@@ t , for example , and this led to the nomin@@ ation since - and I said this - players have their own best selection .
a long time ago , one could have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate .
when he hopefully strikes further sales for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there will be another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised its position even if he did not give so good performances , and this was not surprising me ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question of how much time a Test @-@ Stri@@ ke receives to be his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - as Sam Rob@@ son got before him - while Nick got nine got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to do home and forward @-@ moving .
the only accus@@ ation that you can rise was that England had first entered Jonathan Tr@@ ott in the Caribbean when Ly@@ th was in peak form - but this lost chance now lies in the past .
alex Hal@@ es comes in and he is a stroke that I highly appreciate .
he is a X factor cri@@ mp @-@ player that we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he sco@@ red 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , what struck us very well .
he must obtain at least the same chances as the before him , but of course this depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to allow Mo@@ een to cook beside Cook , which would bring an extra @-@ spin @-@ bowling and four qui@@ icks would receive , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a stroke cannot beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a devil @-@ shirt from cri@@ cket @-@ players .
Mo@@ een maybe did his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is he a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ colleague Just@@ in Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests with the first drop until he entered in 2001 when Open@@ er entered .
he was immediately made a three hundred rings and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes into the Ka@@ der as Back @-@ up Sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he was very impressed me as a young man .
people may see their statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup Sp@@ inn@@ ers who raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some smart additions to the co@@ aches .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dee , the Bat@@ sman from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master@@ ful .
he is one of the nicest guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experience as it has played amongst all conditions and against all the attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes to the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and power into the setup .
I always felt that he created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as players or as co@@ aches , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can be fresh in the locker room , even if the news stand in line with the before mess@@ engers .
Coll@@ ys Team@@ mate with Dur@@ ham , Ben Stok@@ es , will not be used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , Roo@@ t received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team members do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players will depend on their jobs .
such decisions are not made easy heart .

we could also call it Dave and Georges Self@@ ie agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb over summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of himself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it is always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wishes for an outdoor UK inside the EU Zel@@ ez@@ h - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and can see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials come up to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ dal ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is a allies , but it has been in power for 10 years before it looks bad for them , as it is for the exagger@@ ated exp@@ ul@@ sion such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
French President François Hollande look back to his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
he is also a bl@@ ending power .
Poland might soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left side .
it is hard to imagine that they will be a leg absor@@ bing to help the Self@@ ie British , whose energy should be used better to prevent Scotland &apos;s leaving from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ stic tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even fail to conf@@ use notes , quite in the SN@@ P style , during the UK refer@@ en@@ dum@@ my campaign to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , suspected my friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a ple@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won &apos;t be derived from the new negotiation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how far the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU sc@@ ep@@ tics is the oligar@@ chy of the Press@@ eb@@ ar@@ one as it did during the by Tony Ben@@ n inspir@@ en@@ du@@ ms 1975 but not that our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 supported .
they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ists who has made a name for itself as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Ger@@ ade @-@ ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; correspon@@ dent correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ 30s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all its cra@@ y@@ ness , Ed Mili@@ band , who were his enemies .
this was part of the Med@@ ley of wheel @-@ caring Sch@@ ur@@ ken , phone @-@ h@@ ack@@ able foreigners and the P@@ seudo non @-@ In@@ countries that poss@@ essing most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bl@@ air thought similarly about it , but realized that when you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa in a c@@ age you have to better ban@@ anas in order to di@@ stract him instead of his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more bl@@ ur@@ ri@@ ans as a blu@@ air itself , as he put himself Camer@@ ons to referendum , that was refused by the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened to him a back@@ door .
the press has never heard that .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly br@@ aps on the back on Monday - I told him that he was no time for me to waste water - seems to be in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t , but a strategy of 80 @-@ he years to repeat , an error at that time and now .
it may take , but it must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but surely by Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position on Europe is - I express it very friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff tendency and the wil@@ deren favor of Tor@@ y Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but not a Ben@@ n@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in radio and on TV this week said that the sc@@ outs in him were struggling to admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns appointment of the pro@@ vo@@ zier@@ end John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ anz@@ ee was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ 30s , when his old father turned to be in television about his efforts , working @-@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet without going too far and to lose its cabinet job .
Hil@@ ary &apos;s fight was still more attractive .
but to fight in order to remain &quot; under all circumstances - Ben@@ ns expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and Members according to all reports on their closing days on the assembly .
whatever the tou@@ ching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey it - think that he even touched me - News discipline stays important in the age of TV around the clock and above all things in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a brood @-@ centre of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it is correct to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe which allows him to hold lab@@ ours support in the referendum for a comprehen@@ sion , such as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell it told .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins think sure .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic ambig@@ u@@ ities to the EU membership - in accordance with its Ben@@ n@@ ite Bel@@ ag@@ er@@ ungs @-@ Economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ si@@ dents that is a central principle of dog@@ matic dispute .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son believes that J@@ C will no campaign for leaving - will be committed to foreign diplom@@ ats to try to find in everything a sense of their supervis@@ ors .
why should Paris or Berlin have wast@@ ed political capital - they also have suspic@@ ious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction in the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded at the start on Monday of something that British Inf@@ lu@@ ence Security Forum was ren@@ amed .
experts critic@@ ise report from Public Health England via e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
alleg@@ ations of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , they joined The Lanc@@ et by limiting the use of Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resi@@ li@@ ence of the data and directed towards the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a editorial in the medical journal Per@@ et last month , the &quot; exceptionally wind@@ y foundation , &quot; on which p@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the alleg@@ ations &quot; build up &quot; on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor for European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ ellen , Professor of Clinical epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should rely on the effectiveness of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estim@@ ation is that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estim@@ ation is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are approximately 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of sp@@ elling and mod@@ elling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who have been sum@@ mon@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ specific criteria analysis - MC@@ DA ) to perform their opinions on the damage caused by various nic@@ otine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ago said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose head had previously been received by British American Tob@@ acco funding ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the testim@@ onials of BA@@ T to Public Health in a Sustainable Development Report , they said .
one of the 12 participants expressed in the meeting to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer but not funding , which he should have received according to reports previously of the tobacco company Philip Morris International they added .
the reasons for selecting the members of the Gre@@ ase are not delivered , but include several known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes Champions , some of which also provide a branch of industries in the paper .
some other participants in this session are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting the tobacco head took part of p@@ he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; den@@ oted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; signi@@ fies that there is a lack of &quot; tough &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence of most products in most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ago said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claims of p@@ he said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence up until now that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were supposed to serve as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smok@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he said that alleg@@ ations of BM@@ J was already re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smok@@ ers dies at his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggest that health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes compared to it is low , but that we continue to study the long term effects .
p@@ he has the unique duty to inform the public about what evidence and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion over the relative haz@@ ards compared to tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0,000 people die yearly from a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking costs the national health system two billion £ per year .
by clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should aband@@ on East@@ ders , says former Chief of Channel 4
the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should stop , programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice to send . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broad@@ casting should be used only to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK radio stations .
he critic@@ ized the BBC that they will probably be seen on public @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard cont@@ acting Age against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC @-@ General , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations said Johnson said that he tried six years in his time with Channel 4 without success , with the BBC in contact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sends , which would also be clearly displayed by no sub@@ stitution ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communication Committee under his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the Rund@@ funk@@ Fee , what I consider in the medium or long term for a good idea , one should at least give his production on programs , others do not make or order .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class window , because they want to reach as wid@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that otherwise no one would show this , is a joke , it is ridic@@ ulous , it is naturally non@@ sense .
Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a rainy tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ ders is another one , ad@@ mitt@@ edly made both self @-@ productions .
honestly , other channels would give your right arm for it .
I am eager to see how this should be public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t believe this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , a busin@@ essm@@ an for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC den@@ noc@@ ence to hunt for reviews &quot; because of the ambitions of the people who work there and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular ship@@ ments of the BBC will again give what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart @-@ Vortrag in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like East@@ ders should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs &quot; should go to BB@@ C4 , where you cannot measure their tasks , and they could argue if they are going on their common missions to justify 4 billion £ Rund@@ funk@@ tions , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that nobody saw . &quot;
you put them into a window @-@ window in which nobody wanted to ever see it .
for the Rund@@ funk@@ Fee , Johnson said the board : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can obtain the best value below .
of course , you think all , think that one receives a great value for $ 150 per year , but for folks who is for the 150 £ a lot of money to ask myself whether that &apos;s true , as they do not consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ Chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , urged the BBC to review and maintain its fri@@ th@@ ian mission , to form and maintain . &quot;
he said , just little from the BBC production would now officially classi@@ fy as education - he said that there is 1 % of their TV production and 0,1 % on the radio - and she should take an example to the public @-@ legal television sen@@ ders in Australia and Canada .
the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , from which he said that only a handful on television are shown , and with the commercial sc@@ ans alliances to make everything available online .
&apos; Son@@ ogen@@ etics &apos; can control brain cells through sound @-@ waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ i@@ ards change the direction in the moment in which they will be pun@@ ches with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have bre@@ d wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified ge@@ ological systems , which can be controlled by exhau@@ sts of sound@@ b@@ umps .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change direction in the moment where they have sound impul@@ ses , which have high frequencies for human hearing in order to be listened to .
the impul@@ ses work by the switching of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels , which respond to ul@@ tras@@ o@@ unds .
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure , called Son@@ ogen@@ etics , used in ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und , to activate a number of brain , cardi@@ ac and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La Jol@@ la , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths @-@ brain stimulation , a invasive procedure which gives electrical impul@@ ses in the brain of people to treat symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
mer@@ c@@ aches are usually not responding to ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , he found out , reinforce the ul@@ tras@@ o@@ unds , that then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms .
the reinforced ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und cells seem to be called on structures , the TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels and be found in the membrane of some of the thro@@ ws .
the sound@@ pro@@ pers effect the opening of these ion@@ ary channels and activate the cells that they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und @-@ controlled Nem@@ i@@ ani , the wor@@ ms , the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ if@@ s wear @-@ 4 channels .
when he turned ul@@ tras@@ o@@ unds to the changed creatures , the b@@ umps are strengthened through the micro@@ bl@@ ers and transferred to the wor@@ ms where they turn the modified mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ des .
the procedure has made some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gen@@ etics , a ground@@ breaking tool , which allows scientists to inter@@ play with neur@@ ons with the impul@@ ses of the light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ etics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that has to be sent to an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain , the low @-@ rate ul@@ tras@@ o@@ unds tissues can pass crit@@ ically and thus can be sent in the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the appropri@@ ated human neur@@ ons temporarily pr@@ one to the ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und Signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

eight golden rules for living in student residence
eleven years ago I moved to a student dormit@@ ory , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral re@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se they anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ lasting discomfort regarding others .
most of what I learned can dist@@ illed within eight simple rules .
the entrance in student dormit@@ ory ranges from easy nerve wre@@ cking to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
it is temp@@ ting to sh@@ out : people tell you where you get from it , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you are &quot; honestly Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it is just a book@@ keeping ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distr@@ acts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with which you would not speak even if your eyelashes were in fire tri@@ bun@@ als and these fire ext@@ ingu@@ ishers .
let people .
the rooms of people often turn into beverages , film night locations and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people draw and wear their under@@ wear .
in this case , you do not remember to join the university with a relationship
voic@@ ed orders receive a gro@@ be treatment at the university .
your room should be a refu@@ ge , but many student dormit@@ ories are creating a space @-@ to @-@ room bar@@ ber culture , which can be friendly and socially and can lead to life long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship goes on , but you have to go away so that I get the energy back that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to sense when a comm@@ it@@ ones is exhausted from con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send it a text rather to kno@@ ck .
A@@ prop@@ os ank@@ lo@@ pfen : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he looked several things .
friendship through B@@ aking .
since you begin at the peak of the back Man@@ ie , the clo@@ ck@@ bill at the height of people to present themselves with a dish full of brow@@ nies , less strange as the welcome of the 1950 @-@ he years &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I made you something to smile . so , and now please smile if I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
homemade treats , is a good way to make friends .
your ro@@ omm@@ ates feel obliged to enter@@ tain himself and will eventually end your face with a delicious surprise .
of course this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
badly mixed cl@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people as@@ le@@ ep up if you pick up .
to ste@@ al food is a common crime in student residence .
of course , the cl@@ ut@@ ches of chicken is a theft , but is it the taking of a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check that with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they tell themselves to serve themselves , even if they cook in the interior .
if somebody pick up your stuff is the annoying , and you have been my compassion - but try to deal with it as my ro@@ omm@@ ate that added their milk a so@@ ap to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .
it is now in prison .
they shouldn &apos;t make noise , the people from sleep or from work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent man , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of pro@@ ver@@ b to the people who sit in the glass building .
a girl on my cor@@ ridor asked her neighbors , whether it makes them something out , Drum &amp; Bass something qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they re@@ acted with even more mature music .
when they finally heard about 5 o &apos;clock , they kindly left their neighbours to sleep two hours before they left their own music , their door lock , and went to their three @-@ hour examination .
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would happen to be acci@@ dental in the same student dormit@@ ory ?
the other way round , it would not be in@@ comprehen@@ sible , if you stick to them for a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future sp@@ ouses , separate themselves and then you will see each day and perhaps bring along the way they bring together all common friends ?
of course , the heart goes his own paths - but if a hot ro@@ omm@@ ate is definitely not your future sp@@ ouses , try at least to talk to your sub@@ du@@ b a little reason .
in the ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating moment in which you notice that somebody has left its keys in his not strong room , is the border between a Ul@@ k and bullying , when it seems .
a good example is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes the b@@ um@@ er@@ ang .
place through bur@@ dock a valuable and am@@ using lesson via safety - but don &apos;t miss someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
close your door and place your keys into a glass of water that you then put in free@@ zer - but t@@ ack@@ ets your poss@@ essions at the ceiling no more than twice .
town@@ houses for refugees , single @-@ educ@@ ators , t@@ ear@@ ners
the real estate company Markus G@@ ild@@ ner is built in the Middle @-@ Frank@@ ish Eck@@ ental fri@@ ction houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the alone mother and the bar@@ ter conden@@ ser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I show how one can still grow good and well today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview
thousands of refugees will be pushing to the market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how quickly the living space can be created : it builds in a project of fri@@ ction houses for refugees .
Mr G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees will come to the market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : moderate accommodation in containers or turn@@ around has no sustainability .
for people stay to a great part here .
in view of the refugee stream , we also need a living space within the next few decades .
a very ban@@ qu@@ ist , dre@@ ig@@ esch@@ os@@ sig@@ nia detached house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a town@@ house needs the least place .
it makes the integration .
this is different , if people sub@@ blocks the people of housing .
each of the six homes that are just built in the pilot project consisting of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees will say it is back peace , I go back .
then the houses can be easily changed after the respective needs .
how much is the cost ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters of living per house is ap@@ ed to 184 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction has taken six months .
this is appropriate .
do the buildings have made their plans complex ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : construction has my project correct in the correct way .
especially complicated it is getting the dro@@ w@@ ading no@@ amo@@ is worth of special construction and the slot machine .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
there is still sub@@ mits who creates three apartments in a detached house , needs at least three pitches .
only in cities is missing this place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the inhabitants responded to their Sem@@ i @-@ project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who have accused me of creating lux@@ uries for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not true .
but tigh@@ ten you not the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : true But we have had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but also a luxury apartments which can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the ordinary people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the alone mother or the bar@@ ter conden@@ ser .

iOS 9 : how you get the new iPhone operating system if Apple @-@ Update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be ordered by going to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; app and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install inst@@ aller .
some are gone after the installation to problems as they get an error , communic@@ ates that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to get the problem , users is recommended to either wait until the crash goes back or trying to update about iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may sound the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely to do that by hosting the updates . likewise , it will be easier to delete or install a special tool when the process is completed .
it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is up@@ loaded while updating or located near a charger , so the battery is loaded .
when the load is too low , Apple does not allow that the update will continue because the phone probably could switch on half way and lead to a breaking out of the updates .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice quar@@ ter@@ ausen and investing 310@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , Sam@@ t@@ ach@@ er@@ meister Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ist in Uta S@@ eim @-@ Sch@@ wart@@ z and As@@ endor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in many places in the country of doctors - As@@ endorf , on the other hand , Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Fel@@ ste@@ ausen on the 1st of October .
while Ur@@ sel rim is re@@ tired , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is his successor to his successor over the coming months .
after a uph@@ e@@ av@@ al phase , Müller opened the practice on October 12 until then he is investing 310@@ 000 euros to the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first glance , when the Fel@@ ste@@ ens was acquainted with Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll who is currently taking care of their professional education in the Ver@@ dener hospital and who also wants to enter into practice .
&quot; we always had in mind that the land@@ lords would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen and laughs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when so far I was simply ph@@ oned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
couple Müller liked the idea to run their own practice in the future in As@@ endorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we would like to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage he also sees to be his own boss soon .
and so one was agreed , the tr@@ ash bought the house with the practice .
living they are still in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there the second @-@ time family father Frank Müller also grew up , his Medi@@ z@@ inst@@ u@@ dium in Hannover followed stations in several medical offices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , N@@ ien@@ burg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a captain in Sul@@ ingen , in 2009 he was appointed for the intro@@ duc@@ tory not@@ ari@@ al in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is engaged in the DR@@ C @-@ Read@@ iness of Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19 the practice for the new boss is being prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ste@@ ausen , his wife is specialised in Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ ni@@ st@@ in ) to the Gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Mül@@ lers , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as home@@ work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end@@ os@@ copy is therefore out of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the reconstruction , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und studies as well as long @-@ term and resi@@ dual @-@ EK@@ GS and need an intercom more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a grant from a total of 500@@ 00 euros will receive the land@@ lords within the framework of a Förder@@ kreis ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) , as well as from the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and glad we are that the practice is going to be continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the general debate of Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 2000 patients according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll each quarter arrive in the practice field , in the North @-@ German average practice , there are about 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is another home office .
a positive side @-@ effect of the practice @-@ effects by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains noisy Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor did not have found it would have gone .
who attended &apos;s speech @-@ trip , in the way I still look in familiar faces : taking over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning of the field .
with their departure ends in As@@ endorf an era , after all , the medic@@ s have been practic@@ ing for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; reminds of Ur@@ sel rim .
a little melan@@ chol@@ y feel it after the long time already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we live further in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients will certainly still see , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ ni@@ st@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; your husband will be added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 @-@ square meter site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now I have always been pressed for gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , the couple has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls will also be high at our border line , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ould &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is clear that everyone who want to make a asylum application also could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people stand in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but clear is also that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , nor of the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia cont@@ empl@@ ates &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia
the Croatian government had previously announced , also Slovenia wants to continue traveling in direction to Austria and Germany and under circumstances also set cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
this is all this Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach though not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia , the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary - intensi@@ fy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already very controlled in the border of the Schengen area .
as the minister acc@@ ented , Sloven@@ in thus wants to give its limits to refugees but not wear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government un@@ divided , the first refugees have already tried in the night @-@ hours to Tuesday , in East Germany on the border crossing the T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d pass over to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police could open them in the nearby cor@@ n@@ fields .
according to local media ever since in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik was constantly governed by police vehicles with new refugees .
it is primarily aimed about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
also lif@@ egu@@ ards and the Red Cross are already in action .
in the coming days , his country with around 4,000 refugees , said Interior Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from presses at the Maced@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ b Border that have previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , in the direction of Croatia , reported Croatian and Ser@@ bian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade have asser@@ t that it is , people like to oppose certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media , at least in the morning , a first bus had arrived with around 50 refugees in the Ser@@ bian border town of Si@@ d , the course of the day would be further buses .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the passengers were travelling the whole night of the Maced@@ onian border with Serbia on the road .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has promised , so the police said we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
in this way , it could actually follow the shifting shift of the former Balkans @-@ route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat more western stretch .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior of O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had said that his country had prepared for the fall of a strong influ@@ ential of refugees with corresponding plans for possible failure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; details later he did not , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have comprehensive possibilities to limit control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you lead to strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the European partners in the country ever since has resulted in a good reference , which concerns the standard of the border controls .
on ser@@ b@@ astic site stuck behind the Hungarian Gren@@ zz@@ aun continue about 300 refugees .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media we would have spent the past night on the border crossing Hor@@ g@@ os , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border trans@@ itions include hor@@ g@@ os and back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely locked .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
the Ser@@ bian Minister of Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm part in Hor@@ g@@ os at a locom@@ otive address : he kept the debates on alternative routes from refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for early .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not currently be a very high income of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could not say if they would continue their trip over Hungary , Croatia or any other country .
accessory rates migrants to - dangerous - Alternati@@ v@@ rou@@ ts
however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute the refugees crossing their alternative routes in Croatia .
however , the border cross@@ ings between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the bor@@ der@@ land there are also 20 years after the end of Croatia .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police gave that a team of mini @-@ räum@@ er in the border region was sent .

the ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice has made awareness with this action to its 20 year anniversary and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s life , therefore we have gone through the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine L@@ ammer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conduc@@ t@@ ress of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice aid stands for the p@@ asser@@ s as well as questions and discussions at the disposal of volunteers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while some , a Pass@@ ant takes up spont@@ ane@@ ously , and set the sentence for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my life affir@@ med &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resume the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not too long &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they remain briefly reading , say phr@@ ases such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am still not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
again and again , at the edge of a little discussion about the action in itself , about life , dealing with the death .
Peter Hü@@ b@@ inger is just on site .
&quot; only when I make clear that for me that end up on this world , I can play responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic plant Mannheim , which is jointly owned by the Car@@ it@@ as@@ ant carriers of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice .
therefore , this public opinion is good for the 20 year @-@ old .
that not everyone wants to communicate with the tablets if it sounds , eventually it is a very personal matter .
the subject of death and dying is still fu@@ elled with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine L@@ ammer , although the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine L@@ ammer , has just made a lot of contribution to the hosp@@ ice movement in recent years .
a assessment , the Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id shares .
the death and grap@@ e @-@ companion belongs to the volunteers in the first hour .
by personal experience confronted with the issue , read them much literature and decided to engage in ster@@ ile help .
when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice r@@ archy was asked by calling for volunteers , it immediately reported and be in the establishment of the year 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the suffer@@ ers and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes , and in hosp@@ ice @-@ Saint Vincent .
all are they carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id can do well with their role and experience and experience .
&quot; I see the life of another war@@ te , stop it for precious , and cher@@ ished the moment , &quot; she says .
the offer of the out@@ patient E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice service is free and non@@ denomin@@ ational .
the financial support of the sick and donations of relatives and associations allows the training as well as training and supervis@@ or of mort@@ ality and grap@@ e @-@ companion .
every two years training will be offered to new employees .
the tablets described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Protest@@ ant Church ( M1 , 1a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .
there are also other personal wishes for post@@ cards .
Fed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , Fin@@ anz @-@ outlook for 2016 se@@ ated
Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appointing results for the last quarter , and the Lief@@ ert @-@ Gig@@ ant lowers his winn@@ ings for a whole year due to the weak@@ est demand for freight services and higher costs in its field transfer service .
the company also said that she is planning to recru@@ it about 5@@ 5,000 employees for the holiday .
at this time , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to adjust the 5@@ 0,000 seasons of the season for the holiday season .
the share fell on a 2.5 per cent in the Pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
Fed@@ Ex Cor@@ p. said to earn a profit between 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in financial year , which ends in the next May , 20 cent less than the previous pre@@ diction .
anal@@ ysts expected according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10.@@ 84 $ .
despite the price increases , the average prospect comes to 4.@@ 9 per cent and will be effective on 4th January and despite the higher inf@@ all for Bod@@ escap@@ ing gri@@ ds of heavy and large packages that are collected starting in November .
the company said it nevertheless anticip@@ ates that the result was increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher income and because of the growth in online trade .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will &quot; sound yiel@@ ds &quot; determining the we@@ aker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
plans for holidays employment were announced one day later than that of the R@@ ival U@@ PS , who plans to adjust 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional staff about the same number as last year .
in the quarter , this ended on August 31 , Fed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 per cent more than last year .
the earnings per share was amo@@ unted to USD $ per share , just behind the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of T@@ acks Investment Research asked analy@@ st predicted .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12,@@ 3 billion $ .
six of Z@@ acks answered anal@@ ysts expecting 12,@@ 23 billion $ .
Fed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in the international primary shipping company in recent years which brought sales to the sales in its unity Express @-@ shipping .
but the boom in online @-@ shopping has increased the results at Fed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher cost of greater packages and self @-@ health insurance .
the Express unit recorded a higher income due to higher prices , while the result was a result of higher labour costs in the cargo business .
in the Pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares by 3,@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , on 15@@ 0.15 $ .
on Tuesday she concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below the 11th of June .
on its most anticipated conference in the year , Federal Reserve Str@@ at@@ ula spent two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras &apos; ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to up@@ lift the leadership for the first time since almost a decade .
Dro@@ h@@ end about them at the end of the projected , two @-@ store@@ yed se@@ wing sa@@ wing is located a m@@ ural picture of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed Chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and their colleagues shall put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ annual order of Congress : maxim@@ izing the U.S. employment and prices here stable .
but since the big recession the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that there is an unknown party : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to un@@ acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed by the unprecedented interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets make anxi@@ ous to increase these vol@@ at@@ ility by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it only about one quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labor market and inflation will be foremost the most important thing to observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist in the Ma@@ kl@@ er@@ company Sti@@ el Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think when you were looking for a pre@@ text that would not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty about the global market is enough justi@@ fication , continues to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed is doing , which sec@@ ures itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists recently submitted by Bloomberg , have predicted the week of Zin@@ del .
the financial markets , however , expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator which shows only a 30 % chance of increasing .
this indicates a decline of the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the o@@ egen hit the p@@ unch , by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage worth 22@@ 8,@@ 89 points or by 1,4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy sustain@@ ing the proposition this week , John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the propos@@ itions at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if they do it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to go very far in their statement in order to re@@ assure the financial markets so that it is not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that a Zin@@ ser@@ ign@@ ition would calm the financial markets , because they do the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
still a month ago the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow@@ ing gra@@ zing of the mon@@ ary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States .
Y@@ ellen had been in spring and early summer , that in this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be necessary , an increase in the sentence .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ down , the improvement on the labour market in this year was solid .
the unemployment rate s@@ ank at 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the levels that sees the F@@ ed as full employment .
pay@@ roll delays have shown signs of recovery .
and although the inflation ran constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives said that the main reason was the temporary impact of much lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , Chef@@ ö@@ kon@@ om at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but financial markets around the world at the end of last month together after China had refused its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage was worth more than 16 % in May by more than 16 % , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of Chinese economy would under@@ go global growth .
the market has a bit relaxing in this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now nearly 10 % below the test@@ er of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ences are influ@@ encing the complex calculation as it will increase interest rates .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy has not been occurring within the last few weeks , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Mac@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the US Not@@ en@@ bank .
now he predicted that she will wait at least a month to get the effect better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the global economy is one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved in their decision @-@ making process .
but in the end of the end , the F@@ ed Monetary authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was huge in recent years .
the mere note of the then former leader of Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could make their mon@@ ary expansion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; prov@@ oked tur@@ ings around the globe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly flowing by the F@@ ed representatives , they can not only monitor the developments in another place , but also consult with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global strategy for the asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has an history of over@@ reactions to financial market movements that are apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
L@@ acker , un@@ authorized member of the Federal Open Market Committee , is advoc@@ ated for a Zin@@ ser@@ cave , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its benchmark points in three sessions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited recogni@@ z@@ able effects on growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives made these cuts .
the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as market re@@ unification in 2008 , Adam S. Pos@@ en , former member of the Committee on the interest rate of the Bank of England .
the recent turbul@@ ence do not come near this level , he said .
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which it is afraid of a Zin@@ del ber , because markets become an exciting , &quot; said Pos@@ en , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t believe they should take the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life @-@ care for refugees
more refugees arrive from those days in Germany .
you are welcome to prepare a warm welcome , not without the dedication of an honor@@ able volunteer .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a whole number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
among them belong Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is with body and soul teacher .
even with their 74 L@@ enses , they are still being taught .
every Thursday she does it in asylum seek@@ ers at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .

of course , this is the very different lessons as being at a right school .
Brasi@@ lian company Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to en@@ clear how important good nutrition during the lact@@ ation period is . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies , who are painted at fr@@ am@@ ers who are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that babies provide all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie around 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ ory focus is not the only di@@ et@@ etic adaptation is that the mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pro@@ s@@ red women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ tive
the municipal council Bern@@ ried permits the building amount for the 2.3 million Euros expensive sports hall .
and he did an exception .
the roof can be flat@@ ter for solar power stations .
planning for the long @-@ established Turn@@ hall@@ en@@ bau am Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ world come step by step ahead : in the recent church council meeting the processed construction has been de@@ vised without great discussion .
previously , the panel was decided among other things another application to build a legal &quot; exception , &quot; accepted &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we went to permit permission for a special form in terms of construction construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is said to be built with non @-@ comp@@ elling First and umbrella &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
background of the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; thereby we get a wonderfully large South @-@ roof , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again about the roof @-@ cutting , which should be prescribed for energy reasons - unlike in the development plan - under ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume of the hall is significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for the ten@@ sion@@ ing is no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der is more restric@@ tive in the rule of liber@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , at Turn@@ hall@@ en@@ bau , it is not a recur@@ rent project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we thereby create a preced@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Turn@@ hall@@ en@@ bau am Sport@@ Center is a collabor@@ ative project in the municipality and of SV Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros can be calculated at costs .
grant from the school and lat@@ itude support are expected .
in the next procedure , the application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is now submitted to the country &apos;s office .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ mb@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg should be closed before as scheduled - namely 2016 .
at the same time Dr Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will become the new director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of staff members move from P@@ ei@@ mb@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these are the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the Land@@ circle , confirmed the Land@@ r@@ ät@@ in Andrea Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision on this subject to the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board of Directors , and the conven@@ es on the next Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans are put into action then all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move with fishermen and the further existing inner station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the staff that cannot be offered to Sch@@ ong@@ au in W@@ eil@@ heim , will be offered a job in W@@ eil@@ heim , so Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the staff were informed about the plans .
triggered the change from Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been mist@@ aken first since the beginning of the beginning of the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic and is now moving to a private practice in direct direct proximity of the hospital .
on the question of who the follow @-@ up was said , according to Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fis@@ her &quot; in the game who was prepared to take over the direction of 1 October and to change with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this is in each case a &quot; stand@@ ings &quot; and a distribution of the quot@@ ation in the area of &quot; internal medicine &quot; , &quot; Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
Fischer is a specialist for ro@@ grad@@ ual and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised in the interior of gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic illnesses .
in part for the next two years fishermen with his team , if the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board will be attributed to both houses , until next year reached the former hospital of Kn@@ app@@ age , which has yet to be closed over 35 beds in P@@ ei@@ mb@@ berg after nearly 140 years .
so far the rural district had planned this for 2018 , if the current refurb@@ ishment is completed at the hospital W@@ eil@@ heim .
Land@@ r@@ ät@@ in Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß , which is also chairman of the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board , drew attention to what the house , which is owned by the Bundes@@ kn@@ ite , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; I &apos;m out of &quot; How it goes on with the property , Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not tell , there are several considerations .
at present there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a di@@ p @-@ eth@@ os .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what owner could not happen , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer on the Qu@@ asi @-@ Mov@@ ing to the Le@@ ch who had been received positively by the staff &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house , in which Fischer has worked for more than 30 years as chief psych@@ ologist , did not exist .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of medical director .
the Hospital P@@ ei@@ mb@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened in recent decades repeatedly by closing , departments were closed , for example the surgery and Obst@@ et@@ rics .
the Hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhine @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are called for tonight ( 20.@@ 15 PM ) at the Berg@@ ische HC .
the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga is in Wuppertal , though , is the clear favorite , cause for transmission , but there is none .
in the last season the Bad@@ ener at B@@ HC was related to painful defeat and have something good to do .
Jag@@ dar@@ fall with two per@@ sever@@ ing at Pr@@ at@@ au
two leaf@@ lets have been badly inju@@ red during her ma@@ ill on the morning .
during the Aber@@ n@@ tens on a Ma@@ is@@ feld at Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) , several h@@ unters have been in use as the police rus@@ hed .
after an iron @-@ disp@@ er@@ d@@ ges a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man severe injuries and were brought in hospitals .
how exactly this could come to the accident , was initially un@@ clear .
the crime syn@@ ch .
mixed 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violence
a fact is a fact that the police led to the ly@@ ric of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in the inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was killed , the young people killed and their bodies into a channel in Rock@@ enhausen .
one since Saturday mixed 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate is a perpet@@ rator to the victim .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cor@@ pse of the young woman was found at the Tuesday evening in rock@@ enhausen in Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as prosec@@ ution and police on Wednesday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as tat@@ to@@ ff , another one also applies in the evening , 20 year @-@ old , who was indeed marked the st@@ ating and the investig@@ ators led to the place of loan .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been missing on Sunday morning after she arrived at the eve for a visit to a autumn in rock@@ enhausen .
when searching for the young woman , the investig@@ ators put first into personal objects of the victim .
in surveys in the friend and acquain@@ t@@ ances of the suspic@@ ion , finally a Tat@@ ver@@ suspic@@ ion against the 20 year @-@ old .
the dirty perpet@@ rators led the police then to a channel in Rock@@ enhausen , where the cor@@ pse has been found .
the commemor@@ ate gave the authorities late in the police examination , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and the cor@@ pse has put into the channel .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be pre @-@ directed at the port of the harbour , the investig@@ ators lay down killing him to the burden .
the dis@@ solution on the near@@ er circumstances of fact are to bring further investigations .
refugees need accommodations : study war@@ ns against housing pres@@ sures
the location on the German apartment market is ten@@ se .
also more refugees seek a paid b@@ lei@@ gh .
the pressure on the market is growing .
the social housing situation is facing a challenge .
the distribution of distribution on the German housing market have long ago began .
with the coming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is now over@@ loaded in many big cities .
you compete with income @-@ weak citizens for the last paid apartments .
in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , it would have to build 400@@ ,000 new units by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to this result , a study comes on behalf of the trade @-@ debate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sozi@@ ale Housing Building &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison , this year , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany .
thus , 14@@ 0,000 flats are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial week .
many then come across the apartment market and are looking into the long sn@@ akes in front of the flats .
according to Stati@@ stical Federal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers were available to rent .
however , the negative development of the urban@@ ization is not only in the rising refugee numbers .
the study also makes significant meetings in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany finds a residential defic@@ it in front of itself , which is greater from year to year .
currently , in the metro@@ politan areas already occupied around 77@@ 0,000 housing units , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many m@@ our@@ ds were therefore inhabited in large cities with not@@ ables in W@@ G @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed longer in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the dol@@ drums on the apartment market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities the number of square meters per head has fallen back again in the past few years .
to solve the problem , the alliance reflects &quot; Social Housing &quot; build a new start .
in this case , new incentives for the social housing construction should be restored .
thus , the tax @-@ value tax could be disp@@ ens@@ ed and the fundamental tax for subsidi@@ zed apartments are to be exposed .
furthermore , according to Alliance , attractive tax @-@ operations are necessary .
the support programme for Refu@@ ge@@ es of the Staats@@ bank K@@ f@@ W comes well in cities and communities too .
a good week after the start on the assembly of 184 million euros , more than half of the approximately 300 million euros have been retri@@ eved .
now the project could even be sho@@ cked .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia to cor@@ ridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is practically no escape to Hungary than any more refugees choose from Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb An@@ no@@ un@@ ces to let the transit of Slovenia to the north without hur@@ dles .
however , the route is however dangerous .
Croatia wants to engage with neighbouring countries in Slovenia about setting up a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; I talked to the Sloven@@ ian interior ministers and when it is necessary we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; said the Croatian interior minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
the EU @-@ country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
after the shut@@ down of the ser@@ b@@ isch @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees went to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported the Croatian TV station R@@ TL .
Hungary had its border to refugees on the day before .
new laws that occurred the same day in force , make a decent asylum procedure in Hungary practically su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to make the refugees happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can go through , and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something .
but they are people who do not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had captured the first refugees at the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia in the neighbouring country .
most of the media has been reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and tax@@ en in the Ser@@ bian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after arriving , they would have tried to walk on the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border the refugees cannot reach Gren@@ zz@@ ä@@ une .
to this end , the bor@@ ro@@ strip of other dangers : there are still sharp min@@ en from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
Min@@ e@@ räum@@ er should quickly create a secure fit .
after Hungary after the closing of the border there is hardly any more refugees .
on Tuesday the police demanded 36@@ 6 per@@ missions .
shortly before the door on Monday there was still 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws are to overcome and def@@ ying the Gren@@ zz@@ a@@ uns as off@@ ence .
in the South @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eged , therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated .
condemned for up to five years and exp@@ ul@@ sion exp@@ ul@@ sion from the country .
according to information on the immigration authorities , on Tuesday in the newly built on the border of &quot; Tran@@ itz@@ onen &quot; a total of 94 asylum yiel@@ ds , nearly all - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applic@@ ants are 13 families with small children , as well as two elderly people .
on Wednesday afternoon , there were still 40 refugees here .
practically no one has granted a prospect in Hungary asylum .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe country country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the expired asylum seek@@ ers should be moved there .
in front of the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , there were only a few hundred refugees .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke we started working together .
they gathered the gar@@ bage to leave the tens of thousands of people in the past weeks on the road@@ side .
pl@@ y@@ lo@@ p@@ ens were dismant@@ led and one of the shops in the Grenz@@ ort was rebuilt .
nobody really wanted to speak for the purpose of this renovation .
Austria is allowed to reach Austria after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary only a few refugees .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
around 20,000 migrants stopped by government , but still in the country .
in Salzburg about 1400 people waiting for the trip to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; driving traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on instruction German authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in free@@ ass@@ ing we met several smaller groups of refugees on foot .
Mayor of the &quot; Gest@@ ran@@ ged &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were occupied after the bridge on Sunday with the Au@@ fr@@ aming &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when suddenly ten people were standing with travel off@@ ers at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wern@@ iger@@ ode mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to train by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany had surprisingly closed to the German railway traffic with Austria because of the refugee stream , she was able to immediately start his help and put the stud@@ ded together with two more hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au .
before we had the un@@ ob@@ struc@@ ted guest only once ch@@ ast@@ ed with J@@ ause and drinks .
we said the same , we will bring her by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; that was of course , &quot; so Stad@@ ler in O@@ Ö@@ N conversation .
they were very grateful .
a man did not let themselves to pass a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire@@ brig@@ ade .
&quot; this is very happy , &quot; says Stad@@ ler .
in the Saturday evening in Wels by a ICE in Wels by a ICE in the direction of Pass@@ au , it came up after the short notice that the railway traffic to Germany was stopped , but still trying to get the border .
however , the regional train has been picked up at the Inn in front of the border into Wern@@ stein .
in Wern@@ stein the cross @-@ border is generally high in the course .
the bridge @-@ firmly linked with the Bav@@ arian neighbours on Sunday after@@ elli@@ g , day before a two @-@ brid@@ ging athle@@ tic - organized by the Union Wern@@ stein and Bayern from Neu@@ kirchen .
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án would now send further tens of thousands , is a logical result of a seem@@ ing policy :
instead of helping in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately for the establishment of structures , our Chancellor , our German Chancellor , has officially opened up and openly the position of the Hungarian government in the dark @-@ state of the National Soci@@ alism .
Lei@@ den@@ portable this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now facing in the border areas with cha@@ otic states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the vessels have to realize that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; praised country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they invited and welcome , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a great challenge , given the continuing refugee streams and of the w@@ inter@@ ing winter , to establish decent conditions for protection seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there will be even greater peace , security , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in Search of 35.@@ 000 w@@ inter@@ fixed Qu@@ arti@@ eren
Konrad has all hands full with the refugee camps .
Christian Konrad is it used to have his Word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen @-@ ban@@ kers to release qu@@ arti@@ s for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first drill centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already been able to get a grip on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported of his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who had come on Monday to Austria were without a great tur@@ mo@@ il , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the State Department spoke on the other hand of a &quot; cr@@ atic situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad can anticip@@ ate with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 qu@@ arti@@ ers in a hy@@ per year .
in order to meet the number , will have to be found 35.@@ 000 accommodations in the next weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries 15,@@ 000 of the federal government .
should there be more refugees , we can make it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a hat@@ red without ground &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the local politicians he already had interviews .
they promised to be assured , even for the coming refugees to be tor@@ so .
&quot; in Ober@@ österreich it works well , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Maier .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Car@@ dinal Christoph Scho@@ born , in doing so it shall be un@@ solved , as the Church will help .
great expectations will continue to put asylum coordin@@ ator also into the OR@@ F action &apos; Hel@@ ping as we . &quot;
on the platform you can easily offer accommodation .
furthermore , one hopes on hotels that are empty in winter .
Konrad and Maier critic@@ ized yesterday the standards for accommodation as a &quot; very high . &quot;
in not@@ aries , it could not be that qu@@ arti@@ s must appro@@ ve a certain height of hand @-@ holders or size of the light structure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a long @-@ term time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; need@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that he is even more successful in contrast to the House of Foreign Affairs , Konrad with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , which you do not say without further into the face of truth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Maier the Republic does not cause any costs as they explained .
your employees want to increase it from three to four .
his own Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ look was not yet successful .
Konrad wanted to put a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with the approval .
Linz calls for a better division
first , there is no opening of municipal Spor@@ th@@ allen and other buildings such as Tips Arena and Design Center for accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , because those affected can not take place without these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but for the emergency , however , further sites should be tested for their di@@ pl@@ ine .
criticism of the Board &apos;s commission puts the division of refugees within the state of the country .
other areas also must contribute to their contribution .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not sealed
in a longer telephone @-@ car with the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) announced on Monday the further action in the refugee problem .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer gave me assur@@ ances that the German borders are not sealed .
continuing education of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany remain possible .
however , there will now be the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special ov@@ als with refugees to Germany for the first time .
but the exam@@ ining would however have brought to Germany with regular gul@@ ps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ s even called for greater solidarity in the refugee demand . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that now Austria has entered its borders with controls again , for P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of the procedure of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new ship@@ yard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industry is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group , S &amp; T is set up , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is intended to be rented to young , innovative businesses from the technological area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT we are the smart heads our raw material - and we have to attempt to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine to invest in the new ship@@ yard in the new ship@@ yard , and later on to compete .
right from the start S &amp; T aims to co @-@ operate with the new neighbours - where low @-@ in @-@ house promises well : &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is only a matter of time . &quot;
1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the premises , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to a third of the city Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is respected by the Linz AG for 60 years on S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meter area in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent give it requests .
L@@ ia @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second shop in the arcade
in the new shop Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags stand at the center .
actually , Jutta wanted to put a dog in Jutta .
this project had to have had the 49 @-@ year anniversary of L@@ ia Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ be market arc@@ ades short @-@ cut and up@@ push : finally , she has now got a growth in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the business , in which they sold under different po@@ ckets , suit@@ cases , shoes and gar@@ ages of various manufacturers , all of which are all about D@@ amen@@ hand@@ bags of the mark Fur@@ la , w@@ allet can be from 75 euros .
larger bag and accessories costs up to 500 Euro .
since yesterday the new shop is in use .
it has been modified for several weeks ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long over , whether I want to open a store , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says wide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was among other things , that also the Fur@@ la @-@ producers who are in Bologna at home , from the idea of an own location where only their hand@@ bags are sold .
&quot; we are the se@@ ater in the Gre@@ ater Linz that sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has its own Italian roots .
her fashion interest has been wide from her mother to the cradle .
I do@@ cked on most when something develops and I can show new trends at full prices .
why so some woman under the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in ench@@ ant@@ ment , the professional woman can not answer with the latter security .
maybe it is because a beautiful bag is called every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ lj@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the parish of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called an@@ is@@ lators .
this property also combines man@@ di@@ vers with the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for puri@@ fier .
whether he expresses alien@@ able , journalists , or concerns , or knowledge into the international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. presidential policy has been boo@@ sted its election campaign .
and cuts well in doing so .
this is also registered in the pf@@ alz K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the property @-@ milli@@ ard@@ ant origin@@ ate .
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is a term thanks to the Win@@ zer@@ dorf at the wine road .
man@@ cher in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ site is about -@@ zig corners with it is related .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ ine : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election campaign .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do vill@@ agers think about his aim to become more powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think that is somehow thrilling , but are not so deeply impressed by their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the cur@@ ved c@@ all@@ ergy has shot a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous st@@ ubs , to which besides Tr@@ ump also the Ket@@ ch@@ up Family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump that is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also towards words - so with the statement that he would surely also be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he has not brought it to the king of hearts .
although there was respect for the performance of the family , but also ten@@ den@@ zi@@ el the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; is a bit of a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inci@@ dentally the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ lj@@ es@@ etter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - too heavy @-@ German : the an@@ is@@ lators , says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump is thus from the village of an@@ is@@ lators .
the tr@@ ump of success story began in 18@@ 85 , when the later grandfather had mig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gol@@ f@@ ters .
basic stone of the property corporation were first landed property in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of trag@@ ics : their desire to return to the country , fails on the Bav@@ arian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump because he may be dism@@ issed once without a permit , the director of the Institute of pf@@ alz History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , joined the film .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal immig@@ rant &quot; .
this stands in contrast to the previous statements of after@@ ward .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and claimed the construction of a border wall to throw illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as the pol@@ ish , this is not as sympath@@ etic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relatives ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gran@@ ny was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born @-@ born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the winery in retirement sees the Americans rather dis@@ soci@@ ate , &quot; he is always so intense . &quot;
believe he that Tr@@ ump comes ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he never looked after K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension in Veronika Sch@@ ramm mentioned like man@@ cher K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz with a visit something for the church organ ended , which was generally well an@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine the Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they f@@ ade it better if he did not win the choice , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had at the time of his grandfather in the US had had the same way he had , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grapes are also ready without the President of Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , for the Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , have seen 12 000 movie singers , even in the US awak@@ ens the interest .

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star of documentary &apos; to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama over a recently @-@ wit@@ ched father , who decides to settle down with his two children from the New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million spect@@ ators .
critics were asked if Thom@@ son could have a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening she rep@@ lied with a clear &quot; yes . &quot;
the X @-@ Factor von Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spect@@ ators and hit light The Block ( 83@@ 8,@@ 000 ) and T@@ BL Family ( 7@@ 26,@@ 000 ) .

the final three agree on : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret un@@ covered ? ...
Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have w@@ ingly ignor@@ ant who The Bachelor wins .
the woman , at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor , finally lan@@ det , was wr@@ apped in the greatest secret .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not award if they are the one who has received the last rose .
but when we were with Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three two , you might possibly be acci@@ dentally give a reference to who the vic@@ t@@ ress will be .
Sam Wood holds his lips up to the final on Thursday Vol . 1
all three women have left themselves in a ly@@ rical way , why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is posed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should receive the last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could , their answers to play , who won the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki no@@ ons both quickly - except for themselves - Mack@@ ay as the best partner for wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other on the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and ( Sar@@ ah ) and His energies noticed , I felt that they were fairly compatible and I was thinking about it throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is talking with both feet on the earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; she added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be good as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , Mack@@ ay said that the Haus@@ er last week you realized that Wood &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally set on him , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked whom Wood should choose if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say , &quot; she said .
I love the left @-@ like girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
the Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 pm , on Ten .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his NF@@ L career .
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in moving into the US - and there were many other teams that were sent after his impressive training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a clever decision .
some trainers would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank as he lost a bar@@ angel so he did the Aussie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League League at his first p@@ unt return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Min@@ nes@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a p@@ unt return and also to the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of h@@ iring his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team by the mill he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne also publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ re@@ porter was reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams , Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who ri@@ et him to forget his scr@@ at@@ ched catch and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a p@@ unt , which was restored in the first slot of Min@@ nes@@ ota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive austr@@ al@@ ous poem for his NF@@ L de@@ buted .
Hay@@ ne , nach dem F@@ um@@ ble flu@@ ch@@ end das Spiel@@ feld and spoke later the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy at 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not imagine a bad start into his NF@@ L career .
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that is it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne .
Hay@@ ne en@@ cro@@ pped the wheels with his Orig@@ in debut at that time in 2007 , when a pass was carried out in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area to a Tr@@ y for Queensland .
overall it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

the Free voters demand the h@@ iring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria for the high wave of refugees in Bavaria .
party and leader Hubert Ai@@ w@@ anger began at the beginning of the DM @-@ Aut@@ umn on a serious crisis in front of a severe crisis at Bay@@ erns schools , when there is no new teacher for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to preserve the schools off the collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger .
&quot; otherwise we will get ship@@ ments in the Bav@@ arian education system . &quot;
the landscap@@ ing fac@@ tion of the Free voters are h@@ unted to Friday in the under@@ going commun@@ e .
actually , quite other main themes were envis@@ aged .
but the record number of refugees also domin@@ ates the free voters meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lap the cl@@ ause , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ w@@ anger called for the establishment of UN protective zones for refugees in Syria , as there were wars in the 19@@ 50s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we will not go ahead , we need to get to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Free voters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
off @-@ off asylum seek@@ ers , the Free voters want to de@@ port as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore Ai@@ w@@ anger also requested more staff for the administrative courts , who are responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least fifty new asylum seeker , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the FW leader critic@@ ized that several Bundes@@ länder does not consistently be consistently : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bre@@ w nation@@ wide united standards of the Bundes@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria moves away , others not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must be able to act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the provincial policy in big wall@@ city should not fall under the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a years of permanent apparatus remains on the agenda : the education policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the new school year , K@@ ult@@ us@@ minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) had started on the pilot &apos;s &quot; Inter@@ medi@@ ate plus &quot; after a pro@@ long@@ ation of the gymn@@ ast@@ al intermediate stage of three to four years - in the outcome it will take nine years to the S@@ LC .
however , this is not far enough .

fir@@ mer Wall Street helps D@@ ax on the jumps
the German stock market has concluded after a wide range of routes , lo@@ op@@ ed and nerv@@ ous commercial use .
only in the afternoon a fixed bu@@ rial of the US @-@ stock exchanges for a clear direction that the D@@ ax was ultimately up to 10 percent to 10 18@@ 8,@@ 13 points towards the top .
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized values gained 39 percent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points .
the Techn@@ ological el@@ astic Tec@@ DA@@ X rose by 19 percent to 17@@ 36,@@ 69 points .
the Euro@@ Sto@@ xx 50 is the leading index of the euro zone cut by 20 percent to 320@@ 7,@@ 60 points .
sound profits also betra@@ yed the trade magazines in London and Paris .
in the United States the D@@ ow @-@ Jones has finally seen some 1 percent in the plus .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen rubber bul@@ lets in Nepal shoot
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal after the police scre@@ ened in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said a Beam@@ ter on Wednesday .
the violence broke down in the district of R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi District , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , Chief District , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators were gathered outside of a police station , with some of them bri@@ cks and fire bom@@ bs war@@ ves .
Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said the police have used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and then shot in the air before they are held on rubber bul@@ lets .
20 Poli@@ zi@@ sten and five civilians were inju@@ red , he rehear@@ sed .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets , known from those who cannot kill , but that are traditionally used as less deadly alternative , apparently such a high death rate .
the dispute was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nep@@ als southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ adh@@ esi say that new provinces to be formed within the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence .
there were protests in the western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Th@@ ol@@ ocation , who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officer , were in violent conflicts since the 10 .
August killed , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country in provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally governed by centuries .
working on a new constitution since 2008 has been on its path , but the legisl@@ ator acceler@@ ated the process after the devast@@ ating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April .
the leg@@ is@@ lators who voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the Constitu@@ tional accus@@ ation in Kathmandu and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .

Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market some 4000 square meters of land in direct proximity to the youth centre of the Old Post .
the preparations for this are currently running .
the site is planned to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commercial and well @-@ being .
you wait for appropriate offers , it is on the part of the city .
which investor @-@ query will come , be not yet clear .

the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is on the ring road / corner Great street , already bought a few months ago and allow the building to be carried away .
project H@@ ieve : details lie on the table
the plans for the holiday homes in the Small Sea at Em@@ den take shape .

Mon@@ el@@ ang was behind closed doors , green belt , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new B &amp; B is set aside in the small sea near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the interested , medium @-@ sized capital of the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System building &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; presented its plans for the first time in the assembly line by the Em@@ den Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally , this point on the non @-@ public part of the agenda was stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; under the pressure of the project cr@@ itic and the F@@ DP group , which war@@ med the investor and administration sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf B@@ ehr@@ ends from the system construction management in the offensive : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not yet have an answer to all questions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however it was good to be able to address all rum@@ ors now .
the projects around ten to twelve million Euros have been in discussion for months in the discussion .
severe reactions among sea@@ water poss@@ essing who had come to the meeting , called the pictures and new details of the desired hotel building .
Roberto Schulz , marine land@@ owner and board member of the interests of the An@@ lieg@@ er , Pro H@@ ieve , l@@ aments : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ utter@@ er that over@@ looks all the other bi@@ kers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , he fears as many other project leaders that the traffic would increase through the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be entire bus lad@@ ders so that counts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is exactly about the well a h@@ ect@@ are of the former Gast@@ stätte , but is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we must have a conclusi@@ ve concept &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ralf B@@ ehr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was not yet missing , the development plans are still variable .

Google will start double @-@ in donations to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . o ) announced a dou@@ bling debt campaign to help thousands of refugees trying to aid the thousands of refugees who handed over the European nations , since they were fle@@ e from the war of tor@@ n and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of the donation call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager to leave the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google assistant who is escap@@ ed with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old and her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our journey there were many dark railway and bus trips , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as the refugee and migrants crisis grew up in Europe , many people like my family are des@@ perate for help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google said that the first globally accum@@ ulated donations has doubled up to a value of 5.5 million at a number of $ 11 million . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has sold more than 4 million people this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many fle@@ e from the war against Afghanistan , Y@@ emen , Iraq and Libya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reporting by Yas@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; editing of Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
for light @-@ overweight di@@ ab@@ etics , weight can be more likely to be beneficial .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for a new study at least five years .
it is still too early to say whether easily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the death data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , which wrote a editorial to the new study in J@@ ama Surgery .
weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of mag@@ nit@@ ude .
they reduce hunger and limit the physical capacity to include food .
over the years , obesity operations have proved efficient for treating type @-@ 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are path@@ ological f@@ ett@@ y with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , some degree of weight regarding size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I above 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Data , which they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obesity surgery - Mag@@ ni@@ b@@ yp@@ ass and Mag@@ en@@ schl@@ au@@ ch@@ bildung - zu Medical treatments for type @-@ 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those who under@@ went this operation declined from 31 to 24,@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile the BM@@ I remained with those who were not @-@ surgical diabetes treatments roughly equal to 29 .
those who under@@ went a surgical procedure is quite un@@ used at 36 % the diabetes @-@ condition completely and in 28 % .
in the medic@@ ally treat@@ able group , in comparison with diabetes , only by one percent and in part , only about two percent .
in addition , the results with the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; found the authors out .
the researchers also monitoring the patient @-@ blood levels of Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c that reflects the blood sugar levels throughout the period .
Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is best held below 7 per cent , then write the researcher .
after the surgery the average Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level declined by about 9 percent to about 6 percent .
in the medical treatment group there remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as you do in the improved ha@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level - decreased not dimin@@ ishing the mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compare the average results with the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year the b@@ yp@@ ass surgery @-@ group lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching bigger decl@@ ines in the BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 against 5.1 ) and Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2,@@ 1 % ) and reported rather a total overcoming of the Diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16,@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit of the surgery , after five years , there are evidence from a study of he@@ avier persons in Sweden , that operation leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was under@@ fed by obesity , overweight surgery , about 29 per cent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that conventional methods was tried .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgery @-@ patient , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I below 35 , who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without raised the risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long before we take people to take this seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once they accum@@ ulated these genetic changes that have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes is a revers@@ al really hard . &quot;
love @-@ story plays at H@@ uns@@ rück

&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ news
Europe cannot take all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and imp@@ lied that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East said .
the Tibetan @-@ Buddh@@ ist leaders urged to end the violence in the local countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of its ten @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , which is dedicated to ethics @-@ studies .
he ordered that under certain circumstances the interests of humanity should be asked before the interests of individual nations , or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries is ad@@ mi@@ red to the refugee crisis but the situation is not adequate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the Dalai Lama &apos;s Dalai Lama and Austria &apos;s efforts to address the crisis , he stressed that there is only a temporary solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , like a real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we must think about how the k@@ ill@@ ings is reduced in their countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; he added .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack from September 11 , and turned out that the violent reaction of the US moved a chain of un@@ control@@ l@@ able events .
after September 11 , I have expressed my conf@@ ess in a letter to President Bush , and said to him , the way to resol@@ ving this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he set violence and this has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of intake of hand@@ cancer inf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the past 4 years
Gi@@ ft@@ Control@@ s in the USA report about almost 400 @-@ pro@@ cent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , which conce@@ al a heavily traff@@ ics inf@@ ect@@ ant , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord , Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , ending the cases of income of manual inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years , reporting the tox@@ ins control centers , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are becoming more common in these products , and sadly a percentage of them go in the recording , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants are purpos@@ ely to drink while some do it to impress their friends or because of an MU@@ T@@ PRO@@ BE in social media .
show videos on YouTube , how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants can only drink because of a cheap memory .
young people have supp@@ os@@ edly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ resistant mou@@ th@@ wash to get a tough@@ er drink .
younger children can be driven by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child doesn &apos;t think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those that are frag@@ mented .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with stra@@ wberry , grapes and orange juice , which are very pleas@@ ing for children .
Hän@@ de@@ des@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially at inf@@ ants can already lead few sy@@ ring@@ es to alcohol in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ not@@ ions in the hospital of K@@ ans@@ as , the Sender Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would not let nowhere to be whis@@ ky whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and if children come to it , then it is a fast way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently taken four dri@@ ps of after stra@@ wberry smell from the hand@@ shake inf@@ ect@@ ant in school was taken into a p@@ act of treatment .
your blood pressure concentration was 179 , twice higher than the thres@@ hold , which is legally qualified by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a not@@ ch @-@ doctor who acted in the G@@ winn@@ ings Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ om@@ it her words and wasn &apos;t able to go as she came in the recording .
doctors pract@@ ised they overnight in a separate children &apos;s disease house for signs of deer @-@ trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen through alcohol and had pushed the head said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ affir@@ s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has to use parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and to store on hand san@@ iti@@ zer outside the reach of the child .
about alcohol in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation were some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants associated with deaths .
in 2013 two women were killed in Ontario women after the end of hanging infectious diseases that contained an toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suppose that the product meth@@ anol contained , a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ yl@@ alcohol which was not@@ ated as an active ingredient .
in January , three pupils of the fourth Class in the state of New York , their &quot; reported by a &quot; teacher &quot; by laying down anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; thus announces a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to shoulder @-@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and calls them out of their space .
the police considered the ver@@ tic@@ ated plan as a &quot; g@@ ossi@@ p &quot; and trans@@ discipl@@ ined actions to the school of school .

the former ranking @-@ middle @-@ player and former national players of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because there is no title @-@ Riv@@ ality with the leader@@ ers .
de Bo@@ er , currently a amb@@ assador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here do not only talk about the return of the leader@@ boards .
they are talking about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
there are a lot of tension in the Old Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ pt h@@ la .
R@@ onny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian boss v@@ owed to turn things about .
after the defeat of Malm@@ ö and the subsequent exp@@ editions of the Champions League followed the defeat of 10 @-@ man from super@@ st@@ itions , which are now at the top of the table now with five points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; But Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic did not have bad times before and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel it as well - but we have to go on .
we really need the support from Celtic because that makes the players better .
now we all together is so important .

in the meantime , employment was in Scotland by 12,@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,@@ 000 .
the employment rate for Scotland was in the course of the quarter to 7@@ 4.@@ 0 per cent - a number above the UK @-@ average of 7@@ 3,5 percent .
the Perman@@ ent Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented the latest figures and said , &quot; The long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year that Scotland has made the historic decision to stay part of the UK .
during these 12 months we have experienced further improvements to the Scottish labour market , with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment .
dr@@ un@@ ken bot@@ her@@ ed the process
because security guards the location was not pre@@ free@@ ze , the employees called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray , the officers could take the stur@@ geon in cust@@ ody .
a breath of alcohol sur@@ rendered by a 16 @-@ year old should be propor@@ le .

why I will be witn@@ essing an Ex@@ ec@@ ution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a bit later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will evaluate how a man is brought to death .
if it happens , and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator @-@ gallery in the death @-@ chamber in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p will be executed by the tox@@ ins .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation took place for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed .
when the day came closer I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a great way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists must be seen in the US and there are often more applic@@ ants available as places available , an exhau@@ stive lot@@ tery instead of decide to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who will be chosen will make it in@@ valuable .
I cannot do that .
I will sit down next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps at a small friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone numbers and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we lau@@ gh a lot if we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pin to record what I see .
I simply have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prison@@ er , as it will , and you will get access .
I restrict myself to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she ad@@ mits that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been better artic@@ ulate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it still thinks that it is wrong that I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problems with some of the things I said and written .
he does not tell me what I have to write and I would not do it even if he would do it .
I said to him that he may remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants that a international re@@ porter is present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement against death will help the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a rep@@ atri@@ ots of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is next to me sitting .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have done .
here I don &apos;t want to go down here again for all details .
I can &apos;t agree with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is inno@@ cent .
his acts after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty to be a benefici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ eli@@ hood is that it is not guilty of the murder .
I &apos;m sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death section .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can not claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porter that you can apply for this .
what you will get from me is what it says , a man ought to die of an unnecessary death .
man after dam@@ p police @-@ ad@@ owing , to come from the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry , when he reason@@ ed the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
an attempt of a man of Perth to hang out the police , was un@@ successful when he removed himself in the sil@@ ken and sw@@ amp@@ y water , who tried to persu@@ ade him sof@@ tly , to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was founded on Tuesday to a peaceful quar@@ ry in Beck@@ enh@@ am .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them towards Cann@@ ing River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I come not out , kom@@ m and hol , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine .
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ hav@@ ec was not too enthusiastic about making its Uni@@ form wet , so he turned into a reliable tactics - &quot; A good polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes people funny things to try to escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
champion @-@ German player Ben Cous@@ in offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 she was driving c@@ ous@@ ins in the dit@@ ch to escape a alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben &apos;s c@@ ous@@ ins .
Peter Moo@@ dy maintains that ste@@ wards sought to pro@@ voke him , and threat@@ ens to end racing sport
Peter Moo@@ dy maintains that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria have tried to install a sp@@ y in its st@@ ables last year and thre@@ w the race immediately .
he represented on the ste@@ wards and the Integ@@ rit@@ ter department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she carried out a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last St@@ roh@@ hal@@ m on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing sport and he found himself under difficult circumstances , when it was about the positive cob@@ alt @-@ tre@@ ach@@ ment tasting at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
he had with@@ held 18 months because of the sp@@ ying pro@@ sp@@ ices and didn &apos;t want it to be &quot; out like too high bun@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; I had to say nothing to say about this , and I have long been eating , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything is coming out again , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .
you know that it continues .
sometimes you have to react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to um@@ my head down , and I want my owners think that I am trying my best for her .
if they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be more trainers .
I then have to think what I do with my license .
previously Moo@@ dy played the bom@@ b in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the Integ@@ rit@@ er department had tried to absor@@ b his stable .
&quot; before eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry Ter@@ ry , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart in a room with a man - whom I &apos;ll be asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ alls , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com
but they obviously believe that I am a sc@@ amm@@ ers .
if that is the case , they should certainly put into their n@@ oses , because they attempt to hold me into account .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ die , acting president of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the RV@@ L , were aware of this time and still are today .
should I think that it is personally going to be ?
does the RV@@ L conduct itself and makes people responsible outside instruc@@ tors what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there that I am .
perhaps they must take my license and stum@@ ble me , and I don &apos;t have any doubt that what I say , it is happening right now .
but I arrived at the point on which this doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
I will push the pressure on them , and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ stration levels of the trainer have been built with the long @-@ lasting Kob@@ alt @-@ investigation in Li@@ dar@@ i and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to him that he could throw his license on the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for its preparation of the un@@ ador@@ ned Master Caviar , reve@@ aling the racing tags for treatment &quot; ridic@@ ulous &quot; after a pack of mud or sound had been applied to the horse deb@@ ating , what is viol@@ ated against the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has er@@ ron@@ eous conclusions on the B@@ ein .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it would have been so yesterday the whole day that was so .
it had also been so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month di@@ quali@@ fication for treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set these rules don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you go too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes against ri@@ vals due to alleg@@ ations of ring @-@ fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy did criticism of the tac@@ kling of his players as an &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rator won the Storm players &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying finale in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Ben@@ nett made a few disgu@@ ised note to the Storm team , having obtained the final victory against North Queensland Cow@@ boy on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; Mu@@ ster@@ ile &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two of Queensland did not be too good &quot; in rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the tor@@ ch of his crew and said that they are concentrated only on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading co@@ aches to his crew tac@@ kl@@ ed him hop@@ eful as it wre@@ cks that they were worried about being struck by the Storm team .
&quot; this appears again and again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson am@@ id@@ ed about Ring@@ kä@@ mpfe said to us 24 : 2 be@@ aten , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that in the whole year , we have nothing changed at our opposite system or techniques . but over the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ cles on a real focus and that has been provided for us the lac@@ emaking process .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to lose so it was a little shock for him .
it is already funny as this is always up to this season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy idea attacked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and his ment@@ or reminded that Ben@@ net@@ ts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra had won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Way@@ ne is talking about exciting football .
he was compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was a boring team , and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of a she@@ ath .
but now he has a team to play this and which we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt for playing them .
I have increased confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about us to play against us .
six weeks ago they probably did not think of us when the Big Games went .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ sters a higher result achieved than the game Bron@@ cos against Cow@@ boy .
the game of Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game , but is it an exciting game ?
or are Pau@@ sen doing and do not make any points a gri@@ pping ?
for me it is the sched@@ ules .
when they mention us , it means that we will be meeting on them in a phase .
the Storm team has free this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cow@@ boy or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday evening at the A@@ AMI Park next Saturday . the ticket office will start starting next morning .
Ser@@ bier with $ 200,000 up to Dru@@ gs K@@ age
a man who could possibly have a lifetime punishment , because of his experiment , in the possession of 40 k@@ ilo@@ grams co@@ ca@@ ine , which were b@@ lown to Queensland , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men arrested the last month after the Federal Police took 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and put in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he met his fellow @-@ accused in the yacht harbour during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Ro@@ adh@@ ouse , where the police found 40 k@@ ilo@@ grams of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite having a possibly viable punishment for attemp@@ ting to possess a commercial volume co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the attorney of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , that there may be no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café could have been out of an harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the cur@@ se of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the prison , he put the police on his place of residence .
Mak@@ si@@ veness &apos;s mother and a step@@ father held a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together in order to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the tender explanations of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of a safety of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jud@@ ge &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent it from performing it , war@@ n it .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against deposit , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and his Ser@@ b passport , announces itself daily in the police and sat down at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

the prosec@@ ut@@ ch E@@ ili@@ dh Rober@@ ts@@ on said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a ad@@ diction that he is ad@@ dic@@ tive to scar@@ ce people .
he gave to that the seek@@ ers were carried out on the computer of him , but said it had happened because he wanted to claim a polic@@ eman to scar@@ ce a polic@@ y@@ ile .
he was asked for his conversation with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send even more photos .
he said that he did so to enti@@ ce them .
he said he is sick in my head , if he inst@@ inct , and said , he wants to see the images of rape and murder .
Ms Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was at the tre@@ mb@@ ling and at the cr@@ ying .
she also saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confront@@ ing the accused .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused did use computer and players to speak to girls who looked much younger than he had .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five @-@ meter cell are deser@@ ted
the Federal Constitu@@ tional Court has given to a ex @-@ det@@ ention of the n@@ avi@@ ary of the dy@@ nasty , which was accommod@@ ated by mon@@ el@@ ang in one to small cell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the violation of its dignity , prisoners have to be entitled to financial compensation , when they remain in small cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this had decided the Tribunal of the Federal Constitu@@ tional Court in one on Wednesday .
suffer@@ ers may even hope for money if they were blocked only a few days in the too tight spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
in this way an ex @-@ H@@ äf@@ t@@ ling was successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in the judicial prison Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with approximately five @-@ square meters floor space ; the toil@@ ette was non @-@ separated .
after that , the man , who is now on an un@@ interrupted on the grounds of his rule , into a larger cell .
his am@@ t@@ sh@@ af@@ ary ar@@ rest due to the un@@ worthy defence conditions against the land of Berlin prev@@ ailed .
but the Constitu@@ tional Court took away the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al in Berlin and will refer the case to the renewed examination .
they see the man boobs would hurt .
Kammer@@ Court now decides on level of compensation
even if for legal reasons from the frag@@ ile period only a few days of haf@@ tt@@ age may be decisive for compensation , be an equi@@ voc@@ al , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be to fear a w@@ aging of the legal protection of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ al must now clarify the height of the dent@@ ure@@ ments .
the Constitu@@ tional Court has often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
so they spoke first in April of a prison@@ er dem@@ nity , because he was naked in a cell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 , according to the multi @-@ specialist of a cell without a separate toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also confirmed on Wednesday in addition to the Berlin Constitu@@ tional Court , who had agreed to an in@@ mate in a Parall@@ el@@ fall in November 2009 .
the dam@@ al pic@@ ion was lod@@ ged over three months daily between 15 and 21 hours in the same cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons have come into the head@@ lines in the last few weeks as well .
that is why prisoners are always included in 23 hours , the aggressi@@ veness rises , even to s@@ laughter it is due to the ten@@ se situation already come .
according to the information of the Just@@ in@@ press@@ est@@ elle , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied , 19 shall proceed to 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
approximately 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers , after forecasts for the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Germany shall come to Germany following a statement by Vice @-@ Chancellor S@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated with the un@@ common challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this , and we can create that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
they are used for different forecasts between 35@@ 0000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Pest@@ el Institute ) apartments annually - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is the lack of living space , but above all in large rent properties : every year 600@@ 00 @-@ 800@@ 00 social apartments are out of the rental price , and the particularly favourable apartments are also submitted to refugees .
Bundes@@ minist@@ ered Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants therefore to double the promotion , from currently 518 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the Pest@@ el Institute : 80 000 social apartments would have to arise and for this , the federal government should invest an increase in the amount of 6.4 billion per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of scientists and the federal government agreed that there must also be more tax benefits to investment in housing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the estimates of the Institute for labour market research and vocational research , it is estimated that over the long term , 55 percent of the p@@ oul@@ try in Germany can be inv@@ ali@@ d .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be asked closely after their qualifications to help them find critic@@ ised Claudia Walter , project man@@ ag@@ ress for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the integration of refugees is crucial if they find work in Germany .
labour is the key to social contacts , for the esteem in respect of society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , the migration researcher Diet@@ rich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political revers@@ al : from the Labour offered for refugees to recognition of labour .
while there was an employment ban for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , that was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just as the resi@@ dences , the asylum seek@@ ers is restricted to a place of residence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society - also because of the shortage of skilled labour - a majority of our vision which should allow refugees to increase their access to the labour market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing German .
so far there is still no exhau@@ stive offer of general and user @-@ related language courses .
studies also show that jobs are often linked through personal contacts .
the build of networks is therefore under the view of Thr@@ än@@ hardt the König@@ s@@ weg for the work integration .
the Berlin school administration has established that few refugees give their children to the Kit@@ une , estimated at ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the root @-@ rooted parents , it is only quite important to hold the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ sch@@ ema , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family nonetheless from the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management of manual paper distributed in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators desc@@ ending through the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the apprentic@@ eship , by increasing more specialist schools .
in the countries , pupils are prepared without a knowledge of welcome in welcome groups .
but they are not always taught by fully trained instruc@@ tors and teachers , but also as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
in them there is no shortage , says Be@@ ate St@@ suit@@ case , from the Berlin executive administration .
the German Stud@@ enten@@ werk will be estimated that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no Bundes@@ land asylum seek@@ ers or Ged@@ ul@@ ated the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , In@@ sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its position .
studying : refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for refugees with a re@@ im@@ bur@@ sement or rest@@ ation do not receive any services after asylum seek@@ ers more , when they begin studying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter are fundamentally no BA@@ Fö@@ G as they don &apos;t fall under the circle of the disabled people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patient refugees had to have lived in Germany so far for four years to be eligible for BA@@ Fö@@ G , from 1 January 2016 to shor@@ ten this margin to 15 months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also this funding gap must be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Ber@@ lins Under@@ secret@@ ary for Science , and the German Stud@@ enten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
Islam will play a more important role in future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should indu@@ ce Islam succ@@ essi@@ vely the same rights as they have the churches , and continue to develop the existing state @-@ church law to a new state of religions .
important would also be the foundation of a Muslim welfare association , which takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
among the rights are also obligations .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on a clear contact person and be ready to cooperate with the state in many fields and give it certain control options .
this also includes willingness to set up against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , voic@@ ed on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany .
those who wanted to have such conflicts in Germany have immediately their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; said in Bay@@ rische Rundfunk .
he suggested to translate the Basic Law on Arab .
integration will continue to be a topic of the whole society in future .
this will also change the majority of society , the reduction of discrimination and racism is urgent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - for a decade &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ discrimination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a gender equality law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is slow to learn how the NS@@ U M@@ ord@@ atur@@ a series attracted , in the police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist mot@@ if .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and stakeholders have long been calling for international agreements such as the anti @-@ racial configur@@ ations in Germany must become reality in the next few years , if the country is peaceful and its new citizens should take advantage of their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany was able to provide medic@@ ally previously anticipated refugees , Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what affects Man@@ - Power and capacities , we create that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the necessary money will flow into the system for this .
to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , calls for Mont@@ gom@@ ery , to equi@@ p all com@@ ers immediately during the registration of health cards .
the achievements could be p@@ ayed later with the Bundes@@ länder .
and in the long run , it is highly question@@ able , so many people are subject to food demand that the asylum application is subject to asylum .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , we are doing the doctors before all the language barriers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before now , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are dec@@ eived by their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical offices , would have to be taken over interpre@@ ter , she demands .
a lot of refugees would be helped , but also with more gener@@ aliz@@ ations in emergency terms .
and with another diagnostic view .
under refugee crisis , there are some more un@@ ob@@ struc@@ tive disability , and for the young people I go to HIV education .
with the partly other cases of disease , German doctors from their training would be clear , however , says Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ it@@ ism or tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not as difficult to recognize , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as regards the resent@@ ment if the refugees can be possibly even lin@@ dri@@ an in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans had a highly developed education system , several refugees can be even doctors .
to practice , however , they must demonstrate their qualifications and dis@@ solve tests .
at least half of the refugees in Germany in@@ coming refugees is sick after estimates of the application psych@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) mentally ill : most suffer from a post@@ injury test disorder or among depression .
particularly vulnerable , refugee ry , explains Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study of the TU Munich proves that every fifth , Syrian refugee is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who are incur@@ red by a post @-@ trau@@ mati@@ zation disorder is suffering from among other things on the so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with respir@@ atory , Sch@@ win@@ del , Herz@@ r@@ asen and death .
further symptoms are ins@@ om@@ nia and concentration @-@ disorders , strong fri@@ ction and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms of chronic , be a earliest treatment required , Mun@@ z explained .
so far , only four percent of the psych@@ isch kran@@ ken refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy .
although psychological sick asylum seek@@ ers in the social conditions may pose a application for a psych@@ otherapy , but the processing usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social seals , they would not be trained or doctors who are not trained for the mental illness , decide whether treatment is necessary or not .
this is often lead to fail@@ ures , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites for dre@@ aming
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new st@@ aging &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Cir@@ cus was getting back on the traditions of Cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to educate any age group in the batch of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , veter@@ inary and unique entertainment .
now the cir@@ cus loads in the Man@@ ege on the tiles , we@@ ases for dre@@ aming .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine , without my Cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephanie @-@ tried , animal instructor and junior orch@@ ard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this slogan is the current de@@ gener@@ acy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cir@@ cus has been proven in the hands of the family for over 33 years .
the gift to delight in the family is thus in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are important to take people away from their day @-@ day forward and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year junior orch@@ ard . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Man@@ goat cock@@ tail with world @-@ air &quot; , so the director shall be tried and tried his concept .
50 cities at the nearly 3 000 kilometres long tour can now experience this air .
the program of the cir@@ cus convinced with talented artists from around the world .
excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown family attracts the audience with w@@ it and charm in her spell .
even the Castillo Brothers understand their craft .
with the heroes of the fil@@ ming , it wants to take up the Cub@@ an Duo .
light@@ ness and mot@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art on the m@@ ast is to con@@ quer women &apos;s storm in the storm .
apart from numerous sal@@ mon @-@ sal@@ mon , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the cir@@ cus also proven with f@@ inger@@ tips and laughter .

for He Yuan no problem .
s@@ star@@ s@@ ly fascin@@ ate and sc@@ are at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics , like little other and int@@ ri@@ gu@@ ed with their mot@@ ility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stresses Steph@@ an@@ ies mother , Brigitte tried .
abuse in the attitude of cir@@ cus @-@ animals are only too often subject to various animal protection organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephanie tried also : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it does not go well in our animals , it does not work well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy a match .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ legged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it is lov@@ ingly called , will be read after every need from the eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
feel the animal not at ease , it does not want to get into the ring .
the top commandment is : good for the animals care .
specially designed for its zeb@@ ro@@ id Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ ot@@ hi@@ pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra stage , the family is tried .
the two animals have lived in a c@@ ages eight years and nothing has happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo is there , &quot; told Brigitte .
the zeb@@ ro@@ id is still not ready for the ring , but it &apos;s the unique mas@@ cot of the cir@@ cus .
so for every visitor it is likely to be something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephanie @-@ tasted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter whether five or 1 200 spect@@ ators , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cir@@ cus loads from 17 to 20 September daily at 17 and 8 pm at his performances .
Sunday will start the program at 11 and 16 o &apos;clock .

Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe puts wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s guide , fell down the steps at the beginning of the year .
he did not hurt , but the video of the case quickly became widespread about the social media .
the opening of the parliament was also told by claims of members of the opposition that they would have anonymous death dro@@ w@@ ings and they were warned that the consultation of Mr Mu@@ gabe was to be accompanied by Mr Mu@@ gabe .
last month they had extended him and interrupted him during his speech on the position of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent gon@@ ese said that seven Opp@@ os@@ u@@ itions received SMS messages on their phones which they war@@ n , Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ es Add@@ ress to distur@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but she did the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said journalists to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they warned the affected Parliament members that the imm@@ unity in parliament is ending , and once they leave the parliament , their parliamentary imm@@ unity is no longer effective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief said that from Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i guided tours is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to construct 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the framework of the restructuring and savings efforts in the services of the company .
HP will later expand into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected job market leads to a burden of over 2,@@ 7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair@@ woman and Chief Executive , who is to guide the unity after the separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it &apos;s HP today and we have a wide and deep@@ en portfolio of stores that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company we are better positioned than ever before , in order to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion US annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on the deployment so far @-@ integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; said an explanation of the company .
it was granted a company that was established in the 19@@ 30s by gradu@@ ates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce electr@@ o @-@ plants and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of the Sili@@ con Valley . &quot;
HP has passed a massive restructuring to tackle the turn of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturers and one of the biggest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area that is based on the belief that closely focused business will perform a better performance .
FC Arsenal Kap@@ itä@@ n Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates just have to stand in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger said to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and provided his rehabilitation after plan there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , its participation in the next summer is certainly still un@@ certain .
the great shame of this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had completed the last season after a separate k@@ ac@@ al injury and then had to return to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not harm the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone , who is not well cur@@ ved .
this is not a greater matter .
that was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his no@@ d@@ ules or with the injury that he had previously had .
this may be true of purely medical view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the per@@ tin@@ ent danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an uncomfortable pattern .
the investigation of Premier In@@ ju@@ ries Ltd is characterized by 23 different illnesses from Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 league in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for arsen@@ al is that they have been in six of eight games times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded most der@@ mat@@ ures .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the risk of injuries is in last season .
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a tricky time period , a time when you strengthen your body and win combat force , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zed , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
arsen@@ al begins his Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of games against Chelsea on Saturday and towards Tot@@ t@@ enh@@ am Hot@@ sp@@ ur on the coming Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger presents itself a rotation within the team .
Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not traveled to Croatia , which means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should be started .
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and players who need it to give a little break @-@ off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are to come through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Sta@@ dion in Zagreb belongs to the slots with the largest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ be@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; in@@ vin@@ ci@@ ble &quot; campaign was started during the last season .
the stadium was sh@@ attered on Tuesday evening by an earthquake , where the Lev@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3,@@ 7 were measured .
this year was the 10th place in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that arsen@@ al has drawn from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco and remains of the far hope , driven by his management the society to his first European ap@@ oc@@ al tri@@ umph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never folded in arsen@@ al .
we were very close to this in 2006 but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not a dre@@ amer .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show that has given us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for males to open themselves , now even dou@@ bt@@ ful than ever has become how self ass@@ ass@@ inated amongst young men on a 15 @-@ year fold .
in 2013 , it was the most important death of deaths in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ Health ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a her@@ ed@@ itary lifetime ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of putting culture into question , the men hin@@ ders it to seek help when they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to master this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms discovered that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthier mood , &quot; its chances for recovery .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of spiritual healthy friends are the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends to work with a friendship .
in the age of more than social media , communication , focusing on style on substance is the in@@ medi@@ ability of the response often more important than a significant contact .
our digital life have the need to be strong , life @-@ fun and successful , even if in reality domin@@ ates isolation .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologist extr@@ insi@@ c values call ; money , image , social status , everything at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper .
and as a video game @-@ invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently stated , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of friends was that this foc@@ uss@@ ing on the head was placed .
each character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality defined by interaction as a friend g@@ lit@@ tering .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler ho@@ od@@ ed hu@@ gs , moments while football comes into cosy arm@@ chairs and the longing for Ross to Rachel - all this came out of knowing that men can definitely stay abroad , even if they often fall back to explore completely their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like an employee of the telephone call , I explained : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; my audi@@ ences for people who feel de@@ pressed and put in danger , has really shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions between friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us is often not able to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come with it rightly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if you talk about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term uph@@ e@@ mechanisms .
it presents very clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status via phone to the men in moments of des@@ per@@ ation also may help the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you come to this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day totally newly established setting , why do not take your friends to have a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or even better if you &apos;re in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone can sit around with him , give it a smile and tell him hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent at Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the whole 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to be PSG , Malm@@ ö to break@@ down
angel Di Maria celeb@@ rates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani , after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and response to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course , when Paris Saint @-@ Germain launched its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prince @-@ park@@ on on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PSG players who made the French master on the way , but after that they missed a number of opportunities before they finally achieved their over@@ head when Cav@@ ani sco@@ red a head@@ light .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also needed a strong start against the Swedish master , as they do not only seek the qualification for the N.@@ O@@ .-@@ rounds but an improvement on its way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ alist in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , there was no real class of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ him@@ ov@@ ics missed opportunity in front of the gate . he later began in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association , with which he began his illustr@@ ates her career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to cause 2 : 0 to cause our opponents problems and relaxed back , even if there are certain things we need to perf@@ ected in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won even though I regret we have not yet sco@@ red one or two more goals . &quot;
I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which could hold a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided to hold its own place against Bordeaux in the first League , but was taken out in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argentin@@ ean refugees who was then referred to as the man who took over to the next stage in Europe when he ran into the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed to Johan Wil@@ and passed away beautifully in the long corner of the network .
if anyone believed that PSG would win a great win , that was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö that Celtic embedded in a play @-@ off in order to reach this level , joined the field at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national chess players on the field and was a heavy @-@ man batt@@ ling for a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola Dj@@ ur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passing far along the Kevin Tr@@ p P@@ fo@@ sten in the 34@@ th minute , they offered a little in the attack .
instead , there was at times sometimes on , with some mis@@ ses and poor performance , not least from I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , who was scr@@ at@@ ched with no less than five places in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless he dism@@ issed much more skill , when he brought his fellow @-@ players to the game , and it was a pass of I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , which turned into a shooting , which was cut down by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole .
the second gate finally fell short after the hour @-@ mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Uruguay sco@@ red his sixth seed after I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic had captured a left side of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö can return to the game , and only an excellent entrance from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to hold the end result before Re@@ player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi became a gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ eide , gave up to that PSG has played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said , &quot; Our last Champions League game was last year in December last year .
since then we played only in the Swedish league , which has not the same level .
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
check in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Matt Dam@@ on playing variety in film production
Matt Dam@@ on confront@@ ational the af@@ ro@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown on a discussion about the variety and said , she will not be needed behind the scenes .
during a result of Sunday night of H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light left the experienced actor Brown , as this stressed the need for alternative perspectives and indeed with regard to a black prot@@ agonist in the selected screen@@ play of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the cast of the film and not in the cast of the show , &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot;
brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked , with venti@@ l@@ ated un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! Wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian was arrested .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the Produ@@ zent@@ enk@@ ol@@ lie Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss about the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to urge people to think about it - whatever the director will be - how they treat the figure of harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown initially . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line that is be@@ aten by her white girl .
the producer of De@@ ar White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the direction of director &apos;s rights to the film . Dam@@ on resi@@ sted that their Director &quot; could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded against mis@@ endor@@ sement via Dam@@ on comments .
Twitter @-@ users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip , by wrote &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room so he can explain to their diversity - that is SO O@@ M@@ ON that hur@@ ts hur@@ ts . &quot;
the twe@@ et has served more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes for its release .
Dam@@ on comments come at a time when the precise racial representation in the media is at the top of the social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer , the movement of Black L@@ ves Mat@@ ter Ab@@ es@@ far achieved and urged law@@ makers and authorities to discrimin@@ ate discrimin@@ atory practices against color .
in February , the voc@@ alist Prince was made an attack on the movement during the introduction of the nominal albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; albums still Mat@@ ter &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
how books and black life , we still have their meaning .
in younger days , leader of the movement Black L@@ ves Mat@@ ter will have published a statement in response to the question of the Fox @-@ News @-@ personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love @-@ group , &quot; said the guides .
recently , Dam@@ on was invited upon a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le , who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss about the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .

&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja W@@ arri@@ or &apos;s First Champion
professional sport climb@@ s and operating assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first ath@@ l@@ ete which won the American Nin@@ ja W@@ arri@@ or on Monday evening and took the Grand Prix of 1 million $ .
the competition show which had just completed their 7th season had never experienced a contest , who could close all stages of its obstacle course .
during the season , there are two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , until the final .
the last task was the climbing at a 75 feet long climbing race in 30 seconds .
B@@ ritten ended the task inside the time , which he was the first ath@@ l@@ ete who completed the stren@@ uous phase 4 by American Nin@@ ja W@@ arri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! messages after the hard @-@ war victory , still under shock above the prize of the Great Award of 1 million $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it is amazing to think about it , I have never had anything more than 10,000 $ or a life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! over his he@@ ap money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as suddenly .. as I can not even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Rep@@ orter to discuss the final and why B@@ ritten , although he completed the course at all , not just the prize money .
after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , he will receive one with the quick@@ est time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
how much the money is a wonderful price and life is changing , it receives the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t believe he was holding some Gro@@ ll .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received the masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I should be be@@ aten by someone then I am glad there is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have just as felt , if they had listened to the roles .
America Nin@@ ja W@@ arri@@ or was extended for an A@@ id season , the fil@@ ming will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers Gr@@ inding to Min@@ nes@@ ota T@@ wins by
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OLI@@ S@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers stand on the final place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as Spo@@ iler , however , played this part in the Tuesday perfect against Min@@ nes@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target Field .
the T@@ wins accum@@ ulated a chance for Ascension in a game of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card Square .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all vic@@ tories have fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad S@@ mus .
Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon gave his early offensive support to sustain the Detroit three times in the first two inside , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ne@@ on .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) suggested 6 times on into 1 / 3 inside and allowed three r@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his final nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ and every game and therefore I want to go into the game quite concentr@@ ating .
the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ ered Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since the middle of August .
it was the first three hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z since then he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did well p@@ itted the stroke of wood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said El@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( stroke training ) , looked much better in the Bull@@ ring , and he carried it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the rear , at the end of the seventh cour@@ ings , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back to the game again .
centre Fiel@@ d@@ B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double in the left @-@ hand line .
Right Fiel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a p@@ unt and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier for Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran wall , the only man who was faced with whom he was faced , before the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ Schlag@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , who was created a two @-@ run s@@ by .
with a pair of run@@ ners and the finishing @-@ run at the second brought in by the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
in the major league for the 27 th time this season , Pl@@ ou@@ ffe suggested a double Play .
after Detroit added a Insurance Run at the end of ninth Congress , the wall made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and recorded the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed seals , however , S@@ ano with three pitches for his fifth place .
Detroit prof@@ ited for the pre@@ l@@ ude of the game from an unprecedented Phil Hu@@ ghes .
the tig@@ ers achieved three of us in the first two cour@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been mur@@ dered in front of the game from the inju@@ red list after having been missing for a back over a month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I desired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ ghes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt more confident when I was rele@@ asing and sens@@ ed that I would create some pretty good pitches in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after being in the first the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ters received , Hus@@ hes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z led Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to the game , who made a single &quot; up the Middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed its 0 @-@ 21 track series with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right hand , made another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second , achieved a one @-@ out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose on 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not go well , but he never got the right place .
Hu@@ ghes found himself in a pitch ch , sco@@ red no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the Rel@@ ax@@ ing Office A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ ghes , there came to three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ chez said because of a violation of the litter @-@ school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the Sh@@ ine of San@@ chez in 2007 .
San@@ chez , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder @-@ cut , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris will last from the vulner@@ abilities to start the wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30 July
he was missing since 20 August because of a crus@@ hing in the right hip .

the leader of the Mün@@ chner Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; I think that re@@ are@@ well thinking about military action options may not take place without Germany , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he thre@@ w the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago one was glad that the cup of military involvement in Germany has been passing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict is cr@@ ashing in front of our front door , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Germany have also sent not refugees to Austria for Germany too .
&quot; no , that is so agreed , &quot; she declared .
on the question of an agreement , which Germany could include a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said already in this context between the Director@@ ate @-@ General for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
concrete figures called it not and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
tens of thousands of refugees had passed over the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ ers from Hungary to Austria in recent days .
your goal is mostly Germany .
ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states have so far not been able to agree on common action in the crisis .
the EU &apos;s interior ministers want to take a new attempt at a special transfer to the binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
given the strong refugees in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in the first @-@ up and distribution of people .
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Minister at the emb@@ assy in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined , those people who fear , be@@ eke@@ eping this too .
who doesn &apos;t have a lead perspective that could not be in Germany too .
this view was impressive in the first round .
the ch@@ anc@@ ellor stressed that the state as a whole is now facing a &quot; huge power of force . &quot;
thousands of displ@@ aced refugees now stuck on the Bal@@ kan@@ route .
Hungary interrupted on its night on Tuesday its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wants to avoid that sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers sear@@ ched over Romania , &quot; named Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to to the planned new Gren@@ zz@@ aun .
the Romanian government condemned the plan immediately .
there were first ar@@ rests of people that had gone through the fence .

in the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who put his very personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of bi@@ blical story on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms have obtained the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : the respective subjects are adapted , which can quite seem quite ble@@ ak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; about three years said Ot@@ mar Alt in his Bible Project , for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many topics of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book of all books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originated are cycles , which devote issues like cross @-@ du@@ g , pl@@ agues , command@@ ments or pat@@ ernity .
in this way , he has spont@@ ane@@ ously fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ publishing house with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ publishing house with its emphasis on art text@@ books .
and there is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who dealt with on the basis of painting with the respective Bible sites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt selected be@@ aten and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; translated into current relationships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are as ver@@ bal mirror of ag@@ ts painting .
they are nestled between the original Bi@@ as@@ z@@ itat by Martin Luther and one sentence of the artist , who is here formulated his entirely personal thoughts on the particular situation .
the jewel has golden letters .
so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , its emotions .
it is a high level of intimacy .
emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wern@@ iger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter @-@ Or@@ den .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , the education already happened with the Rohr@@ stock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remember Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work that , in order to write me away from the Lord again , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to help the art back to more important times : &quot; the perception of picture wel@@ ten is now marked by Re@@ cl@@ ame , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is made there .
artists have a different desire and wh@@ onne to show things .
images always have some mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the spect@@ ator look at the pictures &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; let them discover and feel what power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for its object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he compreh@@ end his own pictures . &quot;
alt did not notice the Bible completely , but the Bible selected for him , also mysterious topics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no collaboration on eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the images , the text explains only . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( bi@@ blical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen images - is presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on 15 November at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further memorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works in the former indoor pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deutsche B intensified commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees to 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga continues a clear sign on the weekend .
the soccer respon@@ ds to the sp@@ itz@@ able situation in Germany and as@@ sures the policy of its help with tackling the upcoming problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this for the greatest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no man to say in principle that doesn &apos;t matter , I have nothing to do with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has to be interested every individual to get this topic under control , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B @-@ Chief Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday at the emb@@ assy office and meet the President of Mrs Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will certainly play a central role &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football could and would like to help .
but the decisive ordination has to place the politics .
the German soccer association has therefore expanded its refugee policy &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; about the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun @-@ Foundation , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; S@@ wor@@ s@@ bach , at the edge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some German li@@ gi@@ sts support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already this weekend , the 36 Profi@@ ver@@ eine ensures a clear sign when they are on the left tri@@ kot@@ är@@ mel instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logos ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We will help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said goodbye , Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and recorded the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ understand@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes every one , no one can see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we can use football ( no , we have to use our radi@@ otherapy , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly suffered , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
Hoff@@ enh@@ ei@@ ms Managing Director Peter ret@@ t spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot;
zum EM @-@ Quali@@ fications against Hungary on this Friday invites the national team of women 100 refugees to Halle / Saale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ id@@ s@@ bach outlines the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large common piece of German football &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 lic@@ en@@ ings have had their own projects in their places , be great .
just as great is that small and smallest acc@@ ents are active .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we spent , is spent in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
this year , the association will jointly contribute to the integration of refugees with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government with 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the associations have already been called for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported kidney s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP @-@ St@@ amps lose an eye
the leader of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost several reports , according to a fall in early July the left eye .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the accident at the stair@@ way in the house of his brother in the US he fell into a water k@@ aving to midnight , that he carried in the left hand , report the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economic week &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he is almost destroyed , was f@@ ain@@ ted , then left out to the road - that he tells us so last week , &quot; quot@@ ed the &quot; Wi@@ Wo@@ &quot; SAP @-@ Co @-@ founder of Has@@ so Plat@@ ner .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could take his work out .
&quot; at the beginning of October we met before the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Sass@@ ner .
the 54 year old manager was at the meeting and &quot; fully work @-@ fit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday tour ) , and will come back to Germany in October and will continue to conduct the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m fully happy for SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was all the time in regular contact with the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board and his chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; SZ . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the U.S. , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP Head@@ quarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he was important to go to the public with such a personal history , the manager of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SZ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said something to happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to get up again if you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

football : Bv@@ B without re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller im Tor
at Bor@@ ussia Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco re@@ us in the first group game of the Europe League will final .
the National players will also lack the leader of the Bundes@@ liga as well as in the Du@@ ell with the F@@ K Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 . / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot draw on him unfortunately , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Leverkusen , the BV@@ B @-@ coach was open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high burden of his professionals , Tu@@ chel will change his tribe eleven only on the re@@ us position .
so he announced a change on the door@@ ke@@ eper position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller continues the square of St@@ eper &apos;s Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; praised the football teacher the world champion .
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ ters is used in future in all European league games , Tu@@ chel had however been open .
with a high probability he will also ride the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the near evidence of te@@ amm@@ ers re@@ us that the final decision for the BV@@ B in the Europe League will be the goal to realize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for trac@@ e@@ worthy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Marco is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to access the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government aims at the cutting edge for Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany shall be fron@@ tr@@ un@@ ner after the will of the federal government in the transition of cars &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bundes@@ kab@@ in@@ ett decided on Wednesday a Strateg@@ i@@ ep@@ ap@@ ee of the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobr@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dobr@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse I@@ AA from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new home age &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
automated driving and net@@ worked driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less stress , said Dobr@@ ind@@ t .
he wants to discuss the topic with his ministers of the G@@ 7 countries which come together with representatives of the industry at the I@@ AA .
among other things , the Strateg@@ i@@ ep@@ ap@@ oration of the Ministry of Defence argu@@ ed among other things the importance of the mobile broad@@ band building and a high level of entry to digital radio station .
a testing of new technique is currently being created on the motorway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that the driver will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability claims &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where needed to adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use internationally internationally for the permitted maximum speed for self @-@ driving cars raised by 10 to 130 intervals .
the Federal Government also wants to apply to a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only seen the human being as a driver .
by autom@@ ating driving , the car takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is primarily based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in sec@@ th@@ less rapid .
after an annual study by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , it will be possible to provide highly automated driving vehicles to motor@@ ways by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , there are still driving vehicles on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added value in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the site of Germany appreciate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8,@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital connectivity of the P@@ KW@@ s can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD traffic @-@ Transport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the liability of liability in accidents and the security of the personal data of the drivers must be clear either .
but the German self @-@ driving cars see however sc@@ ep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey on Wednesday at the AA presented survey of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the exam@@ in@@ gan@@ isation dec@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that self @-@ driving cars will succeed in the next ten years , 32 percent are not reck@@ oned in 20 years now , 31 per cent believe in it at all .
in France 21 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed up to 20@@ 25 by toll @-@ driving cars , in the US 33 percent .
anyway , the drivers in Germany are not ready to rely entirely on a self @-@ driving vehicle .
according to a survey conducted by the Bit@@ kom , only seven percent will agree to complete control during the entire trip on all roads .
on the fre@@ eway that could be unusual in flowing transport after 15 percent , in the traffic 45 percent .
well every v@@ ated would leave the car to under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team@@ - and double start at Tis@@ cht@@ en@@ nis @-@ EM
the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer wants to settle for jet@@ ty stand between September 25 and October 4 only in the single .
the final decision will be handed down at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are strong enough , even without Timo to get the title &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said machine Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM @-@ apprentic@@ eship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ oll was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor for sponsor@@ ship in China .
the 34 year old German master is expected on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are now no longer as a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Europ@@ am@@ eister Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who runs the S@@ etz@@ ee in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , but also reminded of the EM 2013 in Sch@@ and@@ ro@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , Timo also was missing and we have become European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by doing so , we should base our list of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World tran@@ g@@ lists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels old for an end y ?
it is a mixture of very large Mo@@ den@@ schau and a Wach@@ s@@ fig@@ uren Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) announced an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : DIS@@ PLAY MANNEQUINS , which are similar to Video@@ proj@@ ections .
they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , which was among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as Büh@@ nen@@ out@@ fits to the great star of Mo@@ des@@ ks - and with it that he hid men in skirts .
&quot; I can no longer say today that I am the En@@ f@@ ant Henn@@ der Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier it was b@@ lown , meanwhile it is genuine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( V@@ om &apos;s side@@ walk on the cat@@ walk ) , which is seen from September 18 at the Kuns@@ thalle of the HY@@ PO @-@ Kulturstiftung , it is a bit of luck that the Mo@@ des@@ ch@@ ö@@ ver has changed its beginning to look at a show on his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was opposed , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sound a bit after death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , one gets into the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it is about so much more than just beautiful d@@ resses , &quot; the director of Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en .
it go to tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the man &apos;s barely ever @-@ looking work of the man , who has written history , without ever having an education .
chron@@ ologically is the show not constructed , but it is a great chore@@ ographic work that was done so much effort : to fr@@ ise the d@@ olls , for example being a sty@@ list engaged .
14 tons of material made the movers according to data of the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .

&quot; &quot; &quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ ti@@ ers alter Ted@@ dy is in the exhibition to see .
he stands for the first , tender mo@@ an object of design .
as a child ( he was not good student and evil in football ) he was attracted to his Ted@@ dy bass and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
playing with a pupp@@ et , his parents would not have allowed him .
he got the dis@@ appearance of fashion he later brought himself to itself .
he has steel and art @-@ magazines and looked at the dra@@ fts of other designers , such as Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought it but of course .
for his first own fashion show , he did not pay the Mod@@ els .
they got nothing but were allowed to keep the clothes ...
jewelry instead of be@@ ard@@ ine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze als fashion @-@ N@@ ische
previously it went to the long embro@@ ider@@ y machinery in and around Pl@@ auen to make meters .
the embro@@ i@@ dered fabrics and points emerged in large amount for customers , which they worked for example on blan@@ kets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work today , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the Mo@@ j@@ ad@@ j@@ okes .
instead the mode is important again .
in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze mode , fashion played a major role , was then pushed out by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : head in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and at regional tr@@ ams .
ever bil@@ de the so @-@ called vintage fashion , who re@@ jects talks on past styles , an increasing customer potential .
who@@ ever does not cat@@ ers in the textile industry in Germany is no longer in the market .
with us , they already have half of all orders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ j@@ og@@ gles Pl@@ auen is together with nine other companies in the branch of industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pl@@ au@@ ener &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and embro@@ ider@@ ies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last 15 years some 80 percent of sales were cut off . &quot; &quot; &quot;
private dealers and also the wholes@@ ale are almost no more .
our products can hardly be reached on this way .
the mass goods are produced in the Asian region a lot cheaper and almost exclusively distributed over chains .
moreover , the export of export , to Russia and the USA .
so enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also attempts through environmental awareness , as Cord@@ ula Bauer ac@@ ul@@ ted by the nit@@ rogen in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since this year we are leading a seal of quality that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this refers to the materials used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , diplom@@ a designer Ute Schmidt is re@@ vered at the Schne@@ eberger out@@ ward of the West@@ s@@ äch@@ s@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty for Applied Art - and is specialized in embro@@ ider@@ ies and tops .
in order to cont@@ end the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies , which have to think mainly economically , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , an existing design often become easily varied , in order to keep a customer base .
a few years ago , textile design manager Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter the historical snow @-@ top new .
here the machine sends some places small pots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ schm@@ ie@@ de@@ gem in Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ sauce led to it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously I could do nothing with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow @-@ tip for their jewelry .
in a consuming method they shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the theme of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter .
she also delivers to the US , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors were living in Pl@@ auen and surroundings and would like a souvenir .
with this I see my jewelry as a modern amb@@ assador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener tip .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is not about a new film , but a kind of continuation , which plays a film about 20 years after the first film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about the experience of the N@@ anny and the family Banks in times of the World Economic Cris@@ is in England .

EU agre@@ es to double mer@@ cury in prey
the European Commission aims to double the bor@@ der@@ ms for mer@@ cury in large car@@ ni@@ ers and consumers with it a significantly higher dose of nerve .
the consumer organization Food@@ watch , which is an attractive work@@ book of the EU , critic@@ ized the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of fail@@ ing and environmental policy will be forwar@@ ded with full power to pregnant and inf@@ ants , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch .
Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the bor@@ der@@ ers of nerve po@@ ison@@ ous should be lifted to large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from the &quot; economic grounds &quot; of one to two milli@@ grams of Mercury , each kil@@ ogra@@ m of fish .
large car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res are already so heavily stra@@ ined with mer@@ cury , that on the basis of the current limit values , about 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches are not sold .
after dou@@ bling of the thres@@ hold , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be irre@@ voc@@ al .
in return for this attrac@@ t@@ ment , the EU according to Food@@ watch wants to tigh@@ ten the limits on other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ gram to 0.1 milli@@ grams of Mercury per kil@@ ogra@@ m .
Food@@ watch described this as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller cemet@@ eries , such as car@@ p are usually so low charged , that they already keep the planned top @-@ values already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ab@@ lement at Kl@@ einf@@ isch was therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ des &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; distr@@ action &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which helps alone the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mercury is one of the human po@@ ison@@ ed heavy metals that den@@ sely populated across the food chain , especially in de@@ ple@@ xed fish .
the Federal Government is therefore warned that &quot; already small amounts are particularly to cause during Un@@ n@@ atives of the nervous system . &quot;
the Federal Environment Ministry declared on its website with regard to the current maximum @-@ values , however , that a &quot; health concern for the general population &quot; is not expected to be expected .
Mercury is carried out primarily by the coal @-@ burning in the environment .
according to the German coal @-@ power plants , according to a written survey of the Federal Environment Ministry , Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bock more than six tons of Mercury in the year consists of , two thirds of the total in Germany over the total .
the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish approximately in El@@ be , river and Danube is &quot; permanent and surface @-@ covered , &quot; had quot@@ ed the &quot; Spiegel &quot; in March of the paper .
last year we met Europe @-@ wide war@@ nings before mer@@ cury in fish already among the most common health risks in the EU @-@ War@@ n@@ system RA@@ S@@ FF .
