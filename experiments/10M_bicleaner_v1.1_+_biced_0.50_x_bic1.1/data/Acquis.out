a reag@@ ent to blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples which contain the tigen that is hom@@ olo@@ g or another on the label .
if a reag@@ ent is used by the manufacturer in the manufacturer , the following factors or appearances are not present : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic characteristics ;
the Tit@@ es will be measured up to double in a suitable medium by getting the re@@ proof of the re@@ acting Re@@ ag@@ enz@@ es .
the title is the re@@ zi@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum , in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated exclusively of the volume of blood cells in the total volume .
in anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other reag@@ ents that are supposed to be used on property developers , the activity is required by the time that is necessary for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B , as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D reag@@ ent for blood group determination , is specified , and for reag@@ ents of other speci@@ f@@ ity are performed at the time of the standards .
according to the definition , a international standard prepar@@ atory contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is regardless of the titles that are monitored by individual preparations for red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of reag@@ ents to the blood group determination is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ary , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions during an ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te stream .
the title gives the di@@ lution of the re@@ ag@@ ence in the last mixture within a series where a micro@@ scop@@ ic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of reag@@ ent for blood group determination are present ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B and in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the title of unknown reag@@ ent in international units ( See Bulletin WHO OMS , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you return it to a volume of 1 ml , the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B use according to the 256 International units per ml .
the preparations are available for free from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards in the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens serum Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a compar@@ ative Tit@@ ration of the International standard anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; Anti @-@ A @-@ Re@@ ag@@ enz@@ es ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; P@@ IC F@@ IL@@ E = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 450@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a reag@@ ent is stored under the manufacturer &apos;s recommended conditions , its required properties should remain at least one year long .
the expi@@ ration date of a reproduction in the form of a label is not a year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the expi@@ ration date on the label exp@@ iry date for dry reag@@ ents depends on the results of the expi@@ ration tests ; it is appro@@ ving by the state control authorities .
dried re@@ agen@@ das are kept in a atmosphere of iner@@ ated gas or vacuum in a vacuum , and in the glass container where they are dried and which is so closed that no humidity can penet@@ rate .
a dr@@ ink@@ able re@@ acting may not lose any weight than 0.5 v.@@ H. when it is produced by more drying over phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxy@@ d in a pressure of no more than 0,@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
to avoid bacterial growth , the state @-@ state authority may determine that the reag@@ ent ( or the solv@@ ent supplied solv@@ ents ) , an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , will continue to determine the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2,5 m@@ g. of protein @-@ nitrogen per ml flu@@ x or re @-@ dissolved ser@@ ums .

according to the international exchange of certain reag@@ ents for blood groups , they should not be arti@@ f@@ ici@@ ally colored , at least as long as the International Convention on a unified system has come .
reag@@ ent for blood group determination are distributed in such a way and in such quantities that this is not only sufficient to carry tests with the unknown blood cells , but also for carrying tests with positive and negative controversy .
the amount required in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer @-@ laboratory has over all output levels and controls to the reag@@ ent content of written records .
appropriate samples of all reag@@ ents are so long from the laboratory , until with some lik@@ el@@ ihood may be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
the reag@@ ents used for blood group determination can contain substances human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of them represent the effective proportion , the others are the necessary aid to ampli@@ fication the effectiveness and recovery of the stability of the reag@@ ents .
for technical reasons this reag@@ ent are divided into three groups following the origin of their effective work .
this does not mean that the reag@@ ent human origin contains exclusively between human origin or that animal or herbal reag@@ ents can contain any substances of human origin .
each single container is a black @-@ printed label in English and French , which contains the following details : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the quantity or , when dried reag@@ ents , the quantity and composition of the necessary liquid ,
furthermore , this label or label on the cardboard box , in which the individual containers may contain the following details : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,

it ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ous human red blood cells that contain the A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) an@@ tigen ( which are not ag@@ glut@@ ined in general by anti @-@ A serum of blood don@@ ors of group B ) .
an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard pre@@ par@@ ate of the anti @-@ A blood group @-@ groups or a corresponding compar@@ ative equivalent of A1 and A2 blood cells .
furthermore , it is parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard prepar@@ atory of the anti @-@ B blood group disease or a corresponding equivalent of B @-@ blood cells .
the effectiveness of the serum must not be less than 64 international units per ml .
an un@@ dil@@ uted anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum must also cause a easily recogni@@ zable ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the Group A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) .
an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed with equal amounts of between A1 and A2 blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double times , which is necessary , if the same attempts with the anti @-@ A blood group @-@ groups or with a standard prepar@@ atory activity is carried out .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed to an object carrier with the same amount of 5@@ - to 10 percent of floo@@ ding within the double times , which is necessary , if the same attempt will be dissolved with the again dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard prepar@@ atory of the anti @-@ B blood groups or a standard pre @-@ saving of the same Avi@@ dity .
an anti @-@ B + an anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed with the same amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent up@@ stream of A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 Â ° C .
anti @-@ R@@ h blood group sera each specific@@ ity can be one of two types , which distinguish themselves through the pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ites , among which a ag@@ glut@@ ination hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells is achieved .
with others that are referred to as &quot; in@@ complete , &quot; a ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved in presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids , such as beef alb@@ um@@ in or with other special methods .
some &quot; in@@ complete &quot; Sera ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ers on object dreams also hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells that are sli@@ pped in their own serum or plasma .
the following requirements for the effectiveness of Sera to determine the R@@ h group may be possible if International standard prepar@@ es are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is obtained from the blood of one or more persons who are immune to the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
