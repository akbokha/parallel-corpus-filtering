the present document is a summary of the European Public Service Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which explains how the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the conducted studies to make recommendations concerning the application of the medicine .
if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package details ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ists .
if you wish for further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and an injection solution ( 7,5 mg / ml ) .
B. Cast thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or vision of things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and mad@@ ness ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental illness , in which the patients man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal flood ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood .
abili@@ fy is used for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic episodes , and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
injection solution is applied to rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ oral disorders , if the oral medicine is not possible .
in both cases , the solution can be used for inhal@@ ing or melting tablets in patients , which prepar@@ es the swal@@ low of tablets .
patients who are taking other medicines simultaneously , which are identified as Abi@@ li@@ fy , should be adapted to the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy .
this imp@@ airs the signal transfer between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances which allow the communication of nerve cells each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene probably works as a &quot; partial ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also called ser@@ otonin ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but in less than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
since d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine have played a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psychological or man@@ ic symptoms and prevent their re@@ unification .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy , preventing the recovery of symptoms , was studied in three studies by up to one year .
the efficacy of injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar illness , who had previously suffered a placebo over a period of two hours .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was tested for twelve weeks at 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo which had been stabil@@ ised to 160 patients with which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabil@@ ised with abili@@ fy .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder which suffered from Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients was examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients receiving treatment .
the company also introduced studies to investigate how the body uses the melting tablets and solution for inser@@ tion ( up ) .
in both studies , patients who received doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness than the patients who received a placebo .
in the use of the bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than placebo .
in addition to 74 weeks , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented the repeated man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if there was additionally treated to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy @-@ injec@@ tions in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo and were similar to as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy for intake ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , headache , bl@@ ur@@ red vision , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( sin@@ cer@@ ation ) , sp@@ inal hyper@@ secre@@ tion ( increased memory production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ ers ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Abi@@ li@@ fy in treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to serious episodes in patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes , and of which the man@@ ic episodes were opposed to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in addition , the committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution for rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ oral problems in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes at Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when an oral therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the placing of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is shown for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ian episode in patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes , and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , regardless of meals .
an increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as a mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and Bi@@ polar disorder in patients at least 65 years has not been proved .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of these patient groups should be considered a lower initi@@ ation dose when clinical factors are justi@@ fying this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P3@@ A4 In@@ duc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurr@@ ence of su@@ ici@@ dal behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene ( see section 4.8 ) .
results from a epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that patients with bi@@ polar disorder has no increased view@@ point risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene should be applied to patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cereb@@ ral heart failure , hypo@@ vol@@ an@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure @-@ absor@@ bing drugs ) or hypertension ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene .
in case of an AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y patients treated signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , should be taken into consideration , reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without any additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , must be removed .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ole should be applied in patients with sei@@ zu@@ res in the An@@ am@@ nese or states who are related with sei@@ zu@@ res in the context of caution .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene in patients who are associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ans were an elevated death rate compared to placebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fi@@ xer dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to un@@ wanted cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole patients .
hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients that were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk ass@@ essments for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ related un@@ wanted events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ th@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ia due to com@@ edi@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain as side effect is observed , and may result in serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is provided when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene in combination with alcohol or other central @-@ effective medicines are taken with over@@ bearing side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 @-@ ant@@ agon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased by 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects , and that is why other dose @-@ reductions must be made .
in CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ isation , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma cent@@ er@@ ings compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ u@@ sive metabolism .
if you consider the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the potential benefit should exceed the potential risks for patients .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , have similar effects , and that is why other dose @-@ reductions must be made .
after replacing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dos@@ ing of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the dos@@ ing height before the beginning of the esc@@ ort therapy .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ u@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered jointly with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be calculated with a moderate increase in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 m@@ g. Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ y@@ or@@ an / 3 @-@ methodology ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ y@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify her medical doctor if she &apos;s pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to inadequate data conditions on humans and due to the concerns incur@@ red in the reproductive studies in the animal , this drug may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit is clearly the potential risk of fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics the patients should be warned against getting dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ ans have no negative influence on them .
the following adverse events occurred more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects were defined by the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total of lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ e@@ ie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ nic , compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of more than 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was below Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients below placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients suffering from O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic episodes at Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with semi @-@ op@@ i@@ dol treatment .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was administered in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences .
enh@@ ances of the CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ans treated patients compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
to the side effects associated with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ ants and sei@@ zu@@ res , un@@ wanted cereb@@ ral events and increased mortality of elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes mell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , an un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional ab@@ duction with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg , and without death sequence .
although no information on the effectiveness of a hem@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis in treating Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , however , it is unlikely that hem@@ i@@ aly@@ sis is in the treatment of a transfer of benefits as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene has a high plasma connection .
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I dis@@ ruption is communic@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in vitro a high aff@@ inity to the d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 receptor and a moderate aff@@ inity to d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4- , ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gen and to the Hist@@ amin @-@ H1@@ receptor .
at the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily about 2 weeks of healthy volunteers the Pos@@ it@@ eboard @-@ E@@ missions @-@ Tom@@ ography showed a dos@@ is@@ dependent reduction of the bonds of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ d@@ us and at the put@@ point .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ ans showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychological symptoms .
in one week 52 the proportion of patients who received a response to study medication was similar in one week , in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zol 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values of measuring signals defined as secondary stages , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery Az@@ berg@@ - depres@@ sions @-@ scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of more than 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate , which stood at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled controlled dual blind study with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients involved in significantly fewer patients receiving a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) .
in two placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy @-@ studies with more flexible dosage for 3 weeks with a man@@ ian or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene showed a placebo over 3 weeks compared to placebo .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study about 3 weeks with fi@@ xer or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ian or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene showed a placebo @-@ based efficacy comparable to placebo in week 3 , which was comparable to lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol released 12 a comparable share of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ie on how Lithium or Hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of more than 6 weeks with a man@@ ian or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without mental ser@@ otherapy , which are partly over 2 weeks not on lithium or Val@@ pro@@ ate @-@ mon@@ otherapy in a superior effectiveness with the reduction of chronic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy , with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had reached a re@@ mission during a stabil@@ ising period of Rand@@ om@@ ani@@ zation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole demonstrated to placebo over the prevention of a bi@@ polar response , predominantly in the prevention of a feedback in the Man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes CY@@ P@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for dehy@@ d@@ ration and hydro@@ xy@@ ulation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by CY@@ P3@@ A4 .
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation calendar time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zene in the exten@@ u@@ sive metabolism of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and at least 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ izing over CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zene there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a Pop@@ ulations @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic characteristics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study of subjects with various grave of liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect concerning the imp@@ air@@ ment of liver function on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw shots on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeat@@ ability , reproductive ox@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and the cervical potential , pre @-@ clinical data provided no particular dangers for humans .
tox@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which exceeded the maximum dose or exposure of the human being , so they only have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects associated a dos@@ is@@ dependent tribut@@ ary accumulation ( AU@@ C ) in rats at 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to the recommended maximum dose for people ) and an increase of anne@@ x carcin@@ oma ( AU@@ C ) with female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times the middle ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for people ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate @-@ con@@ ju@@ ades of hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( which is 1- to 3@@ fold of the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations in the human species at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ ole were not found more than 6 % of concentrations that were found in the study of 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of Mon@@ keys , and lie well below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro sol@@ ub@@ ility .
in rabbits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which resulted in ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ fold the medium @-@ sized Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

man@@ ic episodes at Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study about 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I dis@@ ruption is communic@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled controlled dual blind study with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients involved in significantly fewer patients receiving a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) .
97 in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dosage with a man@@ ian or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior effectiveness .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , which was compared to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form in healthy volunteers , the ratio between the geomet@@ ric C@@ max value is the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Fur@@ thermore , a chol@@ eli@@ ac disease was found as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate @-@ con@@ ju@@ ades of hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene in the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 ) .
in rabbits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which resulted in ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ fold the medium @-@ sized Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is applied to rapid control of integrity and behavior in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when an oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol injection solution should be completed and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene .
to minim@@ ize the res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ize the vari@@ ability , an injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep in the glut@@ eus @-@ maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under changing of adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may depend on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicine already used for the maintenance or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
in case the continuing oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene is indicated , see the summary of the features of the pharmaceutical using AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y hot tablets or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution for inser@@ tion .
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with integrity and behavi@@ oral disorders caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
in case a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with Ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ inen in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ ac@@ z@@ ole injection solution is considered necessary , the patients should be observed in extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) .
tests on safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zene injection solution are not present for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( by sc@@ anned or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene should be applied to patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cereb@@ ral heart failure , hypo@@ vol@@ an@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure @-@ absor@@ bing drugs ) or hypertension ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle strength , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse , blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ net , swe@@ ating and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ) .
poly@@ th@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ia due to com@@ edi@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain as side effect is observed , and may lead to severe complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was greater compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study in the healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) , and which was administered at the same time Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular .
105 The H2 @-@ ant@@ agon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a gast@@ ric acid block@@ ers , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .
compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma cent@@ rations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and H@@ IV@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , have similar effects , and that is why other dose @-@ reductions must be made .
after replacing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dos@@ ing of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the dos@@ ing height before the beginning of the esc@@ ort therapy .
106 lau@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly administered was the intensity of the se@@ d@@ ding greater compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zene injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of the side effects were defined by the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 . the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant adverse events in clinical trials ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled study conducted over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients below Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients below placebo .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS acu@@ ity was 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences .
enh@@ ances of the CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole patients compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .

110 and behavi@@ oral problems was the Ari@@ pi@@ ac@@ z@@ ole injection solution with statistically significant greater improvements in ag@@ ility / behavior compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder and behavi@@ oral problems and behavi@@ oral defic@@ its associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms of integrity and behavi@@ oral problems in comparison to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
observed average improvement from the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS excitement Compon@@ ent score in the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe conduc@@ ti@@ ghtness , a similar efficacy was observed in terms of total population , but statistical significance could be determined due to a reduced patient level .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene ( oral ) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychological symptoms .
in one week 52 the proportion of patients received in one Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol study was similar to a response to study medication , in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zol 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values of measuring signals defined as secondary stages , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depres@@ sions @-@ scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study conducted more than 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction of recur@@ rence , which stood at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multinational dual blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients involved in significantly fewer patients receiving a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of about 5.6 kg .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with a man@@ ian or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without mental effects , which are partly over 2 weeks not on lithium or Val@@ pro@@ ate @-@ mon@@ otherapy in a superior effectiveness with the reduction of chronic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy , with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension of man@@ ic patients who had reached a re@@ mission during a stabil@@ ising period of Rand@@ om@@ ani@@ zation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole demonstrated to placebo over the prevention of a bi@@ polar response , predominantly in the prevention of a return in the Man@@ ia .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol AU@@ C is 90 % higher in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , 90 % greater the AU@@ C according to the same dose as a tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two mus@@ sels .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers the average time until reaching the maximum plasma intensity at 1 @-@ 3 hours .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene injection solution was toler@@ ated well by rats and monkeys , resulting in any direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after a systematic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly exposure to a systemic exposure of 30 mg .
in studies on reproductive reactions after intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ relevant concerns after maternal exposure , which ranged in 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rabbits ) on the maximum human exposure of 30 mg .
based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeat@@ ability , reproductive ox@@ icity , and the cervical potential , pre @-@ clinical data provided no particular dangers for humans .
tox@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which exceeded the maximum dose or exposure during humans ; so they only have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects associated a dos@@ is@@ dependent tribut@@ ary accumulation ( AU@@ C ) in rats at 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to the recommended maximum dose for people ) and an increase of anne@@ x carcin@@ oma ( AU@@ C ) with female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times the medium @-@ level @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for people ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate @-@ con@@ ju@@ ades of hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( which is 1 to 3 times the average level of @-@ state exposure or 16@@ - to 81 times the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 ) .
these effects following doses have been observed for dos@@ ages , which resulted in ex@@ positions of 3- and 11 @-@ fold the mean state @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which three quarters had previously obtained an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medication ( given in combination with other drugs to reduce side effects ) .
in total , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 patients with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients to the treatment of 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el stored medicines .
in terms of patients who were treated for the first time due to metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference regarding efficacy and survival compared to efficacy and survival .
in contrast , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el stored medicines earlier .
it may also be used in patients that have breast@@ feeding , or before the onset of treatment , low neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ s in the blood .
the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ ers ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane has been employed in patients where the first treatment was no longer suggests , more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained drugs , and that unlike other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ contained drugs have to be given in other drugs to decrease side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission approved The Abra@@ xis Bios@@ ci@@ ence Limited , a permit for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients where the first @-@ line therapy for metastatic disease is missing and which is not shown for a default anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ enia ( neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ation number &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or heavy sens@@ ory Neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
in sens@@ ory Neu@@ rop@@ athy 3 , treatment is to inter@@ rupt until a improvement of degree 1 or 2 will be reduced , and the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose @-@ adap@@ tations in patients with mild to moderate imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies involving patients suffering from kidney function and there is currently no sufficient data on the recommendation of dose @-@ adjust@@ ments in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to non @-@ sufficient data for uncertainty and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ related nan@@ op@@ ar@@ tic form@@ ul@@ ating from Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el which could have significantly other pharmac@@ ological features than other forms of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should immediately put away and have a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment , and the patient should not again be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patients no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated , up to the neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ s rose again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ tion has increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clear incidence of Abra@@ x@@ ane was not demonstrated in the context of cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , cardiac inci@@ dents in the indigenous patients inde@@ xes are un@@ common , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or under@@ lying heart or lung disease .
in case of the patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vomiting and diarrhea , these can be treated with the usual anti @-@ anti@@ em@@ atic and con@@ sti@@ tial powers .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not prac@@ tise during pregnancy or with women in a concentrated age that does not prac@@ tise an effective conception , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is un@@ changeable .
women in a concentrated age should be applied during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane to apply a reliable reference method .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is recommended , while and up to six months after the treatment no child is given .
male patients should be advised before treatment via a sperm count , since the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of an ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and dizziness ( frequently ) that can affect the traffic light and the ability to serve machines .
the following are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side @-@ effects listed in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ enia was the most striking ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( 79 % of patients reported ) and was quickly reversible and dos@@ is@@ depend@@ ant ; Leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of the patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .

the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two single @-@ blind patients and 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ized Phase III compar@@ ative study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ enter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received an allergic reaction with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el at 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medi@@ ation of allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without con@@ medi@@ ation ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a normal general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously received chemotherapy alone , 27 % had only a adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy alone , 40 % only for metast@@ ast@@ asi@@ fication and 19 % for met@@ ast@@ asi@@ fication and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .

the natural course of periph@@ eral neurop@@ athy to the sound on bas@@ eline due to cum@@ eline from Abra@@ x@@ ane to &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was identified in clinical trials .
the active ex@@ position ( AU@@ C ) increased linear range of 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After a intraven@@ ous gift from Abra@@ x@@ ane to patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plas@@ mak@@ is increased in multi@@ phase mode .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has a comprehensive ex@@ trav@@ as@@ cular distribution and / or soft binding by pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ min in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 .
after a solv@@ ent pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher than after a solv@@ ent pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the volume of delivery was Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue coating reports that Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily comprised to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ xy@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer was the average total dose of less than 1 % of the combined total dose of less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ xy@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a comprehensive non @-@ ren@@ al Clear@@ ance .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and also contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; reference plate &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood cells , in which the connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur if before the procedure is not possible , and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
treatment with se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician , which has experience in the treatment of patients with disorders that is shown for the medicine .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood don@@ ors , se@@ wing is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
injection can also be carried out by the patient or his coach who provided an appropriate instructions .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al failure , or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ ite in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl of children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to control in order to ensure that no iron deficiency consists of , and iron supplements should be given during the whole treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ emia may cause an an@@ a@@ emia caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ deficiency or so that the body does not suff@@ ice enough to the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby minim@@ ize the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to an injection in a v@@ ein in the context of a main study with 4@@ 79 patients who had caused an@@ a@@ emia to compare with the reference case .
all patients participating in this study was inj@@ ected for at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o into a v@@ ein before they were either converted to se@@ amed or continue E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
main indicators for efficacy was the change in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the onset of the study and the study period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
furthermore , the company presented the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin was spec@@ ulated ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o with 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study with patients who had suffered from kidney problems caused an@@ emia , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who have been converted to se@@ amed are calculated in the same degree as in those patients who continue to E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in contrast , the patients continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / d@@ l. of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure , which may occasionally lead to symptoms of a cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , side det@@ ain@@ able headache , and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed must not be applied in patients who may be inv@@ alid ( allergic ) against ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , since further studies are required to ensure that there are no allergic reactions .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the drug was provided according to the regulations of the European Union of proof that the medicine has a comparable quality , security and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that surro@@ unds Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information on medical specialists in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG to acquire a permit for placing of se@@ ag@@ ens in the entire European Union .
treatment of an@@ emia and reduction in adults with solid tum@@ ours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma who received chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre@@ existing an@@ emia during the onset of chemotherapy ) exists .
treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8.1 m@@ mol / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) if bleeding measures are not available or in@@ sufficient to demand a large blood supply unit ( 4 or more units blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
for the reduction of foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied to an adult orthop@@ a@@ edic intervention in adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fu@@ sions can be expected .

the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , except for p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients where the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration were between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mol / l ) .
ass@@ essments and symptoms can vary depending on age , gender , and total disease of disease ; therefore the evaluation of individual clinical trials and disease management is required by the doctor .
a rise in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ins to be avoided by more than 2 g / dl ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
because of the vari@@ ability between patients can occasionally be observed in one patient for individual ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values or among the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in targets .
in view of these hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried using the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in @-@ target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is incl@@ ined by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that Epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is in the lowest approved dose which is required for control of an@@ a@@ emia and accumulation of symptoms .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / d@@ l. or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mol / l ) may need higher yield doses than patients where initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mol / l ) .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.8 g / d@@ l. or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) may need higher yield doses than patients where initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) .
starting dose 50 / kg three times a week by intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose @-@ auction of 25 kg / kg ( three times a week ) , until the desired target is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
an@@ aes@@ thes@@ ia symptoms and - follow @-@ up may vary depending on age , gender , and total disease of disease ; therefore the evaluation of individual clinical trials and disease presence is needed .
in view of these hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried using the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in @-@ target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that Epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is in the lowest approved dose which is required for control of attachment symptoms .
if after 4 treatment weeks the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ ten@@ tion increased at least 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be maintained three times per week or 450 kg / kg once a week .

patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , with which the pre @-@ binding capacity of ≥ 4 blood conserv@@ atives is required , the se@@ wing should be obtained in a dose of 600 mg / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before the operative procedure .
the iron sub@@ stitution should be as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation programme - started in order to provide large iron reserves before the start of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy .
6 . the recommended dosage is 600 mg / kg ep@@ ox@@ et@@ tin al@@ fa which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the operational procedure and the day of the intervention ( day 0 ) .
in this case ep@@ ox@@ et@@ tin al@@ fa was supposed to be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 i.e. / kg each 10 consecutive days before , on the day of the intervention , and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , injection can be given at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis over the hose of a fi@@ st@@ na@@ del , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic cooking solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the cycle .
patients receiving treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in an ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive a se@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ia ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment , inst@@ ant@@ ile ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk for deep ven@@ i@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically @-@ known ven@@ ous Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) .
in patients who are intended to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous orthop@@ edic intervention , the application of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa can be affected by the following preventive disease , vas@@ cular arter@@ ial disease , vas@@ cular disease of the cardi@@ ology or cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease ; in patients with a recently @-@ accurate heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ ine event .
ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare has been reported on the occurr@@ ence of an em@@ bo@@ diment medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of years with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden effect , the reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) , with increased demand of tran@@ fu@@ sions , should be determined and the usual causes for a non @-@ speaking ( iron , fol@@ eic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminum toxic@@ ity , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) .
if the re@@ ticul@@ tur@@ tle value , taking into consideration the an@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes &quot; Index &quot; ) , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies are determined and an investigation of the bone mar@@ ch@@ marks should be obtained to diagnose an PR@@ CA diagnosis .
data for immun@@ o@@ gene@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of se@@ ag@@ ens in patients with a risk of anti @-@ induced induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al failure , the analysis of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in @-@ target concentration should not be exceeded in paragraph 4.2 .
in clinical trials an elevated mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed , when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ese stimul@@ ating agents ( ESA ) were given to a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit that is attributable to the gift of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration will be increased to the control of ass@@ ump@@ tions symptoms and avo@@ idance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month to minim@@ ize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al failure and clinical evidence cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease and in@@ suffici@@ ency should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in @-@ target concentration in paragraph 4.2 .
according to the present recognition , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency is not accelerated .
in tumour patients receiving antibiotic @-@ efficiency of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ tin al@@ fa should be considered a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa and the ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response ( patients who may need trans@@ lu@@ ded ) .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mol / l ) , the dose must be adjusted to section 4.2 , to minim@@ ize the risk of possible thro@@ mb@@ otic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemical @-@ related an@@ emia - Dos@@ age adjustment between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit risk reduction in the involvement of the particular patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic intervention , if possible , before the start of the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ emia are examined and treated accordingly .
patients that are under@@ going to under@@ go any more elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic intervention , as they have received an elevated risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cular diseases , especially for basic cardiovascular disease .
moreover , it cannot be excluded that in treatment with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa for patients with an initial ass@@ ay value of &gt; 13 g / dl , an increased risk of postoperative thro@@ mb@@ otic / vas@@ cular events can exist .
in several controlled trials , ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine did not prove that they improve overall survival in tumour patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , when a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in @-@ target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.7 m@@ mol / l ) was targeted
ep@@ ox@@ et@@ tin al@@ fa is used along with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood mirror of C@@ ic@@ los@@ in controls and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ indo@@ sis are adapted to increasing hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit .
there are no evidence of an interaction between ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding ugly differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .
over thro@@ mb@@ otic , vas@@ cular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ ale I@@ fo@@ s , cereb@@ ral isch@@ emia , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ s , pul@@ mon@@ ys@@ m , ret@@ ar@@ thro@@ mb@@ less and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidney was reported in patients with ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , so also in patients with Epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa is a dos@@ is@@ dependent increase of blood pressure or deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ ton@@ ia .
increased incidence of rom@@ bo@@ vas@@ cular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients suffering from ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine treatment .
regardless of the ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease can occur following repeated blood don@@ ate to thro@@ mb@@ ot@@ otic and vas@@ cular complications .
the genetically modified ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa is gly@@ cer@@ si@@ ulated and in terms of amino acids and carbohydrates , with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of endemic patients .
it could be demonstrated with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ tial cells that Epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ese and does not affect Leu@@ kop@@ o@@ ese .

survival and tumor cells were examined in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials and
in the open study , there was no difference in the overall survival between the patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin patients and the patient patient patients .
in these studies , patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients with an@@ emia based on various frequent mal@@ ign@@ ome consistent , statistically significantly higher mortality rates than in controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ less and related complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin patients and with inspec@@ tions satisfactory .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ic events in tumour patients who are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative impact on the overall survival can not be excluded .
it is not clari@@ fied how far this results are treated to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim to transfer a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in under 13 g / dl as a few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa determin@@ ations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ time period of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly longer half @-@ day period of about 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of Epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels which are reached after intraven@@ ous injection .
there are no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain unchanged , regardless of whether they will be determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ opause and men .
it is applied in patients with a high risk of frac@@ ture risk ( bone quar@@ ries ) , including patients who suffered a slightly trau@@ matic hip @-@ breaking like during patients ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal background of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should be obtained from the first in@@ fusion a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or by injec@@ tions in a muscle .
the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce the symptoms of symptoms such as fever , muscle aches , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
for the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the substance in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in zom@@ eta , a part of the data material used for zom@@ eta to assess A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in the first trial , nearly 8 000 older women with o@@ steopor@@ osis were involved , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures were examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with o@@ steopor@@ osis over 50 years that had suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; it was investigated by the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
main indicators for efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that builds bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women the risk of verteb@@ rates in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other o@@ steopor@@ osis ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to placebo .
compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other o@@ steopor@@ osis ) , the risk of frac@@ tures increased by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients with placebo ( 139 from 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after the in@@ fusion and are frequent in@@ fu@@ sions less frequently .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be applied to patients who may be inv@@ alid ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ics or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any of the other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ ates , patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduces the risk of kidney problems , reactions on the in@@ fusion and o@@ ste@@ on@@ o@@ arthritis ( extinction of bone tissue ) in the pine .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance material for doctors who use A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis as well as the drugs which is explained , as well as the same material for patients who are addressed to the effects of the medicine when they should turn to the physician .

for treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis and o@@ steopor@@ osis in men a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the operative supply of the envelope . ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a long race period was observed in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
additionally , it is highly advis@@ able to ensure patient with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get adequate intake of calcium , equivalent to at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced by the gift of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
patients with kidney function ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended as limited clinical experiences for these patient groups .
elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A flu@@ x adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of elimination with older patients are similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , because data are missing to in@@ comprehen@@ sibility and effectiveness .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , as for these patient population only limited clinical experiences .
a pre@@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is before the onset of therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid integration of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , partly symp@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia develop , whose maximum typically occurs within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) .
additionally , it is highly advis@@ able to ensure that in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get adequate intake of calcium , according to a minimum of 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , ensure at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .

for patients who require dental access , no data are available , whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the ja@@ w zone .
clinical evaluation by the treatment doctor should be the basis for treatment of any patient and based on an individual benefit risk evaluation .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced by the gift of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( see section 4.2 ) .
the prevalence of adverse events reported in patients who received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in patients who received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 51 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the o@@ steopor@@ osis studies ( PFT , Horizon - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Frac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was comparable to the overall incidence of pre@@ judi@@ ci@@ ary between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) un@@ wanted drug effects are listed in table 1 .
kidney function Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid was associated with kidney dys@@ functions , which resulted in a decrease of kidney function ( i.e. an increase of the serum creation ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ( a year before administration ) and the occurr@@ ence of kidney failure , and a restricted kidney function were comparable in o@@ steopor@@ osis over three years compared to the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in the serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after the gift was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients compared to placebo @-@ treated patients .
based on the assessment of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ atic amount of calcium @-@ values ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mol / l ) were observed in 2.3 % of patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical study treated patients compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the morph@@ ine Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received supple@@ ment@@ ing sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis , in the study to avoiding clinical frac@@ tures according to a frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get @-@ studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avo@@ idance of clinical frac@@ tures according to a recent qu@@ ul@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , however the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , ( 0.7 % ) .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the or@@ tho@@ sis was acci@@ dental , above all in cancer patients , above o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the ja@@ w ) reported with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including o@@ ste@@ omyel@@ itis , and the majority of reports rel@@ ates to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental patients .
7 study with 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients entered the or@@ tho@@ sis in the or@@ tho@@ sis region at an A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and placebo @-@ treated patients .
in case of an over@@ bur@@ s@@ ation which leads to a clinical @-@ relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , it can be achieved by the gift of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glucose .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was observed in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ Score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as ≤ -@@ 1.5 and at least two easy or medium @-@ severe Hurricane Sandy Bridge or a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without any signs of an existing spine .
effects on morph@@ ometric verteb@@ rates A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a lowered significantly over a period of three years as well as already after a year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ rates ( see Table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ rates compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ sis A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a showed a constant effect over three years , which resulted in a decrease of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of frac@@ tures .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased the bone density of lum@@ bar spine , hips and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo @-@ treatment significantly to all time points ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ asing the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine at 6.7 % , the total th@@ igh at 6.0 % , the spro@@ cket by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis which were treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third yearly dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es were taken from the pel@@ vic eye .
a micro@@ computer@@ ized ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed in with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients compared to placebo an increase in the advanced bone volume and gran@@ ting the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture .
bone mar@@ ker The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale pro@@ pep@@ tide of the type I@@ - coll@@ agen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ t@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum samples were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 246 patients during study period .
treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output rate after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value of 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not measured by rout@@ in@@ ely , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
overall mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study , the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment increased the BM@@ D to the total th@@ igh and scra@@ per @-@ h@@ ubs at all time points .
the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment led to placebo for 24 months compared to placebo @-@ treatment to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.4 % at the total th@@ igh and 4.3 % at the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as .
clinical efficacy in men In the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study were randomised , and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures amounted to 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.7 % in placebo .
in another study involving men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of al@@ end@@ ast@@ a showed the percentage change in the lum@@ bar spine BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was studied in patients and patients aged over 30 years with a radical Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2,@@ 6@@ fold up to 3,@@ 0@@ fold @-@ specific upper normal value in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in comparison to taking 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months was proved in two six months compar@@ ative studies .
the results for the combined results was observed after 6 months , a similar decrease in pain @-@ strength and pain @-@ influence was observed in comparison to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified at the end of the six months main study ( on the therapy had been addressed ) could be recorded in a follow @-@ up period .
of the 143 by A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and the 107 with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate treated patients who were involved in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response in 141 of patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared with 71 of patients with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate treated patients , could be maintained in an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dos@@ is@@ ir@@ respective .
after that , the plasma concentration rose quickly to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value to 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long lasting phase of very low concentrations , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
fast @-@ phase of disappearance from the big cycle with half times t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t 1 / 87 hours , followed by a long Eli@@ min@@ ation phase with an termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early phases phases ( α and β , with the above 1 / 2 values above ) represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the dose of urine is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly linked to bone tissue .
the total body @-@ Clear@@ ance is regardless of the dose of 5.@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eic acid - concentration by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the area below the curve ( plasma cent@@ ration against time ) .
a dimin@@ ished clearing of metabolic substances is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid does not metabolic disorders , and because it is a weak or not / or ir@@ reversible , substance @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) the ren@@ al clearing of the c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance and was measured in the average of 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
as a result , a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function can be down to a Kre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min .
due to severe kidney problems ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are available for this population .

decre@@ asing blood levels of sex hormones , above all est@@ rogen , who are formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradu@@ al loss of bone mass that is monitored in men .
while the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get takes place the bone structure quickly , and new bone material is un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material we@@ aker than normal .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a has an effect as norm@@ alized the bone structure , giving a normal bone formation and thus lending the bone once again .
if you are interested in dental treatment or under@@ go dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
for use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a with other drugs , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ists or care staff if you are taking other drugs / apply or used recently , even if it is not prescription drugs .
for your doctor it is particularly important to know if you are taking medicines , of which it is known to damage the kidneys .
for use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a together with food and beverages , you are concerned that you take sufficient liquid in accordance with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a &apos;s instructions before and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
o@@ steopor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , which is administered by your doctor or care staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
if you recently have broken the hips , it is recommended to take the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip @-@ break .

A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA is also applied to a diet and movement for the treatment of adult patients suffering from obesity ( body mass index - BMI ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or • which are overweight ( BMI of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond .
there were also four trials performed on more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was employed in comparison to a placebo as supp@@ or@@ tive funds for the setting of smoking .
in contrast to studies of smoking , no uniform results showed that the effect of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was difficult to estimate this application area .
what risk is associated with A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA ? it is the most common side effects of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA , which were observed during studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and upper respiratory infection were observed in connection with A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA and adverse reactions to the package .
it may not be used in patients that suffer from an existing severe depression or treated with anti@@ depress@@ ants , as it can intensi@@ fy the risk of depression and , among other things , in a small minority of patients &quot; su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public the present document is a summary of the European Public Service Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the conducted studies to make recommendations concerning the application of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabe@@ tic medication ) can be applied together with another di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medication ( dual therapy ) .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) , that can &apos;t be adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fa drugs or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ glyc@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced to the dose of sul@@ fon@@ ylene or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be utili@@ zed better and the blood sugar level has to be adjusted better , making type 2 diabetes better .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was investigated ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ phon@@ yl har@@ n@@ bone , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ kos@@ y@@ li@@ zed ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value which suggests that blood sugar levels have been reduced from 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sul@@ fon@@ ylene in a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values increased by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional administration of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin were examined in 289 patients , patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin values increased by 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who took placebo in addition .
the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were bl@@ ur@@ red vision , upper respiratory tract infections ( cold , col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thes@@ ia ( decreased sensitivity to friction ) .
Ac@@ tos can neither be used in patients who may be inv@@ alid ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other ingredients , still in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high level of ket@@ ones - blood pressure ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos in the context of a mon@@ otherapy ( in general use ) is supposed to serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
in October 2000 , the European Commission awarded the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for placing Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white to white , round , ar@@ ched and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; ACT@@ OS . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate and in@@ sufficient for contra@@ indications or toler@@ ability ( see section 4.4 ) .
for use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , so the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treating the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase dosage .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insulin .
cardiovascular Out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on patients suffering from patients below 75 years with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and existing mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was performed .
in this study , an increase in reports about heart failure , however , did not result in an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output of Li@@ ver Enzy@@ mes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on may not be used .
if the AL@@ T @-@ mirror increase up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver @-@ enzyme values are as soon as possible again .
if a patient is developing symptoms that point out to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ clari@@ fied nausea , vomiting , upper @-@ degra@@ dation , ti@@ redness , loss of appetite and / or dark har@@ ness , the liver enzy@@ mic values are checked .
the decision whether the treatment of patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on continued , should be conducted by the laboratory parameters of the clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , a dos@@ ing @-@ dependent weight gain has been demonstrated , which is her@@ e@@ ased by fatty deposits and in some cases linked to fluid re@@ ten@@ tion .
as a result of a hem@@ odi@@ lution at Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on a minor reduction in intermediate hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in compar@@ atively controlled trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ins at 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensi@@ tivity in patients receiving pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ phon@@ yl har@@ n@@ bone or dual @-@ combination therapy with insulin @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
after the market launch of the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , there was an appearance or a deteri@@ oration of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescribed doctors should be aware of a mac@@ ular ede@@ ma if patients should report on distur@@ ban@@ ces of the vision .
in a summary analysis of messages un@@ wanted events relating to bone mar@@ ries from randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in the PRO@@ ACT@@ IVE study , a study about 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frames per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on patients , compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
patients should be aware of a pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy , or if a patient is a pregnancy , the treatment is decre@@ asing ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on the investigation of inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on had no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with medicines that are metabol@@ ised by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or are not expected .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with the fibro@@ us@@ ci@@ on ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on about 3 times .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a lowering of AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which reduces hyper@@ insulin sensitivity and increased insulin resistance of the parent , and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic rate for the fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from present data not appreciated ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the Tur@@ g@@ ors and the re@@ inde@@ xes of the lens , as they may also be observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic drugs .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege came across three times the upper limit of the standard range , commonly referred to as placebo , but more rarely than in compar@@ ative groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ ylene .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with previously advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was the frequency of severe heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on about 1.6 % higher than under placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on bz@@ w .
since the market launch has rarely been reported on heart failure at Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , but more frequently if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the history .
a summary analysis of messages un@@ wanted events relating to bone mar@@ ries from randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients in patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients in patients treated with compar@@ ative medi@@ ation groups .
over a period of 3.5 years of current PRO@@ ACT@@ IVE study , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated patients compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
on taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on appears on an activation of specific Core @-@ recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ eton cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on increases the glucose production in the liver and increases the periph@@ eral glucose ranking in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy has been continued for two years to investigate the time of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8,0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in 69 % of the patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) .
in a placebo controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was in@@ sufficient despite three @-@ day phase with insulin , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo randomised .
in patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - worth 0.@@ 45 % , compared with the patients who had continued to receive insulin ; a reduction of insulin were observed in the group of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
in clinical trials over a year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on showed a statistically significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ves compared to the initial values .
the effect of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 weeks study on type 2 diabetes .
in most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel and low , however clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced the total plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol .
compared to Pla@@ z@@ ebo , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on there was no statistically significant increase in L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel , while under met@@ form@@ in and g@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d dimin@@ ished values .
in a study conducted over 20 weeks of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on also improved the post @-@ den@@ dial tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , this also improved over an effect on the tri@@ glyc@@ eride absorption as well as to the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ glyc@@ eride synthesis .
in the PRO@@ ACT@@ IVE study , a cardiovascular disease , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and previously existing mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ cular disease were random@@ ized in groups of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular disease either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo .
after oral applications , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is res@@ orted quickly , with the leading concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on plasma , usually 2 hours after application .
based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV represents the effectiveness in roughly three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with fibro@@ sis ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma cent@@ ration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral applications of radioactive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans the mar@@ ker was found mainly in the foot ( 55 % ) and to a lower extent in the har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the mean Plasma @-@ Eli@@ min@@ ation Day of Un@@ changeable Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the total active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma cent@@ rations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function , lower than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral Clear@@ ance of Our Lady &apos;s substance is similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies , in mice , rats , dogs and ap@@ es coinci@@ de after repeated administration of Plas@@ ma@@ Volume enlargement , with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible heart hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e .
this is due to the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which reduces hyper@@ insulin sensitivity and increased insulin resistance of the parent , and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic rate for the fet@@ al growth .
in long term studies ( up to 2 years old ) the rat increased incidence of hypertension ( male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) of the u@@ rea epi@@ theli@@ um induced .
in a animal model of the familiar aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons resulted in an increased frequency of col@@ ont@@ ology .
the tablets are white to white , round , flat and carry on a page the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; ACT@@ OS . &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in the PRO@@ ACT@@ IVE study , a study about 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frames per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on patients , compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in a further study about two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in each with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d were examined .
in clinical trials over 1 year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on showed a statistically significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ves compared to the initial values .
in a study of over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on did not only reduce the post@@ ure tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , but also improved the post @-@ dial tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , this both have an effect on tr@@ y@@ gly@@ z@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as to the h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ roy@@ d synthesis .
although the study was lacking in regard to its primary end@@ point , a combination of the overall mort@@ ality , non @-@ le@@ thal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial syndrome , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ar@@ er Rev@@ as@@ kul@@ ar@@ isation and Rev@@ as@@ kul@@ ar@@ isation and Rev@@ as@@ kul@@ ar@@ isation and Rev@@ as@@ kul@@ ar@@ isation , lay the results near that the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on do not constitute a cardiovascular risk .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was tested on a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is not able to use insulin effective .
in the study , after 12 weeks , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ kos@@ y@@ li@@ zed ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror that pointed out that blood sugar levels were similar to a loss of human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients who may possibly react sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other ingredients .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane must be adapted , if it is administered along with a number of other drugs that can affect the blood sugar ( the complete list is to be stored ) .
the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ ers ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane decrease in the treatment of diabetes across the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission announced Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S , a permit for placing Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane on the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect is desired with a longer lasting effect .
the injection pin must be used under the skin at least 6 seconds to ensure that the whole dose inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar is clearly improved by an intensive insulin therapy , the hypo@@ glyc@@ emia warning symptoms can be changed and should be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast @-@ effective , bi@@ phase , long @-@ acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA compared to insulin @-@ animal origin ) can result in a change in dosage .
if changing to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in patients a dose @-@ adjustment is required , it may be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after conversion .
a few patients who occurred hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after a change from animal in human insulin were reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ glyc@@ emia were less pronounced or different than in their previous insulin .
before travelling , the patient should go on several times , the patient should refer to the advice of his physician , as such trips can lead , insulin and meals have to be applied or taken to other times .
the doctor must therefore consider possible inter@@ actions in therapy and his patients always ask for others from them recorded medicines .
4 ) hypo@@ glyc@@ emia as well as hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , which may occur at a non @-@ sufficient diabe@@ tic therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in u@@ ter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ glyc@@ emia may lead to loss of consciousness and / or sei@@ zu@@ res and end @-@ lasting dis@@ rup@@ tions of the brain function and even death .
diseases of the nervous system Gel@@ eg@@ ated - periph@@ eral neurop@@ athy A rapid improvement of glucose monitoring may be associated with complaints associated as acute painful Neu@@ rop@@ athy and normally reversible .

diseases of the skin and the under@@ skin cell tissue - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y In the injection station , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y may arise when switching into the injection unit within the injec@@ tor .
general disorders and complaints at the appointment of funds - local hyper@@ sensitivity to the injection station During the insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity may occur ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) .
diseases of the immune system Gel@@ eg@@ aria - Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ gling Very rare - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , it@@ ching , sweat , gastro@@ intestinal disorders , angi@@ on@@ eur@@ otic membrane , respiratory problems , pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and fain@@ ting / consciousness .
however , a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can be progres@@ sively developed : • Glu@@ ing hypo@@ glyc@@ emia can be treated by the oral supplements of glucose or glucose foods .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape pieces , sweets , biscuits , or sugar fruit juice in themselves . • Heavy @-@ gly@@ cem@@ et@@ ons with loss of consciousness are treated with intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven help ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or glucose by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum concentration will reach within 2 to 8 hours , and the entire duration is up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The res@@ or@@ ption profile lies in it that it is a mixture of insulin products with faster or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a range of divisions ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were moved into consideration ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
based on conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity for carcin@@ ogenic potential , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , for carcin@@ ogenic potential and reproductive sto@@ icity , the pre @-@ clinical data can detect no particular dangers for humans .
it is recommended - after the acet@@ ph@@ ane passage from the fridge was taken from the refrigerator - the temperature of the insulin is expected to rise at room temperature ( not over 25 ° C ) before the use of the operating instructions for the first use .

acet@@ pi@@ d may not be used in patients who may be in@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other ingredients .
in addition , the cans of acet@@ pi@@ d may be adapted , if it is administered along with a number of other drugs that can affect the blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission announced Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S , a permit for placing Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d in the entire European Union .
if two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of the fast @-@ effective insulin must be brought up , then the amount of the long @-@ effective insulin .
3 If changing to Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d when patient is required , it may be necessary for the first dose or in the first weeks or months after conversion .
before travelling , the patient should go on several times , the patient should refer to the advice of his physician , as such trips can lead , insulin and meals have to be applied or taken to other times .
5 General disorders and complaints at the appointment of the public - local hyper@@ sensitivity to the injection station During the insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity may occur ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape pieces , sweets , biscuits , or sugar fruit juice in themselves . • Heavy @-@ gly@@ cem@@ et@@ ons with loss of consciousness are treated with intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven help ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or glucose by the doctor .

if the u@@ rea output is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ite , the dose can be increased to a daily dose of 120 mg every day .
during the first treatment months still present cases still occur , it is recommended that patients should be taken at least during the first six months under the treatment of Aden@@ ur@@ ic nor any other medicines for the prevention of plaster .
the medicine is not recommended in children and patients who had an organ transplan@@ t , as it was not examined for these groups .
in the first trial of which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with a placebo ( hypo@@ medi@@ ator ) and of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( other medicines for the treatment of Hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used twice daily in a dose of 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
main indicators for efficacy was the number of patients whose u@@ rea @-@ acid blood was administered in the blood for the last three measurements below 6 mg / dl .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) patients receiving Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 from 269 ) of patients who once had 120 mg of total a u@@ rea production in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in contrast , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients below the placebo .
the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diarrhea , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
in particular in patients suffering heart dis@@ comfort , an increased risk of certain side effects , which affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the lowering of the u@@ rea production in the blood more effective than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side @-@ effects related to the heart and blood vessels .

clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was described in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in every study the proportion of patients with which the last three monthly serum levels were &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EL@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EL@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) , AD@@ EL@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with an serum risk value of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / d@@ L .
the AP@@ EX @-@ Study showed a statistically significant amount of su@@ peri@@ ority under 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ l / l ) ( see Table 2 and Figure 1 ) which is statistically significant exc@@ essi@@ vely both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to conventional used doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
with regard to the permanent lowering of the serum , the F@@ ACT study showed statistically significant improvement in the treatment with AD@@ EL@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EL@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with the conventional recommended dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the lowering of the serum tum@@ bler on &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ l / l ) was observed during the physician &apos;s visit in week 2 and maintain permanently throughout the treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ bit@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum levels &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney @-@ dys@@ functions The AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness in 40 patients with kidney @-@ based limitation ( i.e. h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy point was achieved at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there was no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of the percentage of serum concentration in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney problems ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ eic acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years from the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the permanent lowering of the serum levels increased to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ l / l ) a decrease of incidence of tox@@ ins ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a g@@ ask@@ et ) .
this was associated with a reduction of gyp@@ sum size , which 54 % of patients had a complete disappearance of gre@@ ed no@@ des up to month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - Val@@ ues ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also received patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in open long@@ time extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers the maximum plasma cent@@ er@@ rations ( C@@ max ) and the area under the Plas@@ ma@@ on@@ zent@@ aci@@ al period ( AU@@ C ) of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at after administration was easier and multi@@ pler doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed , which is greater than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase .
after taking easier or multiple doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max amounts to 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage of serum concentration was observed , provided this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ SS / F ) of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at is between 29 and 75 l , after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma cl@@ amp of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration of concentration that is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ ites showed that these oxid@@ ative metabolism are primarily formed by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 , and that in accordance with U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are incub@@ ated ) in women after men@@ opause , a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must use the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drink or use other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid a irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient should not place until after the first dietary intake of the day , which should not take before 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 are already used separately in pharmac@@ euticals , which are approved in the European Union , the company presented data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also introduced a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis to demonstrate the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D sp@@ ies .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , less ( 11 % ) than for those who have obtained only Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) .
in addition , the company also presented data that the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose that is needed for preventing a bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal ( muscle , bone or joints ) and symptoms of digestive apparatus such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( digestive problems ) , ul@@ cers , diar@@ rhoea ( swal@@ low stress ) , infl@@ ated abdom@@ en ( b@@ lown stomach ) and sour cherries .
in patients with severe hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D3 or one of the other components should not be used AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
it may not be applied to diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( small calcium levels ) or in patients who stand for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following hin@@ ts are exactly to follow in order to reduce the risk of ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stim@@ ulation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swallowed up only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or the tablet in the mouth , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not take place before taking the tablet at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal ble@@ edings or surgical intervention in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ b@@ op@@ last@@ y , only among particular caution will be given ( see section 4.3 ) .
Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al gra@@ c@@ tures , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al cords , were reported in patients suffering from Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partially these severe and required a hospital ) .
this is why the doctor should attention attention to all signs and symptoms that should be pointed out on potential ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ie , pain when swal@@ lowing or retro@@ sp@@ inal pain or a new or ref@@ using so@@ d@@ burn the medicine and take medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of severe ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the onset of symptoms that refer to a ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important to pass all of the dos@@ ages to patients and be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in large clinical trials with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk was found , rare ( after market introduction ) and du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , were reported ( see section 4.8 ) .

there are no data available to give the indications , whether the exp@@ ose of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who require a lower surgical procedure , reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis of the ja@@ w .
clinical assessment by the treatment doctor is significant for treatment planning in all patients based on an individual benefit risk evaluation .
patients should depend on taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to take the tablet in the next morning after taking their sec@@ rec@@ y .
you should not take two tablets on the same day , but taking a tablet per week as originally planned on the planned week@@ day .
other illnesses that affect the metabolism ( such as vitamin D @-@ lack and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) , should also be treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE before the start of therapy .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at food and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can affect the absorption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at when they are taken at the same time .
therefore , patients after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at should wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not performed , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was used in clinical trials with a variety of usually c@@ ashed drugs , without being clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore neither to apply to pregnant women during pregnancy .
animal studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at do not allow any indication of directly to detect the pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .

since tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Progra@@ mmer / Progra@@ mmer has already been used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously implemented studies with programming / programming and data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study was presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , with the application of Ad@@ vag@@ raf with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ mmer or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients who was triggered by a year after a treatment duration of a year ( by example , as often an extended organ transplan@@ t or a recovery of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
further studies on 119 patients with kidney disease transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t were performed and studied , such as Ad@@ vag@@ raf in comparison to Progra@@ f / Progra@@ mmer is taken from the body .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ ts , should prescri@@ be this drug or prescri@@ be changes in immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us this may lead to transplan@@ tation , or to an increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or hyper@@ immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; settings of the formulation or regim@@ es should only be performed under the eng@@ aging of an experienced medical device ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
as a result of a conversion to alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose custom@@ iz@@ ations must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains .
dosage &quot; dosage should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of output and toler@@ ability in the individual and blood @-@ level regulations ( see below ) .
after conversion of progra@@ f on eagle , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ spiegel should be controlled before conversion and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , comparable to both controls both in kidney and transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and re@@ peti@@ tive controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ spiegel are recommended during the first two weeks of transplan@@ tation under ad@@ oration to ensure reasonable substance exposure in the immediate after@@ care phase .
as Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with lower Clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the vaginal sex @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as may take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
in case of the patient &apos;s condition in the first post @-@ operative phase , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment was administered intraven@@ ously ( Progra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate on the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
the application for supp@@ ression of transplan@@ tation must be maintained ; consequently , the immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression has to be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .

other dose custom@@ iz@@ ations can be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us may change in the course of stabili@@ zation of patients after transplan@@ tation .
dose recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft treatment of transplan@@ ting Ad@@ vaginal therapy should start with 0,@@ 10 - 0,@@ 20 mg / kg / day than once daily gift in the morning .
Dos@@ is@@ recommendation - conversion of programming to Ad@@ vag@@ raf must be converted to an daily intake of progra@@ ming capsules twice daily , this change@@ over in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) relative to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ t after a transition from other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants . once a day the treatment with the recommended initial dose for transplan@@ ting and liver transplan@@ tation must commen@@ ce for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ tation .
heart transplan@@ t At adult patients who are met in vaginal sex is an oral initi@@ ating dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day a day to take in the morning .
other transplan@@ t recei@@ vers Al@@ though there is no clinical experience with ad@@ jec@@ raf in a oral surgical dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and an oral transplan@@ t dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose custom@@ iz@@ ations in special care groups patients with reduced liver function To maintaining blood mirror in the targeted area may be required in patients with severe liver function , a reduction of dose needed .
patients with reduced kidney function as the kidney function has no influence on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics by tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it may be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ otic potenti@@ als of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular Det@@ er@@ esis of the ser@@ um@@ at@@ in@@ insp@@ iegel , calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins and monitoring of the u@@ rea volume ) is recommended .
change@@ over of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Ad@@ vag@@ raf in the conversion of a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is not recommended ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations for the Tal@@ ks in Voll@@ bl@@ ut The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of breakdown and toler@@ ability in the case of use of full bl@@ ut Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us slow@@ ing controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ spiegel during the first two weeks of transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic inspec@@ tions during the maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ Tal@@ ks of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be checked after conversion of progra@@ f on eagle , Dos@@ is@@ custom@@ ization , modification of immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ sive therapy , or for simultaneous use of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us whole blood concentrations ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Ad@@ vaginal raf a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adap@@ tations of the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State collapsed .
the data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the valley levels have not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the tac@@ kles levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us usually lie in the first time after liver transplan@@ tations in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with gl@@ ands - and hear@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent replacement therapy of liver , kidney and cardiac transplan@@ ts , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including transplan@@ tation , or other side effects , which can appear in succession of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over@@ ex@@ position .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; settings of the formulation or regim@@ es should only be performed under the eng@@ aging of an experienced medical device ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ tation , which has been proven to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants as therapies , there are no clinical data for ret@@ ard@@ ent formulation .
in the proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft reactions in adult heart transplan@@ ting singers and transplan@@ t recei@@ vers , however , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ard@@ ant formulation .
due to possible inter@@ actions which may lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ular mirror in the blood and a we@@ aker of the clinical effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements , St John &apos;s wort ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) is included , or other plant products during treatment with ad@@ oration ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rhoea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ular concentrations in the blood is provided , as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood mirrors can be subject to significant fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , a program called Kar@@ di@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was called Kammer@@ - or Sept@@ em@@ hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e , which can therefore be found under Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical distur@@ ban@@ ces are an existing heart disease , a treat with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function , infections , fluid load and oils .
like with other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants , the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of solar control with a high protection factor .
if patients that are taking Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for pre@@ aches like head@@ aches , changed consciousness conditions , sei@@ zu@@ res and bl@@ ur@@ red vision should show a radical examination ( e.@@ g ) .
since Ad@@ vag@@ raf Hart@@ kap@@ ass , ret@@ ard@@ ants , lact@@ ose contain , is special caution with the rare her@@ edit@@ ary g@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lact@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption special caution .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal medicinal products , which are known as inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 may affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and reduce the flow values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ tics blood mirror with the same gift of substances that can alter the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose for maintaining higher concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strong interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ iner@@ az@@ ole , it@@ az@@ ole , ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ mine ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the rise of blood levels mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal pollution .
high @-@ dose pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in acute remedy reactions , increase the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us &apos;s effect on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as the CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; hence the simultaneous use of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with drugs which are met@@ al@@ igned with CY@@ P3@@ 42 metabolic metabolism .
as Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us put down the Clear@@ ance of Ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a and therefore the hormone ex@@ position can increase is particularly cau@@ tious in decisions about recep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal trials have shown that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ on and can extend their half @-@ time .
the results of a minor number of investigations on transplan@@ tations provide no indication that in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants , an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and result of pregnancy exists .
during u@@ ter@@ o exposure , supervision of the new@@ born child is recommended to event@@ ual adverse effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ cali@@ ber of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns ) , i.e. :
the side @-@ effective profile of immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants can often be observed because of the patient &apos;s disease and the same treatment with a variety of other medicines .
the side effects after their frequency in desc@@ ending order is very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency on the available data is not inv@@ al@@ u@@ able ) .

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases How well @-@ known to other highly effective immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants is treated in patients that are treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the vulner@@ ability of infection ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , prot@@ o@@ zo@@ ale ) frequently .
cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated progressive multi@@ focal neuro@@ co@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ therapy , including therapy with ad@@ oration .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant Ne@@ op@@ ia including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymph@@ opro@@ lifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors in conjunction with the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ zed .
mode of action and pharmac@@ ologically dynamic effects on molecular levels are likely to be convey@@ ed by the effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us by its binding to a cy@@ n@@ ical protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cell &apos;s cell .
this leads to a cal@@ ming dependent inhibit@@ or of signal transaction due to the T @-@ cell and prevents the tran@@ scription of a specific number of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ kin genes .
Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of T cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) and the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

175 l@@ ung@@ ed patients , with 4@@ 75 patients who underwent a pan@@ kre@@ al transplan@@ tation , and in 630 cases were used as a primary immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ant in 630 cases .
in total , the safety profile of oral programming in these published studies revealed the observations among large studies in which programming in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ting recei@@ vers were used for primary immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression .
lung transplan@@ tation In a interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi @-@ center study with oral programming has been reported in more than 110 patients , which received either tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ ine .
chronic transplan@@ tation , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis o@@ blast syndrome , was also less frequently observed in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after a year amounted to 80@@ ,@@ 8 % in the Tac@@ tics Group and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
patients treated with the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us patients were treated in 2@@ 1,7 % of cases for the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis in comparison to 3@@ 8.0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0,0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ us had to be converted to Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 0.@@ 02 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0.0@@ 2 ) , was significantly higher ( p = 0.0@@ 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) .
the number of cases where no acute transplan@@ tation came , was increased after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) and after 1 year ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in a study the frequency of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was iter@@ ative , treated with the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us patients .
Pan@@ cre@@ ast@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation A multi @-@ center study with oral programming has been carried out for 205 patients , which simultaneously received a random@@ ized method Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral Initi@@ al@@ dose ( per protocol ) by Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us amounted to 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then followed by the target group of 8 to 15 ng / ml at 5 .
intestinal transplan@@ t The published clinical results of a mono@@ cent@@ ric study with oral transplan@@ ts showed 155 patients ( 65 only gut , 75 liver and intest@@ ines and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ mic transplan@@ ts ) under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one an update of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rite level and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the un@@ bound group of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids to be responsible for transplan@@ tation observed at higher Clear@@ ance rates .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely metabolic before the ex@@ cre@@ tion , and the ex@@ cre@@ tion primarily takes place above all .
for stable patients receiving programmes ( twice a day ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) relative to the total daily dose , the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was almost 10 % lower than under programming .

advances will be used to treat and prevention of bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a defect caused by the lack of factor VIII ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application apply after the treatment of bleeding or prevention of bleeding in surgical interventions .
patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor of VIII deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ots such as bleeding in the joints , muscles , or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but according to a method described as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of the human body factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate is a different product approved in the European Union called Recom@@ bin@@ ate , similar , but is otherwise manufactured , so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe chronic h@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study involving 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was investigated for prevention of bleeding and surgical interventions .
in the main study the efficacy of advances in the prevention of bleeding within 86 % of 510 % from 510 new blood sep@@ tics were awarded with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good &quot; respectively .
the most common adverse events of Adv@@ ices ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are dizziness , headache , Py@@ rex@@ ia ( fever ) and formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
advances must not be applied in patients who may be inv@@ alid ( allergic ) against the human scent factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster protein , or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG approval for marketing proposals in the entire European Union .
dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy are directed after the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ deficiency , according to the location and the extent of blood and the clinical state of patients .
for the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor of VIII &apos;s factor should not fall under the specified plasma concentration ( in % of the norm or in i.e. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute imp@@ air@@ ment eliminated .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 to 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk is over .
during the treatment process , the dose of injec@@ ting dose and frequency of injec@@ tions of the factor VIII , plasma concentration is required .
individual patients can differ in their response to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and feature different half times .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 , of factor VIII per kg body weight in a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII is not achieved , or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out to investigate an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that factor VIII is not effective so that other therapeutic interventions must be avoided .
the administration speed is expected to judge after the patient &apos;s request , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alising antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known compensation in treating patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ posi@@ tional activity of factor VIII , Ig@@ G Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da Ass@@ ay .
the risk of developing In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk is based on the biggest and other factors within the first 20 Ex@@ positions .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 Ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or@@ ant , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII @-@ product to another , the recovery of ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurr@@ ence of the hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast@@ feeding .
the A@@ DR@@ s contained in the greatest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) that were all in previously untreated patients who have increased higher risk for formation of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and dizziness ( 3 patients each ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of available data is not inv@@ al@@ u@@ able ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of individual patients ( 234 ) ( b ) The unexpected waste of the blood cl@@ ots factor VIII ( 10 - 14 post @-@ operative day ) in one patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ung was maintained during all the time and the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in plasma and the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values on the 15th post @-@ operative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnostic heavier hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and prior exposure to a factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient after 26 Ex@@ positions with A@@ DV@@ ATE showed a low in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or@@ ti@@ ter ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition , none of the 53 p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ rics patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnostic hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) was found by prior exposure to V@@ II@@ I@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or .
previously untreated clinical study were 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the immune response of patients suffering from contam@@ inated proteins was analyzed by the investigation of antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of antibodies against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise no signs or symptoms based on an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
four patients were set up on the appearance of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophi@@ c gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes in several re@@ peti@@ tive product positions within the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE has been reported in an allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ( frequency is not known ) .

normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( tissues , which combines other structures in the body , ren@@ ders and reli@@ es ) of it .
this is a type of virus , genetically modified so that it can bear a gene into the body &apos;s cells .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ ovirus &quot; that has been changed so that there is no copies of itself , and therefore no infections can trigger in humans .
Adv@@ ex@@ in should be inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ours and allow cancer cells to re @-@ form normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the non @-@ defect in the human body &apos;s existing p@@ 53 gene , normally contributes to restore DNA and kill cells , if the DNA can not be restored .
in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient prior to the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of under@@ mining , into the bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP had examined the answers from the company on which questions were reviewed yet , some issues were un@@ resolved .
based on the inspection of initially submitted documents , CH@@ MP has compiled a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
the CH@@ MP &apos;s opinion was not sufficiently demonstrated that advances in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors bring advantages to patients .
the committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration as well as the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company had not demonstrated that advances in reliable way can be produced and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient , is harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company did not comply with the CH@@ MP , whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; modified drugs &quot; means that the tablets have been composed so that one of the effective components should be released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours .
Aer@@ in@@ aze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal rhin@@ itis ( hay fever , caused by a allergy against p@@ ollen ) in patients with nas@@ al s@@ mu@@ g s@@ mu@@ g ( c@@ logged nose ) .
in adults and adolescents 12 years , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ aze is twice a tablet twice daily , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of treatment should be as short as possible and ended when the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the drug may be ref@@ using to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the most effective measurements were the changes of the sever@@ ity of the hypo@@ cris@@ p symptoms that were reported in the patient before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
at contempl@@ ation of all hay fever symptoms except for con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ aze &apos;s symptoms over a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al s@@ mu@@ cos@@ a showed , patients with Aer@@ in@@ aze showed a reduction of symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients receiving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ aze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ ometer ( cardiac infections ) , phar@@ yn@@ gi@@ tis ( throat infections ) , phar@@ yn@@ gi@@ tis , headache , fatigue , insom@@ nia , insom@@ nia , insom@@ nia , insom@@ nia , insom@@ nia , insom@@ nia .
Aer@@ in@@ aze may not be inv@@ alid ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in or one of the other ingredients , against ad@@ ren@@ ous molecular entities or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin ( another drug for the treatment of allergies ) are not used .
Aer@@ in@@ aze may not be used in patients that suffer from hyper@@ ton@@ ic glaucoma ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ roid ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ roid ) , or have a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( caused by a cereb@@ ral bleeding ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on July 30 , 2007 , the European Commission granted auth@@ orization to SP Europe auth@@ orization for placing Aer@@ in@@ aze in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , it is used to swal@@ low ( i.e. without them to break or ch@@ ew ) .
Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to mis@@ alignment and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) for children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after closing the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as long @-@ term application can take the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in with time .
after the threshold of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract , treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy treatment required .
since Aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks after the end of such therapy .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity with combined use of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ tors such as Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ id , Lis@@ ur@@ ide , path@@ ologic or nas@@ al as a wave of rhin@@ ologi@@ ans ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , ast@@ o@@ olin , etc . ) .
safety and effectiveness of these combination therapy were not tested for this patient collective and the data are not sufficient to address relevant recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function , and the data are not sufficient to address relevant recommendations .
patients must be informed that the treatment at the appearance of hyper@@ ton@@ ic or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ma , or of pal@@ pit@@ ations , ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea or any other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or an ampli@@ fication of head@@ aches ) must be removed .
in treatment of the following patient groups , patients with cor@@ rhyth@@ mic diseases • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ ton@@ ic diseases • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the history of the history , diabetes mell@@ itus , bli@@ stering so@@ b@@ ation or bron@@ chi@@ ds in the history .
Aer@@ in@@ aze is at least 48 hours before carrying out the mat@@ ological testing , as anti@@ hist@@ amine otherwise prevent positive reactions on indicators for skin reactions or reduce their extent .
in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine of which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or alter@@ ations of the Plas@@ ma@@ on@@ zent@@ ration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test there were no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the placebo @-@ treated patients regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin alone or with alcohol was taken .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was not identified yet so that interaction with other drugs cannot be completely excluded .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bits and neither a sub@@ strate , or an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
the authentic@@ ity of the use of Aer@@ in@@ aze during pregnancy is not assured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of normal population .
since Re@@ production studies in animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tor properties of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in , Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be used in pregnancy .
the patients should be clari@@ fied , however , that in very rare cases , it can occur in very rare cases that can lead to an imp@@ air@@ ment of traffic resistance or the ability to serve machines .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S @-@ depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , dimin@@ ished spiritual attention , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular coll@@ aps ) and a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation ( insom@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ins .
head@@ aches , anxiety , frigh@@ tened Mik@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tensions , eu@@ ph@@ oric , arous@@ al , breathing heart failure , heart rhyth@@ mi@@ ties , pal@@ pit@@ ations , nausea , vomiting , preventive pain , dizziness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , bl@@ ur@@ red vision and hypertension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation is most likely in children , as well as at@@ roph@@ in typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dried , pop@@ up@@ li@@ ff , and di@@ lat@@ ation , hood , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ en , as well as the expression of the expression of the hem@@ or@@ us@@ ol@@ ec@@ ül@@ s P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ ine on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg has no effect on standard measurement sizes , including ampli@@ fication sub@@ jective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks that are associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 mg , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess was determined in comparison to placebo .
the oral application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine at the recommended dosage can cause any more sympath@@ etic effects , such as an increase of blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S exc@@ itation .
there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal rhin@@ itis , 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amin@@ ant@@ agon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets was determined based on the total score for the symptoms ( except s@@ no@@ o@@ idal s@@ skin ) , significantly higher than among a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets with regard to the de@@ pl@@ ating effect , determined by the nas@@ al s@@ mu@@ d@@ skin , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin .
in a single dose study on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ aze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin is present within 30 minutes after administration in plasma .
following the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ aze in healthy volunteers over 14 days the flow @-@ weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in day 10 was reached .
in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ disciplinary study which was carried out with the formulation of healthy adult patients , it was noted that four test subjects of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin badly dis@@ figured .
a component inter@@ act study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in according to the sole gift of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine is the exposure to the gift of a Aer@@ in@@ aze tablet .
based on the conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity for toxic@@ ity and reproductive sto@@ icity , the pre @-@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin may not recognize any particular dangers for humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally consistent with the ingredient P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in .
in re@@ produc@@ tion@@ sto@@ x@@ ic@@ ology studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the oral administration of rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and at a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day not ter@@ ato@@ gen .
March 2007 and module 1.@@ 8.1 of the approval application described by the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ amine contribute to the alle@@ vi@@ ating of allergic symptoms by preventing the hist@@ amine that can develop its effect .
aer@@ in@@ aze tablets have symptoms that occur in connection with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or ju@@ ck@@ ling nose and t@@ earing eyes with simultaneous con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
20 Under certain circumstances , you can be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ cos@@ a s@@ wollen medicines P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in , which is contained in this medicine .

tell your doctor if using Aer@@ in@@ aze &apos;s symptoms or diseases occur or diagnosed : • hypertension • heart hunting , pal@@ pit@@ ations • heart rhyth@@ mi@@ as , headache , headache , or an ampli@@ fication of existing head@@ aches .
when taking Aer@@ in@@ aze with other drugs , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if you take other medicines or have recently taken care of prescription drugs .
the recommended dosage and operation of machines in the recommended dosage is not to calculate that aer@@ op@@ last@@ y leads to ben@@ ign@@ ity , or down the attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ aze , as you should consult your physician or pharmac@@ ists if you have a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ aze than you should .
if you have forgotten the intake of Aer@@ in@@ aze If you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible , and apply the next dose to the planned date .

after the launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine it was very rare about cases of severe allergic reactions ( breath of breath , pf@@ ei@@ gh breathing , it@@ ching , ni@@ ching , and swelling ) or rash .
over cases of heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ ase , stomach pain , diarrhea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , dizziness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disorders , muscle aches , sei@@ zu@@ res , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , more about cases of liver infection and over cases of con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous liver values was also very rare .
it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - Ly@@ oph@@ is@@ at for inser@@ tion ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 m@@ g@@ - and 5 mg melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml @-@ syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for inser@@ ting .
for children aged 1 to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which is available in the form of 2.5 ml si@@ rup .
for children aged between six and eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 m@@ l. of syrup .
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four trials in seasonal rhin@@ itis and two trials in patients who also had asthma ) .
efficacy was measured by the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number , and size of qu@@ add@@ ling , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep and the performance in the day ) before and after six weeks treatment was determined .
there were further studies presented to verify that the body utili@@ zes the syrup , solution for inser@@ ting and melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the use of children are un@@ think@@ able .
in allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all trials were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptoms ( symptoms of symptoms ) by 25 to 26 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a placebo .
in both studies in Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease of the symptoms after six weeks was compared with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to placebo @-@ treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied to patients who may be inv@@ alid ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted auth@@ orization to SP Europe to implement A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are partial experience from clinical studies on the effectiveness in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of intermediate @-@ allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease process and can be resum@@ ed after the end of the symptoms and when the symptoms are resum@@ ed .
in the Persian allergic rhin@@ itis ( onset of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) patients can be recommended during the inf@@ ant time a lasting treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not determined in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets containing ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study at the same time taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol has not intensi@@ fied the performance of alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the patients should be clari@@ fied , however , that in very rare cases , it can occur in very rare cases that can lead to an imp@@ air@@ ment of traffic resistance or the ability to serve machines .
clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , when patients who were treated with placebo .
the most commonly found side effects related to placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth dry ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side of headache was treated at 5.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and 6.9 % of the patients treated with placebo .
in a multiple dose study where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were given , no clinical relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ en , as well as the expression of the expression of the expression of the expression on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a clinical study with multiple doses of up to 20 mg per day , a dose of up to 20 mg was administered daily for 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ovas@@ cul@@ um effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ th@@ less of the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .
in a single dos@@ is@@ - study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg has no effect on standard measurement sizes , including ampli@@ fication sub@@ jective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks that are associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis was A@@ eri@@ us effective in the alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ tion , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching , tear and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhin@@ itis can also be divided into an inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and Persian allergic rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
Persian allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the onset of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown on the basis of the overall scores of life on the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ished by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for further forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the under@@ lying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar to the different forms , and chronic patients can be recruited by a simple pro@@ spec@@ tively .
since the hist@@ am@@ ination is a significant factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin except for the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria also leads to other forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria to an improvement in the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria A@@ eri@@ us was effective for improving p@@ ur@@ itus and the composition of size and quantity of Qu@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dose intervals .
like in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ amine in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines , was excluded from the study .
an improvement of the it@@ ching bag by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin treated patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with as@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and vig@@ il@@ ant significantly , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for the assessment of these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients were comparable to the general seasonal Rhin@@ itis @-@ Population , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin was achieved in 4 % of patients .
there are no evidence for a clinical @-@ relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was not identified , however , that interaction with other drugs are not entirely excluded
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bits and neither a sub@@ strate , or an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
in a single dos@@ is@@ study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fet@@ tered , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) did not apply to the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin .
the clinical trials carried out by des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ adin who showed a comparable degree of exposure of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no qualitative or quantitative differences in terms of toxic@@ ity related by des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin .
based on the conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeat@@ ability , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and reproductive sto@@ icity , the pre @-@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin have no particular dangers for humans .
color film ( includes lact@@ ose mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , hy@@ pro@@ m@@ less , titanium dioxide , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 , color@@ oc@@ ar@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , color@@ less film ( contains hy@@ m@@ less , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , light wax .
A@@ eri@@ us may be taken independently of meals using allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the missing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data suggest treatment of infectious rhin@@ itis with as@@ eri@@ us .
besides the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis , physical examination and appropriate laboratory and skin examination should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of metabolic diseases are reduced and experienced a higher sub@@ sid@@ y load ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us syrup in children between 2 and 11 years , which are partly metabolic , is identical to children who are using normal .
this medication contains Sac@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with her@@ edit@@ ary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose absorption , or a su@@ cro@@ se @-@ Is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ - in@@ suffici@@ ency of this drug may not take the medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were detected in the context of clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets containing ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study at the same time taking as@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol has not intensi@@ fied the performance of alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the total incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group like the placebo group .
in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , when patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multiple dose study of adults and adolescents , up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( Ne@@ th@@ less clinical dose ) were given , no clinical relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 years , who came to question for an anti@@ hist@@ amine treatment in question , received a daily Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ indo@@ sis of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults and children can be extra@@ pol@@ ated in adults on the children &apos;s population .
in a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day was applied for 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ovas@@ cul@@ um effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ th@@ less of the clinical dose ) has been applied for ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess was determined in comparison to placebo .
in a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials were not imp@@ air@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ or .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol has neither resulted in a ampli@@ fication of alcohol @-@ induced power consumption , to an increase of drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adults and young patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in the alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ tion , no@@ stri@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching , tear and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .

in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria A@@ eri@@ us was effective for improving p@@ ur@@ itus and the composition of size and quantity of Qu@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dose intervals .
the prevalence of this restric@@ tive phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ c@@ asian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were detected in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ functional dose of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis , which are ob@@ tain@@ ted with metabolic rhin@@ itis .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin was about 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal time of approximately 120 hours .
there are no evidence of an clin@@ ically relevant drug cum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In different single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in the recommended doses were comparable to those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine syrup at a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was not identified , however , that interaction with other drugs cannot be completely excluded .

in June 2008 , Novartis V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. was officially distributed to the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) , that the company receives its application for approval from A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent cavi@@ ar H@@ 5@@ N1 influenza in adults and older men .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied for adults and older people to protect flu , caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of the Influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine , which might cause a trunk to the flu virus that could cause future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out if a new strain of the flu virus emerg@@ es that can easily spread human immun@@ ity , because people still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recogni@@ zes the parts of the influenza virus as &quot; body foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system is able to form an instant antibody in contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus was separated with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on membrane surface , det@@ ects the human body as body foreign ) , cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine .
inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
by this way , the scope of clinical data base for evaluation of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA region &apos;s guidelines for preventive vaccines .
should you take part in a clinical study and require further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor &apos;s doctor .
if you wish for further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is applied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ a stands as a solution to insert , but they cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination was not examined .
A@@ gener@@ a should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked the anti@@ viral drugs of the patient earlier , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood has judged that the virus will address the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients on twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , together with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral drugs .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ a depends on body weight .
A@@ gener@@ a reduces the HIV @-@ quantity in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs the HIV @-@ quantity in the blood and holds them at a low level .
AIDS does not cure AIDS , however , the damage of the immune system , and so that the development of HIV @-@ related infections and diseases can also be delayed .
A@@ gener@@ a was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , studied in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who previously had not been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ants .
this with low do@@ omed rite @-@ reinforced drugs A@@ gener@@ a was compared with 206 adult , which previously used prot@@ e@@ as@@ mine inhibit@@ ors , compared with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors .
main indicators for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ prov@@ able concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or change of the viral load after the treatment .
in the studies of patients who had previously had no prot@@ e@@ as@@ mine inhibit@@ or , after 48 weeks more patients had a virus last less than 400 copies / ml as under placebo , but A@@ gener@@ a was less effective than in@@ verteb@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ a also decreased the viral load , but with the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ mine , only very few were on the treatment .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ mine eyel@@ ids , the viral load increased after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other protagon@@ ist inhibit@@ or :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ e@@ as@@ mine inhibit@@ ors , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with a more powerful waste of the viral load after four weeks as in the patients receiving their previous prot@@ e@@ as@@ e.@@ inhibit@@ or :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhoea ( diarrhea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nausea ) , vomiting , skin rash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ a must not be applied in patients who may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ b@@ abo@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
A@@ gener@@ a can also not be used in patients , the St John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or pharmac@@ euticals , which are the same as A@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood of health .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who are taking A@@ gener@@ a , the risk of a pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ( alter@@ ations in the distribution of body fat ) , an o@@ ste@@ on@@ o@@ arthritis ( onset of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by which re@@ covers the immune system ) .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs are treated with HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
in general , A@@ gener@@ a is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amp@@ lif@@ iers , but the committee found that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with patients who had previously not demonstrated prot@@ e@@ as@@ mine inhibit@@ or .
A@@ gener@@ a was originally approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; since the approval of scientific reasons only limited information .
in October 2000 the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited made a permit for the placing of A@@ gener@@ a in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ a is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ anter@@ ior adult and children over 4 years .
for usually A@@ generic capsules are to be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r together with low doses of ritual cavi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r should take place under consideration of the individual vir@@ al resistance and treatment of patients ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r as a solution to insert is 14 % lower than in Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ generic capsules and solution to intake a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram is not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r twice daily together with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 . if A@@ generic capsules are used without the ampli@@ fication ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ a ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied twice daily .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 20 mg of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily average of 2400 mg of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ a in combination with low doses of K@@ nights or other protagon@@ ists were not studied in children .
A@@ gener@@ a is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the failure of data on the authentic@@ ity and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of ret@@ ase capsules in adult patients should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be carried out in patients with mild or moderate liver problems , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ a must not be given simultaneously with medicines that possess a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ en@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P3@@ A4 ) .
herbal supplements , which contain cur@@ wort ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plas@@ mak@@ ef@@ ulness and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r during intake of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
the patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ a or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that it continues to develop opport@@ un@@ istic infection or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including the A@@ gener@@ a , does not prevent the risk of transfer@@ ring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for usually A@@ generic capsules are to be used together with low doses of k@@ nights and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , have increased risk of severe liver inci@@ den@@ ies with potentially fatal processes .
for the case of an anti@@ viral viral treatment of hepatitis B or C please refer to the relevant technical information concerning this medicine .
patients with existing liver function including an chron@@ ically @-@ active hepatitis indicate increased frequency of liver function under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ a and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other glu@@ co@@ qu@@ or@@ rho@@ ids , which are being confused about CY@@ P3@@ A4 is not recommended , unless the potential benefit of treatment has a risk of systemic cor@@ tis@@ o@@ i@@ der effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the anne@@ x function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or of CY@@ P3@@ A4 is dependent on a simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ a with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including rh@@ ubar@@ b oly@@ mers .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International standardi@@ zation R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the concentration of drugs .
in patients who take this medicine at the same time , as@@ ur@@ ase may be less effective for reduced plasma concentration of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
because of the possibility of metabolic interaction with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a can be changed , however , information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interaction .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on ob@@ pi@@ at@@ al symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of k@@ nights .
due to the possible risk of a toxic@@ ity in toxic@@ ity due to the high prop@@ yl@@ ation content of the A@@ gener@@ a solution , this formulation of children under a age of four years is contra@@ indicated and should be applied to caution regarding certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ a should be set to 5 if a skin rash is accompanied by System@@ ic or allergic symptoms or are involved in the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( see section 4.8 ) .
patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , was reported on the onset of diabetes mell@@ itus , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia or an exc@@ itation of an existing diabetes mell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases , which were necessary medications were linked to the development of diabetes mell@@ itus or hyper@@ glyc@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated metabolic disorders associated with .
in h@@ amm@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ mine eyel@@ ids , reports on an increase of bleeding including spontaneous co@@ aches ha@@ em@@ ans and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sis .
at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al Opport@@ un@@ istic infection can result in severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi @-@ fac@@ t@@ orial eti@@ ology is accepted ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis , were reported in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P3@@ A4 sub@@ strate with low therapeutic width A@@ ret@@ ase cannot be given simultaneously with medicines that possess a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ a with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be used together with medicines , whose active ingredients are mainly related to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and associated with increased plasma bars with serious and / or threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and result in resistance development .
in the attempt to balance the humili@@ ation of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with ritual cavi@@ r , very often un@@ wanted effects were observed in the liver .
St John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r can be humili@@ ated by simultaneous use of vegetable preparations with cur@@ v@@ wort ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient is already taking cur@@ v@@ raut , the Am@@ bul@@ av@@ ir@@ lik@@ eness and , if possible to check the viral load and ab@@ duct the St John &apos;s wort .
a dose adjustment for any of the drug is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered along with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( see also E@@ lie@@ ve below ) .
508 % increased , for C@@ max at 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which occupy the efficacy and uncertainty of this treatment schemes .
52 % lower when Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of K@@ nights twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r in plasma , which have been reached in combination of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dos@@ ing recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can &apos;t be given , however , it is recommended to be eng@@ ined monitoring , because the effectiveness and uncertainty of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination , but is recommended due to the ant@@ acid component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , that the revenues of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ acids below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adap@@ tion is required .
treatment with irrit@@ ability in combination with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or would be er@@ low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin to other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin may be sun@@ k the serum concentration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r .
if this drug should be used at the same time , caution is advis@@ able because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din could be less effective because of the dimin@@ ished or potentially sub@@ therapeutic plasma bar .
if this drug is applied together , caution is provided ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical supervision should be made , as an accurate forecast the effect of the combination of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and k@@ nights on Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in Plas@@ ma@@ on@@ zent@@ ration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin , 193 % and thus an increase in Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin connected side effects .
if necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is necessary for clinical reasons , becoming a reduction in Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with asp@@ ir@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not executed , but could be increased by the plasma concentration of both medicines in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ sil@@ en@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to 2,@@ 69@@ times compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or In@@ duc@@ tors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 may , if they are used together with A@@ gener@@ a , may result in interaction .
therefore , patients should be connected to toxic reactions to be monitored by these drugs , if they are applied in combination with A@@ gener@@ a .
based on the data of other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or , it is advis@@ able that ant@@ acids can not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ a , as it can come to res@@ or@@ ption distur@@ ban@@ ces .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ va which are known as an enzyme duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r can result in a degra@@ dation of the plasma bar of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r .
the serum @-@ concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , di@@ lat@@ pin , Nic@@ ardi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ p@@ pin , ni@@ p@@ pin , ni@@ p@@ pin , ni@@ p@@ pin , ni@@ p@@ pin , ni@@ p@@ pin , ni@@ p@@ pin , ni@@ p@@ pin , ni@@ p@@ pin , di@@ aph@@ rag@@ pin , can be increased by Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of this drug .
simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ a can also increase their plas@@ mak@@ on@@ ations in connection with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection to the side effects including hyp@@ oten@@ sion , bl@@ ur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of test were given , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol increased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % reduction interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous Gift of A@@ gener@@ a with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended with these glucose concentrations , unless the potential benefit of treatment is the risk of systemic cor@@ tis@@ o@@ i@@ der effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
in H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or , such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose prolifer@@ ation of CY@@ P3@@ A4 is dependent , the plasma concentration of the plasma bar is expected to be present .
as Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ ration increases of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , including a rh@@ ubar@@ b oly@@ sis , the combined application of this drug may not be recommended with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r .
there will be a frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations up to stabili@@ zation of the mirror , as the plasma cent@@ rations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased with the same gift of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ a must not be used along with oral m@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while in simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ a with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other protagon@@ ists prove to a possible increase in plasma concentration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am for 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered along with Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on ob@@ pi@@ at@@ al symptoms , especially when they are given low doses of k@@ nights .
because of the toler@@ ability of historical compar@@ ability of historic compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given , such as Am@@ bul@@ av@@ ir@@ - dosage is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with the same gift of War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ies along with A@@ gener@@ a , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a we@@ aker or rein@@ forcement of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contra@@ ction is not predic@@ table , as well as alternative methods for contrac@@ eption is recommended .
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants ( such as des@@ i@@ pra@@ min and nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in the same gift of A@@ gener@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , during pregnancy , this drug may only be used to treat the possible risks for the mother compared to the possible risks of the fet@@ us .
in the milk lac@@ tic rats , Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r related substances were not known , however , it is not known whether Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r on human breast milk is over .
a reproductive study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the income in the u@@ terus at the end of the stagn@@ ation of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in 12 body weight during the stagn@@ ation period .
further development of the income including fer@@ til@@ ity and reproductive ability was not imp@@ acted by the administration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r on the mother &apos;s animal .
the in@@ ability of A@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase Treatment were light up to moderate , took up early and resulted in a rare case of treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether they are related to the treatment of A@@ gener@@ a or another at the same time for HIV treatment , or if they are a consequence of the disease disease .
most of the above @-@ mentioned side effects date from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) in which prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors were not treated 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ a twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were classified by the test in connection with study medication , and in more than 1 % of patients were performed , as well as under the treatment of laboratory changes ( grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
the anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with HIV patients ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ) in HIV patients , including a loss of periph@@ eral and fa@@ less fat tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e the breasts and dor@@ vi@@ vial fat accumulation ( Sti@@ ern@@ ing ) .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated people who had been treated with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ ud@@ in / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ in over a medium term of 36 weeks , only a case ( Sti@@ ern@@ ing ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , at 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ ER previously treated patients under Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 @-@ patients with in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ RT@@ Is about a medium duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
skin rash usually were mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ u@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred during the second course of treatment and disappeared spont@@ aneously within two weeks without having to be broken off with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r .
cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , an anti @-@ anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ atic or resistant opport@@ un@@ istic infection ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of pre @-@ treated patients that received 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ a twice daily along with low do@@ gmati@@ zed k@@ nights ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( grade 3 and 4 ) , which were among all@@ u@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and CP@@ K values that were treated in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase together with low do@@ gmati@@ zed k@@ nights .
in case of an over@@ bur@@ s@@ ation , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures are necessary .
Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and avo@@ ids the process of process vir@@ al g@@ ag@@ - and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ proteins present with the consequence of a formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as to periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ konzent@@ ration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 8 µm in infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm for chronic infected cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of the HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans are not defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently registered Fos@@ sil@@ en@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages - like in other rite @-@ related treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described only rarely were observed .
in the sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ sil@@ en@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure could be investigated by week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ic .
an gen@@ otyp@@ ical analysis of the ages of 13 of 14 children , with which a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure in the 59 were included , showed resistance samples which were similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , MP@@ 3@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , I@@ 54@@ W , I@@ 3@@ V , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 54@@ W , A@@ 7@@ 1@@ V , V@@ 77@@ I , I@@ 8@@ 2a / I , I@@ 84@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M , and I@@ 93@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 , an extension of AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ sil@@ en@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) with prot@@ e@@ as@@ mine eyel@@ ids previously treated patients with vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations on :
based on gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance based analyses of gen@@ otyp@@ ical interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ e.@@ inhibit@@ or isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ 11 @-@ Algorith@@ m for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , I@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 54@@ F and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with a reduced probability of an vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations can be subject to any additional data , and it is recommended to always draw the current interpre@@ tations to analyze the results of resistance tests .
based on ph@@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance based analyses in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical data analy@@ zing systems can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical data to estimate the activity of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ e.@@ inhibit@@ or isol@@ ates .
companies who sell diagnostic resistance tests have clin@@ ically developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ off@@ s ( divi@@ ders ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be applied to the interpretation of a resistance tests .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r associated genetic pattern generates a certain cross @-@ resistance against ritual cavi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r remain generally consistent .
there are currently data on the cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ants for all 4 Fos@@ sil@@ en@@ avi@@ r resistance fighters , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with which a Fos@@ sil@@ en@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ avi@@ r / ritual cavi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ avi@@ r / ritual cavi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 insul@@ ates ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ mine inhibit@@ ors ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and from the type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early departure of a reconc@@ iling therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in boundaries which can affect the following treatment .
the proof of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ a in combination with rite @-@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which PI treated twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ sid@@ an@@ alog@@ a ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard of nucle@@ o ( standard of care , So@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with a lower rite level .
one hundred thre@@ es@@ sixty @-@ sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the research study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis introduced the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time @-@ adjusted average changes from the initial value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ signat@@ ories of 0.4 logical 10 copies / ml .
the proof of the effectiveness of inde@@ xed A@@ gener@@ a is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ generic solution for intake and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low do@@ si@@ zing Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ RT@@ Is together with A@@ gener@@ a .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the study included a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) .
19 Based on these data should be considered to be considered the benefit of &quot; un@@ ble@@ aching &quot; A@@ gener@@ a in case of therapy optimization .
after oral administration , the average length ( T@@ max ) up to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increased , for C@@ max reduced by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) were administered along with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent supply volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and allows for a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ locked penetration of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r from the blood circulation into the tissues .
this change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of the effect in plasma , with the amount of un@@ coated Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ coated Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active changes in the ste@@ ady concentration in the ste@@ ady state across the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
this drug may therefore have to absorb or absorb the CY@@ P3@@ A4 or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , if they are given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ a ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r exposure such as adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r is from the solution 14 % less flexible than from capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ a solution and A@@ gener@@ a capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gramm@@ ar base .
also the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , hence the effect of ren@@ al function is likely to be reduced to the elimination of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and k@@ nights .
these treatments lead to am@@ b@@ abo@@ r @-@ plas@@ mas@@ cul@@ um comparable to those who were achieved in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r twice daily without simultaneous order of k@@ nights .
in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ icity with am@@ b@@ abo@@ o in mice and rats occurred with male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular Aden@@ ome with dos@@ ages to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of the exposure to humans , according to twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r .
the 21 under@@ lying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cell cellular Aden@@ ome and Kar@@ zin@@ ome has not been resolved and the relevance of this observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
however , from the present survey data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic application , however , little evidence for adop@@ ting a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ con@@ - and in @-@ vitro Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial reverse mutation test , micro@@ core test of rats and chromosome aber@@ rations at human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ox@@ ic .
these liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and detected in clinical use by measurement of AST , AL@@ T , and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
previously no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase even after the treatment .
studies of toxic@@ ity at young , which were treated at a age of 4 days , showed both in the control and also with am@@ b@@ abo@@ o @-@ treated animals a high mortality .
in case of systemic Plas@@ ma@@ ex@@ position , which was significantly higher ( rabbits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dose in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ self @-@ ong@@ ation and mar@@ gin@@ ous skel@@ etal changes were observed , which point to a delayed development .
24 If A@@ generic capsules are used without the amplifier addition of k@@ nights ( boo@@ bies ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ a ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied twice daily .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 20 mg of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily average of 2400 mg of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should occur in patients with low or lighter liver problems with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International standardi@@ zation R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the concentration of drugs .
A@@ gener@@ a should be set up to 27 if a skin rash is accompanied by System@@ ic or allergic symptoms or are involved in the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated metabolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and result in resistance development .
508 % increased , for C@@ max at 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r in plasma , which have been reached in combination of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dos@@ ing recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can &apos;t be given , however , it is recommended to be eng@@ ined monitoring , because the effectiveness and uncertainty of this combination is not known .
treatment with irrit@@ ability in combination with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or would be er@@ low .
if this drug is applied together , caution is provided ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical supervision should be made , as an accurate forecast the effect of the combination of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and k@@ nights on Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult .
if necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is necessary for clinical reasons , to reduce the dosage of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data .
the serum @-@ concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , di@@ di@@ pin , Nic@@ ardi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ pin , ni@@ p@@ pin , ni@@ p@@ pin , ni@@ p@@ pin , ni@@ p@@ pin , ni@@ p@@ pin , ni@@ p@@ pin , ni@@ p@@ pin , ni@@ p@@ pin , ni@@ p@@ pin , ni@@ p@@ pin , di@@ cel@@ ess , can be increased by am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of this drug .
in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of test were given , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol increased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % reduction interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with the same gift of War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ies along with A@@ gener@@ a , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a we@@ aker or rein@@ forcement of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg No@@ re@@ th@@ ind@@ ron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r by 22 % and respectively .
however , during pregnancy , this drug may only be used to treat the possible risks for the mother compared to the possible risks for the kill@@ us .
a reproductive study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the income in the u@@ terus until the end of the breast@@ feeding Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during im@@ perfection .
the in@@ ability of A@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of an over@@ bur@@ s@@ ation , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures are necessary .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ konzent@@ ration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 8 µm with acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm for chronic infected cells ( 1 µm = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ mine inhibit@@ ors ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and from the type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , treatment optim@@ isation is expected to be considered at the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ ble@@ aching &quot; A@@ gener@@ a .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ coated Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active changes in the ste@@ ady concentration in the ste@@ ady state across the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss ..
this drug may therefore have to absorb or absorb the CY@@ P3@@ A4 or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , if they are given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ a ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
also the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; hence the effect of ren@@ al function is likely to be reduced to the elimination of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and k@@ nights .
in long @-@ term studies on the carcin@@ ogen@@ icity with am@@ b@@ abo@@ o in mice and rats occurred with male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular Aden@@ ome with dos@@ ages to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of the exposure to a daily dose of 1200 mg Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r .
the under@@ lying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ zel@@ ular aden@@ oma and car@@ c@@ ome has not been resolved and the relevance of this observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
however , from the present survey data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic application , however , little evidence for adop@@ ting a clinical relevance of these findings .

studies of toxic@@ ity at young , which were treated at a age of 4 days , showed both in the control and also with am@@ b@@ abo@@ o @-@ treated animals a high mortality .
these results indicate that in the cases the metabolism of the metabolism are not fully mature , so that Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
A@@ gener@@ a solution to use is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for treating HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ anter@@ ior adult and children over 4 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the use of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ a solution to insert was not included in the case of PI @-@ treated patients &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r as a solution to insert is 14 % lower than in Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ generic capsules and solution to intake a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram is not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should be checked as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with taking the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a solution amounts to 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ b@@ abo@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to a daily basis of 2800 mg of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , there is no dose recommended for simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ a solution to insert and low do@@ gmati@@ zed k@@ nights , this combination may be avoided for these patient groups .
although a dose custom@@ ization for Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r is not necessary for use , an application of A@@ gener@@ a solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene glyco@@ l content , A@@ gener@@ a solution is contra@@ indicated in infants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , liver function or liver failure and patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration can cause the metabolism of the metabol@@ isation of this drug and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ( z ) .
the patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ a or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that it continues to develop opport@@ un@@ istic infection or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including the A@@ gener@@ a , does not prevent the risk of 47 of the transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that may cause serious or threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International standardi@@ zation R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the concentration of drugs .
A@@ gener@@ a should be removed for duration if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated metabolic disorders .
in h@@ amm@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ mine eyel@@ ids , reports on an increase of bleeding including spontaneous co@@ aches ha@@ em@@ ans and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sis .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and result in resistance development .
508 % increased , for C@@ max at 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous ing@@ rations with A@@ gener@@ a can also increase their plas@@ mak@@ on@@ ations in connection with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection to the side effects including hyp@@ oten@@ sion , bl@@ ur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on the data of 54 different CY@@ P3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am was significantly higher , according to oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk of people is not known as A@@ generic solution for inser@@ ting may not be used during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us ( see section 4.3 ) .
in the milk lac@@ tic rats , Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r related substances were not known , however , it is not known whether Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r on human breast milk is over .
a reproductive study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the income in the u@@ terus at the end of the stagn@@ ation of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 55 body weight during im@@ perfection .
the in@@ ability of A@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether they are related to the treatment of A@@ gener@@ a or another at the same time for HIV treatment , or if they are a consequence of the disease disease .

the applic@@ ability and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the treatment of alkal@@ ine is Al@@ dar@@ a for up to a maximum of 16 weeks . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , it is during one or two weeks cycles , with four weeks break between the treatment cycles , three times a week .
the cream is fer@@ til@@ ted in front of bed@@ ri@@ ms to the affected skin surfaces , so that it remains enough for a long time ( about eight hours ) before it is washed before it is washed .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was tested with a placebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four major studies at 9@@ 23 patients with War@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients treated with complete re@@ allocation of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined at 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks or placebo either daily or five times a week .
main indicators for efficacy was the number of patients with complete re@@ healing of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two trials in a total of 50@@ 5 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • At the treatment of War@@ ts in Gen@@ ital@@ ics , patients were treated with placebo @-@ treated patients , but only 3 % to 18 % of patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a treated patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .

the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is so long to continue until all the visible f@@ eig@@ ns disappeared in the genital or periods of periods , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks a treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the above @-@ described treatment processes should be observed when intensive local inflammation may occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if there is an infection in the treatment area .
if during follow @-@ up investigation 4 @-@ 8 weeks after the second treatment period the les@@ ions could only be completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should carry out the cream as soon as he noticed it , and continue to continue with the usual therapy plan .
in a thin layer , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is put into a thin layer and shut down into the ger@@ ms , with f@@ eig@@ ning infected skin area until the cream is completely moved .
it should occur in these patients between the benefit of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should occur in these patients between the benefit of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and with a possible organ loss or Gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host@@ - reaction .
in other studies where no daily pre@@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was conducted , two cases of heavier Phi@@ mo@@ sis were observed and a case with one of the circumcision &apos;s leading sn@@ ap .
in an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in higher than the recommended doses , an increased risk of heavy local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation were observed that treatment required and / or resulted in a temporary physical imp@@ air@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the outcome of the ure@@ th@@ ra , some women had difficulties with water , which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream immediately following a treatment with other co@@ aches in the treatment of external lig@@ ations in the Gen@@ ital@@ - and Peri@@ gee area , there are no clinical experiences yet .
limited data indicate an increased rate of incl@@ ination compared to HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown in this group of patients in relation to the elimination of clim@@ atic techniques .
the treatment of the bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips or the hair rate was not examined .
local search actions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions take in general during therapy or the reactions form after completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ creme .
if necessary due to the patient &apos;s complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of the local skin reaction , a treatment break can be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of therapy can be evaluated after the treatment of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the treatment of treatment .
since there is no data available on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable treatments should be taken into consideration in super@@ fi@@ xation bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs there are no clinical experiences , therefore the use of pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors are not recommended .
data from an open clinical study indicates that at large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is less likely probability of the response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears or on the lip@@ stick within the lip@@ r@@ ots .
only very limited data on the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osen in anatom@@ ic places outside the face and the scal@@ p .
the available data regarding the acute ker@@ at@@ pants in the low @-@ arms and hands support the effectiveness in this application . therefore , such application is not recommended .
local skin reaction occur frequently , but these reactions usually take away from the therapy to intensity or go back to the removal of the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
if local skin reaction may cause large dis@@ comfort or very strong , treatment can be exposed for a few days .
the data from an open clinical trial emerg@@ es that patients with more than 8 acqu@@ iring les@@ ions are found less than 8 patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune stimul@@ ating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ o@@ i@@ od@@ ine should be applied for patients who received an immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
from animal studies there are no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / f@@ amp@@ ale development , development or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although neither after one time nor after several exceptional use of quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) , no recommendation can be given during the breast@@ feeding period .
the most frequently shared and probably , or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in relation to adverse events in the studies of three times a week were local reactions on the place of treatment of feeding ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine treated patients ) .
the most frequently reported and probably reported using the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in the context of adverse events include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 22.@@ 8.1 % .
the Bas@@ ali@@ om patients treated from 185 to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ creme treated with a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III side effects are shown below .
the most common , probably , or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in the context of the side effect were a reaction at the application site ( 22 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients ) .
the adverse events that were specified by 252 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ creme treated patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis are listed below .
this investig@@ ational assessment of clinical signs shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream frequently showed a common skin reaction including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ hor@@ ori@@ ation / qu@@ itting ( 23 % ) and o@@ dem ( see section 4.4 ) .
this according to the investig@@ ational assessment of clinical signs indicate that in these studies with five times a week with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream very common to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sion ( 13 % ) , and heavy anxiety and bon@@ ding ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials investig@@ ating the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis Alo@@ pe@@ zie was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment location or in the surrounding area .
the vers@@ atility of unique oral intake of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which is equivalent to the contents of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vomiting , headache , my@@ el@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically severe side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ onia that norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous liquid norm@@ alization .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study the systemic concentrations of the alpha interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 single @-@ relevant phase 3 efficacy studies , the efficacy in relation to a full release of the foot war@@ ts in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment is clearly superior to placebo for 16 weeks .
in 60 % of total 119 patients with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , patients had incur@@ red completely ; this was only 20 % of the 105 patients treated with placebo treated patients ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete release could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated with male patients compared to 5 % of 161 patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine at five times of application per week over 6 weeks has been studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed , individual primary super@@ fi@@ xation bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data from an open , un@@ controlled long term study after four years of present data indicate that about 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically healed and that remained for 48 months .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine in one or two treatment times in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , untreated clinical trials was investigated in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , not hyper@@ trop@@ at@@ otic , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic pro@@ - les@@ ions within a related 25 c@@ m2 large treatment area than on the hair@@ y scal@@ p or in the face .
the annual data from two combined monitoring studies show a recur@@ rent rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical outcome .
the approved indications ex@@ propri@@ ations , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ pants and super@@ sti@@ tial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma are usually not focused on pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and therefore were not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was studied in four randomised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 years with m@@ oll@@ us@@ cum cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 313 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks / w ) .
a minimum system of 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ creme fra@@ yed by the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ pants was observed during the three times a week in 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and tot@@ alled 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and in the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ day period was approximately 10@@ times higher than the 2@@ hours half @-@ value after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; this refers to an extended re@@ ten@@ tion of the medicine in the skin .
data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years was low and comparable to patients with healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ osis or super @-@ specific bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rat no . doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg resulted in significantly reduced weight of weight and increased milk weight ; a study showed no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice during painting had no tum@@ ors in three days a week .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od possesses only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and not mut@@ agen@@ ic , is a risk for people due to systematic exposure than very low .
the tum@@ ours occurred in the group of mice that was treated with the real @-@ free cream , previously and in greater number than in the control group with low U@@ VR .
it may harm other people , even if these same symptoms have significantly imp@@ airs necessary or you may notice adverse reactions that are not listed in this manual information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists .
● F@@ ill @-@ war@@ ts ( Cond@@ yl@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) , formed on the skin in the area of gen@@ itali@@ a ( genital organs ) and the An@@ us ( after ) , a common bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma That is a frequently growing , slow growing form of skin cancer with very low lik@@ el@@ ihood of the spread to other parts of the body .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for patients with sigh@@ ted diagnosis of a Mu@@ eng@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ot@@ ine I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neurological symptoms of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves in connection ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cer@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ kan@@ e , g@@ ag ) are not disman@@ tled , resulting in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non @-@ neurological symptoms of M@@ PS I can appear : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , the movements make difficult , dimin@@ ished lung volume , heart and eye diseases .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be supervised by a physician , which has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edit@@ ary metabolic diseases .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be performed in a hospital or hospital with re@@ vit@@ ational instruments , and patients may need to prevent any prescription drugs in order to prevent an allergic reaction .

in the study , however , the safety of the drug was investigated , however , its efficacy was measured by reducing its effect in terms of reducing the concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver .
in children under five years Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me sen@@ ate the concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , skin rash , arter@@ ial pain ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the lim@@ bs ( in hands and feet ) , heat @-@ feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion site .
very common side effects in patients below five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ at ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be inv@@ alid ( allergic ) on lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) , not to be applied .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will commen@@ ce every year all new information which may be announced , and to update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms will receive patients who observe al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms regarding the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission acquired Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for placing al@@ loc@@ y@@ ms in the entire European Union .
Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ istan and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology under the use of CH@@ O @-@ mammals ( Chinese ham@@ ster ov@@ ary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indic@@ ative of long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with sigh@@ ted diagnosis of a Mu@@ eng@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ot@@ ine I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ istan deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neurological manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be performed by a physician , which has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edit@@ ary metabolic diseases .
the initial inclusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient is wearing it , all 15 minutes in single steps can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme is recommended .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure was not identified , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme is recommended .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients can develop in@@ fusion reactions that are defined as any other side effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should only be made available in an appropriate clinical environment , where re@@ vit@@ alising installations are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected to form nearly all patients Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase , usually within 3 months of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution by using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
as little experience regarding the recovery after a longer break @-@ in , it must be cau@@ tious because of the theore@@ tically increased risk reaction after a dis@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the in@@ fusion of medication ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ py@@ mis@@ ka ) to minim@@ ize the potential occurr@@ ence of in@@ fusion reactions .
in case of a mild or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be avoided and / or reduction of the incidence rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , in@@ fusion must be stopped , until the symptoms are brought to decrease , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is considered .
the in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction of the incidence rate of 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , which occurred to the previous reaction .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ quin or proc@@ ain because a potential risk of inter@@ ference with intra@@ cellular absorption of lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase exists .
animal experimental studies do not release direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exp@@ on@@ ally exposed to lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase on breast milk , is recommended , while treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is not to be silent .
the adverse events in clinical trials were con@@ stituted mainly as in@@ fusion reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study . participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) were observed .
un@@ wanted medicines in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , which were observed during the phase 3 trial and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respiratory trac@@ ts and lungs in history occurred severe reactions , including bron@@ chi@@ ds , respiratory and facial expression ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted medicines in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , which during a phase 2 study , with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predominantly heavy compar@@ ing form and treatment duration of up to 12 months , were reported in the table .
100 e / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 e / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients , it occurred within 3 months after the onset of treatment to a server version , with a severe failure rate in the age of 5 patients ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older ) .
by the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature departure from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were detected by Radio@@ immun@@ op@@ aus@@ ation ( R@@ IP ) Ass@@ ay before , including 3 patients who never came to ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with reduced to low antibodies had a robust reduction in the G@@ ag sp@@ amm@@ els in the Har@@ n while in patients with high antibodies could determine a variable number of G@@ ag in the Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal fluid to low neutral @-@ neutral effect on the enzy@@ matic Lar@@ oni@@ das@@ e- activity in vitro , which seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of g@@ ag in the Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies did not appear in connection with the incidence of undes@@ i@@ rable drug reactions , even if the occurr@@ ence of undes@@ i@@ red pharmac@@ ological re@@ actions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the jus@@ tification for the enzyme therapy is in one for hydro@@ ly@@ sis of accumulated sub@@ str@@ ates and preventing a further accumulation of sufficient restoration of enzymes .
according to intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and administered by cells into lymp@@ ho@@ os@@ omes , the most prob@@ able of Mann@@ i @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recruited for the study , the total disease spectrum was found , the majority of patients from the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient had the serious phen@@ otype .
patients were recruited if they had an increased exp@@ iratory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were then recruited for an open @-@ label extensions study , where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 e / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients from the placebo group to improve the lung function and the hearing that is shown in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as shown in the following table .
the decrease of expected pro@@ cent@@ u@@ al FE@@ V is clin@@ ically significant over this period of clin@@ ically and the absolute lung volumes increased significantly proportional to the height of growing children .
of 26 patients with h@@ ep@@ atic reactions before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks , a clear waste of the G@@ ag @-@ mirror in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ inine ) was found until the study remained constant .
concerning the het@@ ero@@ gene@@ ous diseases between the patients that has been taken into account the clin@@ ically significant changes for five efficacy variable ( at the expect@@ ant normal FE@@ V , range in 6 @-@ minutes @-@ test , range of movement of the shoulder @-@ edge AH@@ I and visual acu@@ ity ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 22 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a year @-@ old open Phase 2 study was conducted , mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients who were examined at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with heavy so@@ iling form and 4 with the middle course form ) .
at four patients , the dosage due to increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror in the Har@@ n had increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients a mag@@ nit@@ ude ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined according to the Z @-@ Score for this age group , whereas the younger patients with the middle compar@@ ing form had a normal spiritual development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe failure , only limited or not progress in cog@@ nitive development were observed .
in a phase 4 study , investigations into pharmac@@ ologically dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dos@@ ing schemes were performed on the G@@ ag @-@ Spiegel in Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 e / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 e / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dos@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks may result in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , a representation alternative ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dos@@ ing schem@@ ata is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will provide any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug may be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 was similar to patients suffering from older and less affected patients .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with Cis@@ pl@@ atin ( other medicines for cancer ) when the cancer is not re@@ se@@ eable ( drug may not be removed ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - the cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) or possibly spreads easily on other parts of the body . • for advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small cell lung cancer , which does not attack the epi@@ theli@@ al cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used for patients who have previously been treated earlier , in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who had previously obtained other chem@@ o@@ therapies , as all therapy are applied .
to decrease side effects , patients should receive cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( vitamin ) and vitamin B12 in the treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered along with Cis@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of Cis@@ pl@@ atin additionally a &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic drug &quot; ( medicines for vomiting ) and liquids ( to prevent a liquid deficiency ) .
in patients whose blood image changes or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be put up , removed or reduces the dose .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed slow@@ ed down , the formation of the DNA and RNA and prevents that the cells divide .
the conversion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in its active form is easier of@@ equi@@ val@@ ed in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations in the active form of the medicine and a longer effect in canc@@ er@@ ous cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta was studied for the treatment of malign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oms in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease were previously treated with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( other medicines for cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin , survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared with 9.3 months on the sole administration of Cis@@ pl@@ atin .
patients who had previously received chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients who did not attack the epi@@ theli@@ al cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta was longer than with the compar@@ ative medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted Eli Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. for placing A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each stroke bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chloride ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - sis is taken from the water tank and dil@@ uted with 0,9 % sodium chloride @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin shown to first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is shown for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ cell carcin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion about a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day course cycle .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion about a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completing P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day course cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion about a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reaction must be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift as well as the day after the treatment a Kor@@ ti@@ ko@@ ster@@ oid .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued during the whole treatment period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate dose .
patients also have an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week prior to the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed @-@ dose as well as after each third stop cycle .
in patients receiving p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , each gift should be a complete blood image , including a differentiation of the leuk@@ ocy@@ tes and a Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te counting .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should amount to &lt; 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose @-@ examination will take place in the day of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the predic@@ tive therapy cycles .
following the recovery , the patients must be treated according to the notes in tables 1 , 2 and 3 which are treated for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 blood flow .
if patients should develop non @-@ ugly toxic@@ ity tox@@ icity 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA , until the patient is before treatment
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be broken off when in patients after 2 dos@@ ing products , hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity . 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical trials showed no indication that in the age of 65 years or more in comparison to patients aged 65 years , an increase in the age of 65 is an increase .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to non @-@ sufficient data for uncertainty and effectiveness .
in clinical trials , patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance were required of ≥ 45 ml / min . for all patients recommended dose adap@@ tations .
the data situation in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however patients with a liver function limitation of &gt; to the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - border value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the upper limit of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ fold the upper limit value ( for presence of liver metast@@ asis ) is not particularly investigated in the studies .
patients must be monitored in terms of the bone mar@@ ker and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be administered to patients before their total neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ar@@ sis was once again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ tot@@ ality of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose @-@ reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of the absolute neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ation , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ tion and maximum non @-@ ugly toxic@@ ity , such as they have observed in the previous treatment cycles . ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ th@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity , such as neut@@ rop@@ enia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ enia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ enia was observed , if a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 has taken place .
therefore , all patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients have to be instructed to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 as a proph@@ yl@@ tic measure to reduce toxic tox@@ icity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) have to avoid simultaneous intake of non @-@ cy@@ c@@ log@@ istic ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) for at least 2 days prior to therapy , treatment and mind@@ ful of 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients who are scheduled for treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is required to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients who occurred these events had relevant risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including dehy@@ d@@ ration , existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation , in trans@@ duc@@ al space , a drainage of the eff@@ usion of the p@@ em@@ bo@@ xed treatment can be avoided .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events have been reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , when this drug was commonly administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine is not recommended ( except yellow fever , this vaccination is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible shepherd of reproductive ability exists by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out prior to treatment - G@@ inn to take advice regarding the sperm count .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ log@@ istic ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) to a reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the consequence of an increasingly occurr@@ ence of side effects .
therefore , caution is provided when patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be applied in high dosage .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , therapy and mind@@ ful of 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.4 ) .
as no data regarding the inter@@ fere with N@@ SA@@ IDs are required for a long half @-@ time frame such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for at least 5 days before therapy , must be avoided with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - mixed at least 2 days before therapy .
the major in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the eye status during the disease and the possibility of interaction between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ence and ant@@ ine@@ op@@ l@@ astic chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat patients with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ence .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed during pregnancy , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ timet@@ abol@@ ites are expected during an application in pregnancy heavy birth defects .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be used during pregnancy unless necessary , demanding and after careful handling of the user for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage of reproductive ability exists by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out prior to the treatment of treatment , consult with regard to the sper@@ mac@@ on ser@@ vi@@ ans .

following the gift of an mal@@ mal@@ dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a limited number of healthy volunteers , who simultaneously received or@@ list@@ at , observed a minor decrease of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma cent@@ ration .
zo@@ experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are primarily gastro@@ intestinal nature and depend on pharmac@@ ological effects of the medicine , because absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal effects were determined in clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg via a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the skins are defined as follows : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not inv@@ al@@ u@@ able ) .
the frequency of the familiar side effects that were found after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unlimited size .

single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were given over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects , without having significant clinical findings .
in the majority of the cases reported by or@@ list@@ at @-@ over@@ do@@ zation , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on research on humans and animal can be assumed from a rapid recovery , systematic effects that attributed to the li@@ ve@@ inhibit@@ ing properties from or@@ list@@ at .

clinical trials was derived from clinical studies that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at was taken three times daily , the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food was blocked .
two double @-@ blind , randomised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 indicates the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ic , fet@@ ched diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ani@@ zation ) , has been rated as follows : as alter@@ ation of the body weight in study ( Table 1 ) , and as part of the participants who have lost more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the biggest weight loss in the first 6 months came up .
average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mol / l ) and placebo + 2,8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mol / l ) .

this means that the drug prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies which are strong or moderate trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting .
at chem@@ o@@ therapies that are strong trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting , 59 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi chemotherapy alone ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ fed offset patients ( 126 of 221 ) .
at chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting , 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 153 % of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ fed offset patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted L@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . , a permit for the import of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .

the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induced by a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids before chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on display , patients should be supervised by am@@ nesty law or signs of a sub@@ acute ret@@ ali@@ ation after injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , caution is provided with the same gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that leng@@ th@@ ens the Q@@ T @-@ interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or which tend to an extension .
except in connection with a further chemotherapy gift , Alo@@ xi should neither be used for prevention of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy .
in pre @-@ clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron inhibit@@ ing the activity of the five examined chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics ( Cis@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ ine , dos@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis was shown that the simultaneous line of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , T@@ ini@@ din , R@@ ani@@ ti@@ dine , T@@ ani@@ ti@@ dine , T@@ ani@@ ti@@ dine , T@@ ani@@ ti@@ dine , T@@ ani@@ ti@@ dine , T@@ ani@@ ti@@ dine , T@@ ani@@ ti@@ dine , T@@ ani@@ ti@@ dine , T@@ ani@@ ti@@ dine , T@@ ani@@ ti@@ dine , T@@ ani@@ ti@@ dine , T@@ ani@@ ti@@ dine , T@@ ani@@ ti@@ dine , T@@ ani@@ ti@@ dine , T@@ ani@@ ti@@ dine , T@@ ani@@ ti@@ dine , T@@ ani@@ ti@@ dine , T@@ ani@@ ti@@ dine , T@@ ani@@ ti@@ dine , T@@ ani@@ ti@@ dine , T@@ ani@@ ti@@ dine , T@@ ani@@ ti@@ dine , and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) .
experiences on the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies lie not before , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied during pregnancy , unless it is necessary to be treated by the doctor &apos;s doctor .
in clinical trials , the most common adverse events in clinical trials were observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which , at least , possibly with alo@@ xi in the context , headache ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity and reactions on the appointment ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dose , similar levels of adverse events showed similar levels of adverse events , as in the other dos@@ ages ; there were no dose @-@ mode relationships .
there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis probably does not have effective treatment in a alo@@ xi@@ ation of alo@@ o .
in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , 1.@@ 132 patients receiving a moderately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) , which was given to Day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously .
in a randomised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ Cis@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ azine and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , with patients who received 32 mg of on@@ fed offset which were given to day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of studies with moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the clinical trial with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vomiting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the corresponding effects of on@@ wheel and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation .
the aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of i.@@ v. named Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0,@@ 25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration follows an initial elimination of plasma cent@@ rations , a slow elimination of elimination from the body with an average annual half @-@ time of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma percentage ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally propor@@ tionally in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 m g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
according to intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 cans , the mean postoperative ( ± SD ) increase was measured at 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
out of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic sim@@ ulations , that measured at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days , total ex@@ position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) reached a value of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ max was higher after the intake of 0.@@ 75 mg higher .
about 40 % of the kidneys are eliminated , and about another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which have compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies for metabol@@ isation have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
Eli@@ min@@ ation After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered drug made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a single intraven@@ ous bolt injection was 173 ± 73 ml / min and total clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver function are the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ um@@ - and the average systemic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , however , a reduction of dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical trials , only after ex@@ positions observed , which are considered enough of the maximum human exposure exposure , which indicates a small relevance to clinical use .
10 From pre @-@ clinical trials found indications that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block at very high concentrations of ion channels that are involved in the vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( every dose was given in about 30 times the therapeutic exposure of humans ) that were given daily for over two years , resulted in an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine ( pancre@@ as , pancre@@ as and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not in mice .
the under@@ lying mechanisms are not fully @-@ known , but because of the used high doses and because Alo@@ xi is determined for a unique application , the relevance of these results are low .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative ass@@ essments in which the auth@@ orization of approval for the placing of hepatitis C proposed by Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution was recommended .
this means that Alph@@ eon should res@@ emble a biological medicine called R@@ of@@ er@@ one @-@ A with the same veter@@ an effective ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called the reference supplement &quot; ) .
Alph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ persistent ) hepatitis C ( a virus infection in liver disease ) .
in a micro@@ scope investigation indicates the liver tissue damage , and the values of the liver enzyme Al@@ an@@ in Amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which is stimul@@ ated to the formation of the active ingredient .
the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon used data to prove the compar@@ ision of Alph@@ eon with R@@ of@@ eron @-@ A ( drug structure , composition , and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Alph@@ eon was compared with the effectiveness of reference incl@@ ine to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment of treatment on the drug ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © EMEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or Distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non business . what were the greatest concerns caused by CH@@ MP to protect the approval ?
furthermore , concerns expressed concern that the data for the stability of the substance and the drug @-@ market drug may not be sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C based on the treatment with Alph@@ eon and R@@ of@@ eron @-@ A were similar in the clinical study .
after adju@@ sting the treatment with Alph@@ eon , the disease is ret@@ ard@@ ant again in more patients than with the reference agent ; moreover , Alph@@ eon had more side effects .
aside from this , the drug was introduced in the study to investigate the question of how the body forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , is not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be applied to the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with cruci@@ sten@@ formation ) and small infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ - or chi@@ pping ) , short@@ age and paraly@@ sis wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections , which have been proven to be proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ cocc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not work against this kind of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied to patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age the skin surface is not allowed to be treated more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not speak to treatment two or three days , the physician should investigate the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of bacterial cells , in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies in the proportion of patients whose infection was diver@@ ging after the end of treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients with placebo spoke to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected dogs , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together , about 90 % of the patients were enrolled in the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go had been involved in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ ure ( eit@@ er@@ ge@@ ared h@@ ells in body tissues ) or of infections , which have been proven or probably caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation of the contrac@@ tor .
the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ ers ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in short @-@ term treatment of the following superf@@ icial skin infections prevail against the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , infected small in@@ fir@@ s , par@@ atro@@ cities , or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for placing al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
patients who have no improvement within two to three days are supposed to be investigated again and an alternative therapy can be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the case of a sensi@@ tis@@ ation or heavy local irrit@@ ation by the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment is broken off , the o@@ int@@ ment must be eff@@ ected and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection is started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as path@@ ogens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies with secondary infected wounds the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by meth@@ ic@@ illin @-@ resistant stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ cocc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) were in@@ sufficient .
an alternative therapy is expected to be considered , if after a 2 @-@ 3 day treatment there is no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected place .
the impact of the simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plas@@ mak@@ ef@@ ulness , which have been reached with people according to top@@ ical application on damaged skin , or infected superf@@ icial wounds , a clinical relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 after the oral gift of 2 times a day , 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the middle ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment on a weak@@ ened skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , Dos@@ is@@ custom@@ iz@@ ations are not required for any systemic treatment with CY@@ P3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproduction according to oral pill and are inadequate in terms of implic@@ ations for the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should be used during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ic@@ ulin of the gift of systemic antibiotic .
if the breast@@ feeding is resum@@ ed / finished or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continued / ended , it should be between the benefit of the breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and to the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for women .
in clinical trials about 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections who have applied Al@@ tar@@ go , the most commonly reported side effect on the appointment was about 1 % of the patients concerned .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic derivatives of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ opil@@ us pass@@ ag@@ erial ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ ag@@ erial ) .
the re@@ action of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding capacity of the 50s of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes , which differs from the bind@@ ings of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the binding station ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 is involved in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P binding centre and the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ring centre .
by binding on this binding station , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bited pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ ing , blocked partial P @-@ binding inter@@ actions and stop the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
due to the local prevalence of resistance , the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin appear in at least some of infection forms , an advice should be stre@@ aked by experts .
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin versus S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ illin .
in case of failure to treat S.@@ au@@ re@@ us the presence of tribes should be considered with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) .
Res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was carried out daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and hal@@ ved skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days to the top@@ ical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , single plasma samples were gained .
the sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients each before Medi@@ ation and children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic inclusion on people after top@@ ical application of 1 % sal@@ be on 200 c@@ m2 were deported to 200 c@@ m2 . AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhibit@@ ing .
metabol@@ ism in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ en was primarily medi@@ ated by CY@@ P2@@ A4 , under low participation of CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies of oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in @-@ vitro review on gene mutation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and in rats @-@ micro@@ core test for in @-@ vi@@ vo study chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats signs of restricted fer@@ til@@ ity in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which reaches up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure of the human ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 ) .
at oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 @-@ fold of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) , development of development ( reduced body weight of fet@@ us and delayed exposure ) and maternal mortality .
the holder of approval for the placing has to ensure that a pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system , as shown in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application form ( version 6.2 ) is present and works before the product is marketed as long as the marketing product is applied .
the holder of the approval program comm@@ its to implement detailed detailed studies and additional pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance procedures , as described in version 1 of Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) as well as all the additional updates of the R@@ MP certification , which are agreed with the CH@@ MP .
as described in the CH@@ MP &quot; Gui@@ del@@ ine on Risk Management System for Human Resources , &quot; the updated R@@ MP will be submitted simultaneously with the next peri@@ odic safety update Report .

ambient rix is used for protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children between one and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases .
ambient rix is applied within one of two doses of the vaccine , a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix must only be used if during immun@@ isation a low risk of hepatitis B infection is ensured and ensured that the vaccine is made up of two doses .
if a refresh@@ ment dose is requested against hepatitis A or B , ambient rix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine will be given .
vaccines work by preventing the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , &quot; as it can resist a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies .
ambient rix contains the same components such as the vaccine Twin@@ rix adults , and has been approved by the vaccine since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ inations are applied to the protection against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix are administered as part of an existing vaccination plan .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data used to support the application of Twin@@ rix adult , also used as proof for the use of Ambi@@ rix .
the main inde@@ er for the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the final injection of a protective antibody .
in an additional study involving 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two injec@@ tions .
ambient rix resulted in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children one month after the final injection on the development of anti @-@ antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that ambient &apos;s degree of Ambi@@ rix at a 6 @-@ month distance between the injec@@ tions was similar .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed at more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection station , redness , Mat@@ sion ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability .
ambient rix must not be inv@@ alid ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
August 2002 announced the European Commission to G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ y@@ s.@@ a. a permit for the placing of Ambi@@ rix in the entire
the standardi@@ zation plan for the basic di@@ mming with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vaccine doses , whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a gap of hepatitis A is requested for hepatitis B and hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vaccines or with a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis C surface ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies are in the same size as according to the vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ous vaccines .
it is not fully secured , whether immune competent individuals who have referred to a hepatitis C in@@ oc@@ ulation , have a refresh@@ ment of protection as protection , as they may also be protected by the immun@@ ological memory .
3 As with all injection systems , in the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction to the gift of the vaccine it should be immediately available for medical treatment and monitoring .
if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation vaccine is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in hem@@ i@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies could be achieved in these cases , so in these cases the gift of further vaccination can be required .
as an intra@@ ocular injection or intra@@ muscular administration may result in a sub@@ optimal imp@@ etus , this injection system should be avoided .
however , at Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or blood cl@@ ots , ambient rix can be inj@@ ected as an exception of sub@@ cut@@ aneously in these cases , after intra@@ muscular administration .
if ambient rix was administered at the same time with a combin@@ ant Di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ us@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza type b vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
patients with immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ sive therapy or patients with immun@@ defects have to be assumed that possibly no sufficient immune response is achieved .
in a clinical study which was carried out with 3 vaccine doses of this formulation , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , Mat@@ ern@@ ity , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache , and fever comparable to the frequency which was observed in the earlier Thi@@ omer@@ ang and preser@@ vative @-@ containing vaccine production .
in clinical trials , at a total of 10@@ 27 vaccine doses have been administered at a total of 10@@ 27 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 and including 15 years the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ t@@ bsp combination vaccine .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ urities on a calculation basis per vaccination dose . Ambi@@ rix , but not based on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.4 % of the test subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % in the subjects following the gift of dose of 3 @-@ cans combined vaccine .
according to the complete vaccination cycle reported 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects who had received Ambi@@ rix more than pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects who have been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of Matcha was comparable ( i.e. about the entire vaccination cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of the subjects who got Ambi@@ rix , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % of the subjects who received 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine ) .
the incidence of distinctive pain and hum@@ ility was low and comparable to that was observed after administration of the combined vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses vaccine .
in a compar@@ ative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ inations , the occurr@@ ence of local reactions and general actions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ gruppe was comparable to that with the 3 @-@ dos@@ ing combination of hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was observed .
however , in the 6- to 11@@ - year @-@ old , however , following vaccination with Ambi@@ rix a Frequ@@ ent occurr@@ ence of pain ( at the injection station ) per dose , was reported .
the proportion of vaccines that reported on severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccination schem@@ as with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ ISA@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen reported was statistically not different .
in clinical trials , which were performed in vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years , the serum @-@ conversion rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % were a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 per@@ verse dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the ser@@ pent@@ ine rates for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 per@@ verse dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study that was performed in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two doses Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combined vaccine with three doses .
with 289 persons whose immun@@ o@@ gene@@ ity was ext@@ end@@ able , the serum samples ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher in the case against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 following the gift of 3 @-@ dose @-@ carbon@@ ic acid higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune response , which were achieved in a clinical compar@@ ative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old a month after the end of the full vaccine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vacc@@ inations were either a 2 @-@ doses vaccination with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vaccination with a combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface .
the per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies could be demonstrated at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine .
the immune response shown in this study was comparable to both anti@@ gens which was formed following vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated Hep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , the per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs @-@ antibodies could be comparable to immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccination in the 0 @-@ 12 months vaccine .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix was administered at the same time with the conception of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ us@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza type b vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study carried out with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults , demonstrated for the current formulation of similar nap@@ op@@ rot@@ ect@@ ants and ser@@ pent@@ ine rates as for earlier formulation .

hepatitis A virus is usually transferred via viral food@@ stuffs and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways such as bathing in water @-@ contam@@ inated waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vaccines , Ambi@@ rix cannot protect completely from an infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccination series was completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child before the administration of both vaccines have already been infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus ( though you / your child can &apos;t feel un@@ comfortable or sick for the vaccination point ) may not prevent in@@ oc@@ ulation a disease .
a protection against other infections which damage the liver or symptoms that are similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , can &apos;t be convey@@ ed .
• When your child has shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can arise through ju@@ cking skin strikes , breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • if you have occurred with your child once an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . if you / your child has an severe infection with fever .
• When you want to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and generally accepted by the second vaccination dose ) .
with a potential risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he will recommend you / your child 3 injec@@ tions of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of an effective proportion of hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface ( hepatitis B surface ) .
the second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of reduced content is commonly given a month after the first dose and may give you a vaccines at the end of the vaccination .
sometimes ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected with people who are inj@@ ected in severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not in muscle . if you / your child are weak@@ ened due to illness or treatment in your own immune defence / or if you / your child are under@@ lying / under@@ taking a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis .
ambient rix can be given in such cases , but the immune response of these people may not be sufficient , so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccination is .
21 S@@ ing your doctor if you / your child will receive further medicines ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without prescription ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated or imm@@ ort@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) , or has been planned in the near future .
however , it can be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both Hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given simultaneously with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate parts and as possible as possible as possible .
if ambient rix are given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be enough .
usually , ambi@@ rix will not be given pregnant or lact@@ ating women unless they are vacc@@ inated for hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible .
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 p@@ im@@ p cans ) : • pain or dis@@ comfort at enem@@ a or redness • Mat@@ ern@@ ity • headache • loss of appetite
♦ frequent ( up to 1 case per 10 p@@ im@@ p cans ) : • swelling at the injection unit • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • drow@@ sin@@ ess • gastro@@ intestinal complaints
other side effects , the days or weeks after the vaccination with compar@@ ative combination or individual ingredients against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 stored doses ) are :
these include local , limited or broad mar@@ vel that can be it@@ ching or la@@ undering @-@ shaped , swelling of the eyes and facial , frigh@@ tening at@@ olls or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure loss and loss of consciousness .
flu @-@ like symptoms , including ch@@ ills , muscle and joint pain sei@@ zu@@ res , dizziness , ab@@ norm@@ alities such as t@@ ing@@ ling and &quot; ants running , &quot; multiple sclerosis , disorders of optic nerve , loss of sensation or movement of physical bodies , strong head@@ aches , and rigi@@ dity of neck , inter@@ rup@@ ting normal brain functions

23 Inform@@ ate your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if one of the most listed side effects you / your child significantly imp@@ airs or you may notice adverse reactions that are not specified in this package use .
ambient rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packages to 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data , which have been announced since issu@@ ing the first approval for the placing on the market , the CH@@ MP said that the benefit ratio for ambi@@ rix is positive .
however , because Ambi@@ rix was placed only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug was limited due to the minor patient ex@@ position .
ammon@@ ium can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ sensitivity cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high am@@ moni@@ ac concentrations ) in pre @-@ history .
ammon@@ ium is divided - split by several single doses to meals - swallowed , among the food mixed or via a gastro@@ pod ( through the stomach in the stomach of leading hose ) or a nose sun ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) .
no compar@@ ative study was , since Am@@ mon@@ aps could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo ( a hypo@@ critical medicine , i.e. without active ingredient ) .
ammon@@ ium can also lead to loss of appetite , a abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , liqu@@ or disease , stomach pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , unpleasant body od@@ or or weight gain .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Am@@ mon@@ ary is effective in patients suffering from the u@@ rea cycle to high am@@ moni@@ ac values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ ary was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information about this drug . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use of all patients are inde@@ xed in all patients in which a complete enzyme has already manifest@@ ed in the new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days ) .
in patients with a late @-@ firm form ( in@@ complete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself according to the first life of life ) , an indication of the use of a hyper@@ text @-@ based en@@ cephal@@ opathy exists .
for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form .
the daily dose is individually controlled taking the protein toler@@ ance and the patient &apos;s growth and development of the patient &apos;s necessary protein intake .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body@@ weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with a body weight of over 20 kg and with adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ inine in a dose of 0.0@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer an early @-@ term deficiency .
patients with an Arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ ucc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must be obtained in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing illness , as a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , if the tablets are not immediately entering the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , equivalent to the maximum daily dose .
therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used to treat patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium re@@ ten@@ tion and ede@@ tion .
since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is carried out over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be applied to patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
at a sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ down of the ne@@ ural strength and to an increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed appeal of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thereby a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate is eliminated in humans in the breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least an adverse event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these undes@@ i@@ red events that they had not been linked to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a more likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old an@@ ore@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic disease , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ie , periph@@ eral neurop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of an excessive dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) in a 5 @-@ month old small child was one of them .
these symptoms proceed with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic , which showed a dos@@ is@@ tive neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity with a intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic is a metabolic link which is con@@ ju@@ gated by Ac@@ et@@ y@@ formulation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys .
antibodies seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine with u@@ rea comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients suffering from the u@@ rea cycle can be assumed that for each gram , sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can be produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is early and the treatment immediately started to improve survival opportunities and clinical outcome .
the forecast of the early symptoms of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in the new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ ar@@ ist , and the disease carried himself with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their sti@@ ck@@ proof an@@ alogy within the first life year of death .
due to hem@@ i@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen compounds ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic ) , proteins fell from post@@ oper@@ atively and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first life of life ) .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with the time for many to spiritual disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ term form of the disease ( including female patients with het@@ ero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bam@@ ber@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which re@@ plen@@ ished from a hyper@@ text @-@ induced en@@ cephal@@ opathy and then permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logic can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ lic , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidneys with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were detected following the gift of a single dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in an empty healthy adult and in patients suffering from liver cir@@ rho@@ sis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites became also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic .
after an oral supplement of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measur@@ able plasma cent@@ er@@ rations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were detected .
in the majority of patients suffering from u@@ rea cycle or ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) mean no phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate in plasma on the next morning .
in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis that were repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma concentration were five times higher than according to the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine over the kidneys .
after the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses treated no cl@@ ast@@ ogenic effects ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral dos@@ ing a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either by oral ( infants and children who can &apos;t swal@@ low any tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing illness ) or via a gast@@ ro stom@@ y or a no@@ stri@@ de .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with a body weight of over 20 kg and with adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , arg@@ inine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um@@ prot@@ eine in plasma should be held within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ inine in a dose of 0.0@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer an early @-@ term deficiency .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , equivalent to the maximum daily dose .
if rat kill before the birth phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic ( active met@@ abo@@ lit of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ) were exposed to les@@ ions in the py@@ rami@@ ds of the brain .
a more likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old an@@ ore@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic disease , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ie , periph@@ eral neurop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
antibodies seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine with u@@ rea comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess weight .
on the basis of research on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the u@@ rea cycle can be assumed that for each gram , sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate can be produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine nitrogen .
existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logic can occur .
according to an oral supplement of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form 15 minutes after taking measur@@ able plasma cent@@ er@@ rations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were detected .
during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product only for a period of 3 months at a temperature of over 25 ° C .
for this purpose , the small measuring sco@@ op 0.@@ 95 g , the middle measuring sco@@ op 2.9 g and the large measuring sco@@ op 8.6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient must maintain the medicine above a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can be dissolved in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot leave the sti@@ ck@@ led waste products that accum@@ ulate in the consumption of proteins in the body .
in case of your laboratory studies , you must notify the doctor that you are using AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can influence the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other drugs , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if you take other medicines or have recently taken care of prescription drugs .
during the breast@@ feeding you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because the medicine could go over into breast milk and could damage your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , headache , taste distur@@ ban@@ ces , desc@@ endant of hearing , orient@@ ori@@ ety , memory defic@@ its , and a deteri@@ oration of existing neurological conditions were observed .
if you notice one of these symptoms , please contact your doctor or your doctor &apos;s emergency entry to the introduction of a corresponding treatment .
if you have forgotten the taking of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the respective dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in blood image ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ at@@ ocy@@ tes ) , lower appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , un@@ comfortable skin breath , skin rash , kidney dys@@ functions , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if one of the listed side effects are significantly affected or you may notice adverse reactions that are not listed in this manual information .
you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS according to the box and the vessel to &quot; be used without the given exp@@ iry date .
as AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS looks and contents of the package AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish colour and oval shape , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot;
30 If in your laboratory studies , you must notify the physician to inform you AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can influence the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other drugs , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if you take other medicines or have recently taken care of prescription drugs .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS on equal doses or via a gast@@ ric ho@@ ist@@ le ( hose , which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nose sun ( hose , which is managed by the nose into the stomach ) .

An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute Cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , decreased blood supply to the heart ) , for example in un@@ stable Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; St@@ up@@ lift &quot; ( an abnormal measurement value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is applied to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients that can under@@ go a PCI , a higher dose is administered , and in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS of ACS , with the effect of angi@@ ox at all sole gift or in conjunction with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination of treatment with h@@ ep@@ arin ( another anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube , which remains in the arter@@ ie to prevent a cl@@ asp ) , and they also received other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and asp@@ ir@@ in .
for the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without any gift of GP@@ I - with the preventing of new events ( deaths , heart attacks , or revisions ) after 30 days or a year altogether as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who under@@ go a PCI was An@@ gi@@ ox in relation to all indicators as effective as Hep@@ arin , except for heavy bleeding , with which it was significantly more effective than h@@ ep@@ arin .
angi@@ ox may not be applied to patients who may be inv@@ alid ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other Hir@@ ud@@ ine or any of the other ingredients .
it must not be used in patients who had recently had a blood pressure , as well as people with severe hypertension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for h@@ ep@@ arin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission announced the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . a permit for placing an@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( un@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST mid@@ market inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) , when an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg , followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is carried out in another sequence , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention will be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI in clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 @-@ 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg can be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI is from an initial intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and one of them immediately followed by intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and efficacy of a sole Bol@@ us Gift of An@@ gi@@ ox was not studied and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value is shortened ( ACT after 5 minutes ) to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0,3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should be made .
in order to reduce the occurr@@ ence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ tion@@ ated and dil@@ uted medicines should be carefully mixed before the application and should be administered quickly intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1,@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is given correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function limitation ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which can be subjected to a PCI ( whether using a bi@@ valent case against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value is less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg is sufficient to re @-@ check the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose .

patients are carefully insp@@ ected during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if in the PCI @-@ patient , most bleeding in the arter@@ ial position occur in most cases , patients who under@@ go per@@ cut@@ aneous corpor@@ al intervention ( PCI ) , may occur during the treatment in principle anywhere .
in patients who are taking war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International standardi@@ zation R@@ atio ) should be drawn into consideration to ensure that the value of treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in should be achieved before the treatment existing .
depar@@ ting from the knowledge about the action mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( h@@ ep@@ arin , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators ) may be assumed that these active ingredients increase blood risk .
in the combination of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants are the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ atic parameters in any case regularly .

both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in Group as well as in the compar@@ ative groups of women and patients with over 65 years in patients were more likely to be adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding were defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for heavy bleeding , as defined in the table of table 2 .
both slight and heavy bleeding occurs under the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in alone significantly less frequently than in the groups with Hep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ ocular , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular or surgical intervention , hem@@ at@@ oma with a diameter of ≥ 5 g / dl without apparent blood pressure level , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in spi@@ der of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood pressure , re@@ operation due to a blood flow , use of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed bleeding loc@@ ales , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; point points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ pod , ear , nose or throat .
the following data on side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in at 6000 patients who under@@ go a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in patients with Hep@@ arin were more common in women as well as patients over 65 years more likely to un@@ wanted events as with male or younger patients .

the binding of bees in Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ine , and thus its effect , is reversible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in has slowly split the binding of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby re@@ generates the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes which require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is administered sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the upper th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm or administered as continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce sufficient insulin for glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood , or the insulin can not process effectively .
insulin is@@ in differs very mar@@ gin@@ ally of human insulin , and the change means it has a faster effect and has shorter lasting effects than a short @-@ effective human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 5@@ 49 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in a study of type 2 diabetes , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adult .
the main inde@@ er for effectiveness was the change of the concentration of the substance gly@@ kos@@ y@@ li@@ zed ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed in comparison to a reduction of 0.0@@ 14 % in insulin @-@ l@@ is@@ per .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months , with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % of human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be applied to patients who may be inv@@ alid ( allergic ) against insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who suffer from hypo@@ glyc@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adapted , if it is administered along with a number of other medicines , which may affect the glucose level of glucose .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH to implement A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , to apply or sub@@ cut@@ aneous in@@ cut@@ aneous in@@ fusion by continuous in@@ fusion in the field of abdominal muscles .
due to the reduced glucose capacity and the dimin@@ ished insulin @-@ metabolism , the insulin needs may be down@@ lighted in patients with a limitation of the liver function .
any change in effect , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the insulin delivery ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ ink@@ delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change of insulin needs .
3 A inadequate dosage or termination of treatment , especially in patients with insulin requiring diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these states are potentially life threatening .
the change@@ over of a patient on another insulin type or insulin @-@ in @-@ another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage .
at the time of occurr@@ ence of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the re@@ profile of the used insulin and can therefore change in transformation of the treatment schem@@ as .
the substances that increase blood glucose levels and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ glyc@@ emia , li@@ gi@@ ot@@ ens@@ ine @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , di@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase , s@@ ali@@ y@@ ph@@ s and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
additionally , under the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ tics , such as Bet@@ ab@@ lo@@ ern , Cl@@ oni@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in and Reser@@ ves are the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gen counter@@ thro@@ es or missing .
animal experimental studies on reproductive sto@@ icity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ pre@@ ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin related to pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is exagger@@ ated in human breast milk , but generally insulin does not occur in breast milk , nor it becomes an oral application .
below are the results known from clinical trials , according to system organs and ordered after decre@@ asing the frequency of their occurr@@ ence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the data available ) .

severe hypo@@ glyc@@ emia with loss of consciousness can be treated with intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by an appropri@@ ated person or treated by intraven@@ ous administration of glucose by a physician .
after a glucose monitoring , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of cause serious hypo@@ glyc@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
insulin lowers blood sugar level by stimul@@ ating the periph@@ eral glucose consumption ( especially by skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be of insulin delivery occurs faster and the duration is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin therapy showed insulin resistance from 0,0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg to a dose of proportional glucose effects , and with 0,3 E / kg or more , a proportional increase of glucose levels , just like human insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucose level approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
the data was inten@@ tionally realised that after an application of insulin is@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post den@@ den@@ den@@ ial gly@@ cem@@ ic control is obtained , as with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
the insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal was taken , a better post den@@ oun@@ di@@ al control was reached when the meal was given , which was 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin @-@ ul@@ is@@ in takes 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control of the meal is given ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin delivery in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - before ) before the meal was given in comparison to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1A ) and in comparison to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before a meal ( Figure 1B ) .
insulin delivery in gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal in comparison to human normal conditions , which was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the meal ( Figure 1C ) .
