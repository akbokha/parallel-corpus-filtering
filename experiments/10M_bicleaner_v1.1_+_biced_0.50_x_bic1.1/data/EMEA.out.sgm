<seg id="1">The present document is a summary of the European Public Service Report (EPAR) in which explains how the Committee on Human Use (CHMP) has evaluated the conducted studies to make recommendations concerning the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your illness or treatment, please read the package details (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacists.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you wish for further information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and an injection solution (7,5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. Cast thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or vision of things that are not present), mistrust and madness; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental illness, in which the patients manic episodes (periods of abnormal flood) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic episodes, and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is applied to rapid control of increased restlessness or behavioral disorders, if the oral medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases, the solution can be used for inhaling or melting tablets in patients, which prepares the swallow of tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">Patients who are taking other medicines simultaneously, which are identified as Abilify, should be adapted to the dose of Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transfer between brain cells by "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances which allow the communication of nerve cells each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazene probably works as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole such as 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in less than the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine have played a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychological or manic symptoms and prevent their reunification.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify, preventing the recovery of symptoms, was studied in three studies by up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar illness, who had previously suffered a placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was tested for twelve weeks at 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo which had been stabilised to 160 patients with which the manic symptoms had already been stabilised with abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder which suffered from Lorazepam (another anti-psychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients was examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients receiving treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also introduced studies to investigate how the body uses the melting tablets and solution for insertion (up).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies, patients who received doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms of increased restlessness than the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the use of the bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition to 74 weeks, Abilify prevented the repeated manic episodes in previously treated patients and if there was additionally treated to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify-injections in 10- or 15-mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo and were similar to as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify for intake (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients), headache, blurred vision, dyspepsia (sinceration), spinal hypersecretion (increased memory production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disturbances) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Humanarzers (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Abilify in treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to serious episodes in patients who had mostly manic episodes, and of which the manic episodes were opposed to the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution for rapid control of increased restlessness and behavioral problems in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes at Bipolar-I disorder when an oral therapy is not suitable, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the placing of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is shown for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of the Bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manian episode in patients who had mostly manic episodes, and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day, regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased effectiveness in dosages of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as a monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar disorder in patients at least 65 years has not been proved.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of these patient groups should be considered a lower initiation dose when clinical factors are justifying this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 Inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripiprazene dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, also with Aripiprazene (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results from a epidemiological study showed that patients with bipolar disorder has no increased viewpoint risk with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazene should be applied to patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, cerebral heart failure, hypovolanemia, treatment with blood pressure-absorbing drugs) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials that lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports about during treatment with Aripiprazene.</seg>
<seg id="39">In case of an ABILIFY patients treated signs and symptoms of a late dyskinesia, should be taken into consideration, reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a mns, or unclear high fever without any additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripianzole should be applied in patients with seizures in the Anamnese or states who are related with seizures in the context of caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazene in patients who are associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripians were an elevated death rate compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixer dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to unwanted cerebrovascular events treated with Aripiprazole patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients that were treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related unwanted events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic drugs treated patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polythpsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar Mania due to comedibidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain as side effect is observed, and may result in serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is provided when Aripiprazene in combination with alcohol or other central-effective medicines are taken with overbearing side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased by 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects, and that is why other dose-reductions must be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolisation, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma centerings compared to CYP2D6 extenusive metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors, the potential benefit should exceed the potential risks for patients.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteashibitors, have similar effects, and that is why other dose-reductions must be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After replacing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosing of ABILIFY should be raised to the dosing height before the beginning of the escort therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escuopram) or CYP2D6 can be administered jointly with ABILIFY, can be calculated with a moderate increase in the Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg. Aripiprazole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethyoran / 3-methodology), 2C9 (warfarin) and 3A4 (dextromethyorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify her medical doctor if she's pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to inadequate data conditions on humans and due to the concerns incurred in the reproductive studies in the animal, this drug may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefit is clearly the potential risk of fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics the patients should be warned against getting dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripians have no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events occurred more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects were defined by the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks in patients who were treated with Aripiprazole, a total of lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akatheie, Dystonia and Dynic, compared to patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled study of more than 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% was below Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study for 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated with patients who were treated with Aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients suffering from Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes at Bipolar-I disorder - In a controlled study of EPS 23,5% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with semi-opidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% was administered in patients with Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, yielded no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Enhances of the CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripians treated patients compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the side effects associated with an antipsychotic therapy, the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinants and seizures, unwanted cerebral events and increased mortality of elderly dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, an unintentional or intentional abduction with Aripiprazole alone observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg, and without death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although no information on the effectiveness of a hemmodialysis in treating Aripiprazole, however, it is unlikely that hemialysis is in the treatment of a transfer of benefits as Aripiprazene has a high plasma connection.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is assumed that the effectiveness of Aripiprazene in schizophrenia and Bipolar-I disruption is communicated on the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and a antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and a moderate affinity to dopamine D4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, alpha-1-adrenergen and to the Histamin-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">At the gift of Aripiprazole in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily about 2 weeks of healthy volunteers the Positeboard-Emissions-Tomography showed a dosisdependent reduction of the bonds of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the Nucleus caudus and at the putpoint.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripians showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychological symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In one week 52 the proportion of patients who received a response to study medication was similar in one week, in both groups (Aripianzol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values of measuring signals defined as secondary stages, including PANSS and Montgomery Azberg- depressions-scale, showed significantly stronger improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of more than 26 weeks in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate, which stood at 34% in the Aripiprazene group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin controlled controlled dual blind study with schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients involved in significantly fewer patients receiving a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled Monotherapy-studies with more flexible dosage for 3 weeks with a manian or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazene showed a placebo over 3 weeks compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study about 3 weeks with fixer or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manian or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazene showed a placebo-based efficacy comparable to placebo in week 3, which was comparable to lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, Aripiprazol released 12 a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of the manie on how Lithium or Halopidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of more than 6 weeks with a manian or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without mental serotherapy, which are partly over 2 weeks not on lithium or Valproate-monotherapy in a superior effectiveness with the reduction of chronic symptoms compared to monotherapy, with lithium or Valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had reached a remission during a stabilising period of Randomanization, Aripiprazole demonstrated to placebo over the prevention of a bipolar response, predominantly in the prevention of a feedback in the Mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYPA4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for dehydration and hydroxyulation of Aripiprazole. the N-Dealkyation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean Elimination calendar time is approximately 75 hours for Aripianzene in the extenusive metabolism of CYP2D6 and at least 146 hours at 'bad' (= "poor") metabolizing over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripianzene there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as a pharmacokinetic investigation schizophrenic patients showed no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A Populations-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences in ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on pharmacokinetics by Aripiprazene.</seg>
<seg id="92">Pharmacokinetic characteristics of Aripiprazene and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study of subjects with various grave of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect concerning the impairment of liver function on pharmacokinetics and Dehydro-Aripiprazene, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw shots on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety-harmacology, toxicity in repeatability, reproductive oxicity, genotoxicity and the cervical potential, pre-clinical data provided no particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions which exceeded the maximum dose or exposure of the human being, so they only have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects associated a dosisdependent tributary accumulation (AUC) in rats at 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to the recommended maximum dose for people) and an increase of annex carcinoma (AUC) with female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10 times the middle steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for people).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was found as a result of the precipitation of sulphate-conjuades of hydroxy- metabolites of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (which is 1- to 3fold of the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations in the human species at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of hydroxy- Aripipraole were not found more than 6% of concentrations that were found in the study of 39 weeks in the Galle of Monkeys, and lie well below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages, which resulted in expositions of 3- and 11fold the medium-sized Steady State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="149">In case a parenteral therapy with Benzodiazepinen in addition to the Aripianaczole injection solution is considered necessary, the patients should be observed in extreme sedation or blood pressure (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Tests on safety and efficacy of Aripianzene injection solution are not present for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (by scanned or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazene should be applied to patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, cerebral heart failure, hypovolanemia, treatment with blood pressure-absorbing drugs) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials that lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports about during treatment with Aripiprazene.</seg>

<seg id="155">A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar Mania due to comedibidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain as side effect is observed, and may lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the Sedation was greater compared to the sole gift of Aripiprazole, in a study in the healthy volunteers Aripiprazole (15 mg dose), and which was administered at the same time Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2-antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blockers, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">Compared to CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolism, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma centrations of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- proteashibitors, have similar effects, and that is why other dose-reductions must be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After replacing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosing of ABILIFY should be raised to the dosing height before the beginning of the escort therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 lauazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly administered was the intensity of the sedding greater compared to the sole gift of Aripiprazole.</seg>

<seg id="163">The frequency of the side effects were defined by the following criteria: frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107. the following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant adverse events in clinical trials (*) (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled study conducted over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients below Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS acuity was 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, yielded no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Enhances of the CPK (Kreatinphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole patients compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>

<seg id="171">110 and behavioral problems was the Aripiaczole injection solution with statistically significant greater improvements in agility / behavior compared to placebo and was similar to Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder and behavioral problems and behavioral deficits associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms of integrity and behavioral problems in comparison to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">Observed average improvement from the initial value on the PANSS excitement Component score in the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9,6 for Lorazepam and 8,7 for Aripiprazene.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe conductightness, a similar efficacy was observed in terms of total population, but statistical significance could be determined due to a reduced patient level.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazene (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychological symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="176">In one week 52 the proportion of patients received in one Haloperidol study was similar to a response to study medication, in both groups (Aripianzol 77% (oral) and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values of measuring signals defined as secondary stages, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg depressions-scale, showed significantly stronger improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study conducted more than 26 weeks in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction of recurrence, which stood at 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Olanzapin controlled, multinational dual blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients involved in significantly fewer patients receiving a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of about 5.6 kg.</seg>

<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension of manic patients who had reached a remission during a stabilising period of Randomanization, Aripiprazole demonstrated to placebo over the prevention of a bipolar response, predominantly in the prevention of a return in the Mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">The Aripiprazol AUC is 90% higher in the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, 90% greater the AUC according to the same dose as a tablet; the systemic exposure was similar between the two mussels.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers the average time until reaching the maximum plasma intensity at 1-3 hours.</seg>
<seg id="184">The gift of Aripiprazene injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys, resulting in any direct toxicity of a target organ after a systematic exposure of 30 mg intramuscularly exposure to a systemic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive reactions after intravenous application, no safety-relevant concerns after maternal exposure, which ranged in 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) on the maximum human exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on the conventional studies with Aripiprazene (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity with repeatability, reproductive oxicity, and the cervical potential, pre-clinical data provided no particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions which exceeded the maximum dose or exposure during humans; so they only have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects associated a dosisdependent tributary accumulation (AUC) in rats at 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to the recommended maximum dose for people) and an increase of annex carcinoma (AUC) with female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10 times the medium-level-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for people).</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, a cholelithiasis was found as a result of the precipitation of sulphate-conjuades of hydroxy- metabolites of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (which is 1 to 3 times the average level of-state exposure or 16- to 81 times the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, of which three quarters had previously obtained an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole gift or as a monotherapy) was compared with the conventional paclitaxel containing medication (given in combination with other drugs to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In total, in the main study 72 (31%) of 229 patients with Abraxane treated patients to the treatment of 37 (16%) of 225 patients who received conventional paclitaxel stored medicines.</seg>
<seg id="270">In terms of patients who were treated for the first time due to metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference regarding efficacy and survival compared to efficacy and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">In contrast, patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel stored medicines earlier.</seg>

<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important incidents of side-effects listed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer, which were treated in the pivotal phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most striking haematological toxicity (79% of patients reported) and was quickly reversible and dosisdependant; Leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of the patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>

<seg id="300">Ruhelolessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity will be calculated based on a definitive issue in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency is possible and there was no significant connection with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubine drug which promotes the combination of microtubules from the tubulin-India and stabilized the microtubules by hemolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">These stabilization leads to inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network that is essential for the vitational interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumin conveys the transcytosis of plasma components in the endothelial cells and as part of in-vitro studies has been proved that the presence of Albumin to the transportation of paclitaxel by the endothelial cells promotes.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this enhanced transendoepithelial transport is conveyed by the gp-60 albuminreceptor protein and due to the fombined protein SPARC (retted protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation in the field of tumors.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two single-blind patients and 454 patients who were treated in a randomized Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion about 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer, which received an allergic reaction with paclitaxel at 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with premediation of allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as 30-minute infusion without conmediation (N = 229).</seg>

<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to the sound on baseline due to cumeline from Abraxane to &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the total-paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was identified in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The active exposition (AUC) increased linear range of 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>

<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume has a comprehensive extravascular distribution and / or soft binding by paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study of patients with advanced solid tumors, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-min infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="320">After a solvent paclitaxel injection, the Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher than after a solvent paclitaxel injection, and the volume of delivery was Abraxane higher (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue coating reports that Paclitaxel is primarily comprised to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metabolites (3 "-p hydroxyaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer was the average total dose of less than 1% of the combined total dose of less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxyaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates a comprehensive non-renal Clearance.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological medicine, which is already approved in the European Union (EU) and also contains the same active ingredient (also called "reference plate").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood cells, in which the connection with a blood transfusion complications may occur if before the procedure is not possible, and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">Treatment with seamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician, which has experience in the treatment of patients with disorders that is shown for the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood donors, sewing is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">Injection can also be carried out by the patient or his coach who provided an appropriate instructions.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal failure, or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the haemoglobin should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per decilite in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl of children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are to control in order to ensure that no iron deficiency consists of, and iron supplements should be given during the whole treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anemia may cause an anaemia caused by an erythropoietindeficiency or so that the body does not suffice enough to the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby minimize the consequences of a blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced to the formation of epoxetine alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared to an injection in a vein in the context of a main study with 479 patients who had caused anaemia to compare with the reference case.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study was injected for at least eight weeks of Eprex / Erypo into a vein before they were either converted to seamed or continue Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">Main indicators for efficacy was the change in haemoglobin values between the onset of the study and the study period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">Furthermore, the company presented the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin was speculated abseamed with those of Eprex / Erypo with 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients who had suffered from kidney problems caused anemia, the haemoglobin values of patients who have been converted to seamed are calculated in the same degree as in those patients who continue to Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In contrast, the patients continued to receive Eprex / Erypo, an increase of 0.063 g / dl. of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is a rise in blood pressure, which may occasionally lead to symptoms of a cephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, side detainable headache, and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed must not be applied in patients who may be invalid (allergic) against epoxetine alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems, since further studies are required to ensure that there are no allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee on Human Use (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the drug was provided according to the regulations of the European Union of proof that the medicine has a comparable quality, security and efficacy profile as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>

<seg id="386">Assessments and symptoms can vary depending on age, gender, and total disease of disease; therefore the evaluation of individual clinical trials and disease management is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in hemoglobins to be avoided by more than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Because of the variability between patients can occasionally be observed in one patient for individual haemoglobin values or among the haemoglobin targets.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of these hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be tried using the hemoglobin-target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value is inclined by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent hemoglobin value is 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoxetine alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that Epoetin alfa is in the lowest approved dose which is required for control of anaemia and accumulation of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl. or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) may need higher yield doses than patients where initial anemia is less difficult (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>

<seg id="401">Whereas the hemoglobin value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) or the tikulocytention increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, a response to the epoxetine alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be broken off.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (hematokrit 33 - 39%), with which the pre-binding capacity of ≥ 4 blood conservatives is required, the sewing should be obtained in a dose of 600 mg / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before the operative procedure.</seg>

<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit that is attributable to the gift of epoxetine, if the haemoglobin concentration will be increased to the control of assumptions symptoms and avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin increase should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal failure and clinical evidence coronary artery disease and insufficiency should not exceed the upper limit of hemoglobin-target concentration in paragraph 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present recognition, the treatment of anaemia with epoxetine alfa in adults with kidney failure, which are not yet dialysis, the progression of renal insufficiency is not accelerated.</seg>
<seg id="420">In tumour patients receiving antibiotic-efficiency of epoxettin alfa should be considered a 2 - 3-week delay between epoxetine alfa and the erythropoetin response (patients who may need transluded).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted to section 4.2, to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemical-related anemia - Dosage adjustment between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision for use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit risk reduction in the involvement of the particular patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>

<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg Zoledronylic acid in comparison to taking 30 mg of risedronat once daily during 2 months was proved in two six months comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">The results for the combined results was observed after 6 months, a similar decrease in pain-strength and pain-influence was observed in comparison to the initial value for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified at the end of the six months main study (on the therapy had been addressed) could be recorded in a follow-up period.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 by Aclasta and the 107 with risedronate treated patients who were involved in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response in 141 of patients with Aclasta, compared with 71 of patients with risedronate treated patients, could be maintained in an average duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg Zoledronic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dosisirrespective.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma concentration rose quickly to &lt; 10% of the maximum value to 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long lasting phase of very low concentrations, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Fast-phase of disappearance from the big cycle with half times t ½ α 0,24 and t 1 / 87 hours, followed by a long Elimination phase with an terminale Elimination period t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>

<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of Zoledroneic acid - concentration by 30% at the end of infusion, but had no effect on the area below the curve (plasma centration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished clearing of metabolic substances is unlikely because Zoledronic acid does not metabolic disorders, and because it is a weak or not / or irreversible, substance-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) the renal clearing of the coledronic acid correlated with the Kreatinine-Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Kreatinine-Clearance and was measured in the average of 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">As a result, a slight (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney function can be down to a Kreatinine-Clearance up to 35 ml / min.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public the present document is a summary of the European Public Service Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee on Human Use (CHMP) has evaluated the conducted studies to make recommendations concerning the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes) in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetic medication) can be applied together with another diabetesmedication (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin in patients (particularly overweight patients), that can't be adjusted with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with sulfonylharnstoff or insulin, the previous dose of sulfa drugs or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Actos treatment, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should be reduced to the dose of sulfonylene or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be utilized better and the blood sugar level has to be adjusted better, making type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos in tripletherapy was investigated; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphonyl harnbone, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glykosylized haemoglobin, HbA1c), indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value which suggests that blood sugar levels have been reduced from 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of Actos for existing treatment with metformin and sulfonylene in a decrease of HbA1c values increased by 0.94% while the additional administration of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin were examined in 289 patients, patients who took Actos in addition to insulin values increased by 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients who took placebo in addition.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events related to Actos were blurred vision, upper respiratory tract infections (cold, colds), weight gain and hypothesia (decreased sensitivity to friction).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos can neither be used in patients who may be invalid (allergic) to pioglitazone or one of the other ingredients, still in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high level of ketones - blood pressure).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos in the context of a monotherapy (in general use) is supposed to serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission awarded the Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for placing Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to white, round, arched and carry on one side the marking "15" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination with insulin patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate and insufficient for contraindications or tolerability (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, so the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treating the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase dosage.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when Pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">Cardiovascular Outcome study with Pioglitazon patients suffering from patients below 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and existing macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase in reports about heart failure, however, did not result in an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output of Liver Enzymes (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazon may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT-mirror increase up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range, the liver-enzyme values are as soon as possible again.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient is developing symptoms that point out to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unclarified nausea, vomiting, upper-degradation, tiredness, loss of appetite and / or dark harness, the liver enzymic values are checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of patients with pioglitazon continued, should be conducted by the laboratory parameters of the clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon, a dosing-dependent weight gain has been demonstrated, which is hereased by fatty deposits and in some cases linked to fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemodilution at Pioglitazon a minor reduction in intermediate hemoglobin value (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparatively controlled trials with Pioglitazon in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobins at 3-4% and hematocrits by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity in patients receiving pioglitazone or triple-combination therapy with a sulphonyl harnbone or dual-combination therapy with insulin-dependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch of the treatment with Thiazolidindions, including Pioglitazon, there was an appearance or a deterioration of diabetic macular edema.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pioglitazon and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescribed doctors should be aware of a macular edema if patients should report on disturbances of the vision.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of messages unwanted events relating to bone marries from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazon</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in patients treated with Pioglitazon treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the PROACTIVE study, a study about 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 frames per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazon patients, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of a pregnancy, and if a patient wishes a pregnancy, or if a patient is a pregnancy, the treatment is decreasing (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the investigation of interactions have shown that Pioglitazon had no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolised by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptive, cyclosporin, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA-Reductasinhibitor are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with the fibrouscion (a cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase of AUC of Pioglitazon about 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a lowering of AUC by Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the treatment with Pioglitazon which reduces hyperinsulin sensitivity and increased insulin resistance of the parent, and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic rate for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from present data not appreciated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the Turgors and the reindexes of the lens, as they may also be observed in other hypoglycaemic drugs.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon, ALT-Anstiege came across three times the upper limit of the standard range, commonly referred to as placebo, but more rarely than in comparative groups under metformin or sulfonylene.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with previously advanced macrovascular disease was the frequency of severe heart failure under Pioglitazon about 1.6% higher than under placebo when Pioglitazon bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch has rarely been reported on heart failure at Pioglitazon, but more frequently if Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the history.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of messages unwanted events relating to bone marries from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,100 patients in patients treated with pioglitazon treated groups and over 7,400 patients in patients treated with comparative mediation groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">Over a period of 3.5 years of current PROACTIVE study, fractures occurred in 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazon treated patients compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">On taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon appears on an activation of specific Core-receptors (PPAR-γ), which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeleton cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon increases the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose ranking in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as monotherapy has been continued for two years to investigate the time of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8,0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy, a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) could be maintained by pioglitazon in 69% of the patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo controlled study of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient despite three-day phase with insulin, to Pioglitazon or placebo randomised.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients with Pioglitazon, the mean HbA1c - worth 0.45%, compared with the patients who had continued to receive insulin; a reduction of insulin were observed in the group of pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, under Pioglitazon showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / Kreatinine-Quotives compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18 weeks study on type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma triglycerides and the free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- Cholesterinspiegel and low, however clinically not significantly increased LDL- Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazon reduced the total plasmatriglycerides and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to Plazebo, under Pioglitazon there was no statistically significant increase in LDL Cholesterinspiegel, while under metformin and gliclazid diminished values.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study conducted over 20 weeks of Pioglitazon, Pioglitazon also improved the post-dendial triglyceride level, this also improved over an effect on the triglyceride absorption as well as to the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the PROACTIVE study, a cardiovascular disease, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and previously existing macrovasculcular disease were randomized in groups of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular disease either Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral applications, Pioglitazon is resorted quickly, with the leading concentrations of unaltered pioglitazon plasma, usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the contribution of M-IV represents the effectiveness in roughly three times the effectiveness of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">Simultaneous application of pioglitazon with fibrosis (a cytochrome P450 2C8 - Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma centration of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral applications of radioactive pioglitazone in humans the marker was found mainly in the foot (55%) and to a lower extent in the harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean Plasma-Elimination Day of Unchangeable Pioglitazon is 5-6 hours, and the total active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma centrations of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function, lower than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of oral Clearance of Our Lady's substance is similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies, in mice, rats, dogs and apes coincide after repeated administration of PlasmaVolume enlargement, with hemodilution, anaemia and reversible heart hypertrophie.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the treatment with Pioglitazon which reduces hyperinsulin sensitivity and increased insulin resistance of the parent, and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic rate for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long term studies (up to 2 years old) the rat increased incidence of hypertension (male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urea epithelium induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of the familiar adenomatous polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other Thiazolidindions resulted in an increased frequency of colontology.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to white, round, flat and carry on a page the marking "30" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in patients treated with Pioglitazon treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the PROACTIVE study, a study about 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 frames per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazon patients, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In a further study about two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin each with Pioglitazon or Gliclazid were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, under Pioglitazon showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / Kreatinine-Quotives compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon did not only reduce the posture triglyceride level, but also improved the post-dial triglyceride level, this both have an effect on tryglyzerid absorption as well as to the hepatic trygroyd synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was lacking in regard to its primary endpoint, a combination of the overall mortality, non-lethal myocardial syndrome, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the Knuckle, coronarer Revaskularisation and Revaskularisation and Revaskularisation and Revaskularisation, lay the results near that the intake of pioglitazon do not constitute a cardiovascular risk.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to white, round, flat and carry on a page the marking "45" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of messages unwanted events relating to bone marries from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 7.400 patients who were treated with pioglitazon and showed a higher incidence of bone marries during women.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane was tested on a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, where the pancreas cannot produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes where the body is not able to use insulin effective.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study, after 12 weeks, the concentration of a substance (glykosylized haemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c mirror that pointed out that blood sugar levels were similar to a loss of human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be applied to patients who may possibly react sensitively (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, the doses of Actraphane must be adapted, if it is administered along with a number of other drugs that can affect the blood sugar (the complete list is to be stored).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee on Humanarzers (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Actraphane decrease in the treatment of diabetes across the risks.</seg>

<seg id="1438">During the subsequent replacement therapy of liver, kidney and cardiac transplants, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including transplantation, or other side effects, which can appear in succession of Tacrolimus sub- or overexposition.</seg>

<seg id="1442">In the prophylaxis of graft reactions in adult heart transplanting singers and transplant receivers, however, there are no clinical data for the retardant formulation.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions which may lead to a reduction of the tacular mirror in the blood and a weaker of the clinical effects of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements, St John's wort (hypericum perforatum) is included, or other plant products during treatment with adoration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the tacular concentrations in the blood is provided, as the Tacrolimus blood mirrors can be subject to significant fluctuations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, a program called Kardiomyopathy was called Kammer- or Septemhypertrophie, which can therefore be found under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are an existing heart disease, a treat with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function, infections, fluid load and oils.</seg>
<seg id="1447">Like with other immunosuppressants, the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk of malignant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of solar control with a high protection factor.</seg>

<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the rise of blood levels mainly from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus caused by the inhibition of gastrointestinal pollution.</seg>
<seg id="1454">High-dose prednisolon or methylprednisolon, as it is used in acute remedy reactions, increase the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Tacrolimus's effect on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as the CYP3A4 inhibitor; hence the simultaneous use of Tacrolimus with drugs which are metaligned with CYP342 metabolic metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As Tacrolimus put down the Clearance of Steroid contraceptiva and therefore the hormone exposition can increase is particularly cautious in decisions about receptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal trials have shown that tacrolimus can reduce the Clearance of Pentobarbital and phenazon and can extend their half-time.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a minor number of investigations on transplantations provide no indication that in comparison to other immunosuppressants, an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and result of pregnancy exists.</seg>

<seg id="1467">It was reported on benign or malignant Neopia including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumors in conjunction with the Tacrolimus treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialyzed.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Mode of action and pharmacologically dynamic effects on molecular levels are likely to be conveyed by the effects of Tacrolimus by its binding to a cynical protein (FKBP12) which is responsible for enrichment of the connection in the cell's cell.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calming dependent inhibitor of signal transaction due to the T-cell and prevents the transcription of a specific number of lymphocykin genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of T cells, further the formation of lymphocytes (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) and the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>

<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application apply after the treatment of bleeding or prevention of bleeding in surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor of VIII deficiency, which causes blood clots such as bleeding in the joints, muscles, or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but according to a method described as "recombinant DNA technology."</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced to the formation of the human body factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is a different product approved in the European Union called Recombinate, similar, but is otherwise manufactured, so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe chronic hemophilia A, including a study involving 53 children under six years, the application of the drug was investigated for prevention of bleeding and surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study the efficacy of advances in the prevention of bleeding within 86% of 510% from 510 new blood septics were awarded with "excellent" or "good" respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common adverse events of Advices (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, Pyrexia (fever) and formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advances must not be applied in patients who may be invalid (allergic) against the human scent factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein, or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG approval for marketing proposals in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage and duration of the substitution therapy are directed after the severity of the factor VIII-deficiency, according to the location and the extent of blood and the clinical state of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1542">For the following hemorrhagic events, the factor of VIII's factor should not fall under the specified plasma concentration (in% of the norm or in i.e. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impairment eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6 to 12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat until the risk is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment process, the dose of injecting dose and frequency of injections of the factor VIII, plasma concentration is required.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in their response to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and feature different half times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40, of factor VIII per kg body weight in a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII is not achieved, or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose, a test must be carried out to investigate an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that factor VIII is not effective so that other therapeutic interventions must be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The administration speed is expected to judge after the patient's request, with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known compensation in treating patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the propositional activity of factor VIII, IgG Immunglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing Inhibitors, correlated with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII, whereby the risk is based on the biggest and other factors within the first 20 Expositions.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 Expositions and anamnestically known inhibitorant, after switching from a recombinant factor VIII-product to another, the recovery of (lowest) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of the hemophilia A in women, there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs contained in the greatest number of patients were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients) that were all in previously untreated patients who have increased higher risk for formation of inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very frequent (≥ 1 / 100), frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000), very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), not known (frequency on the basis of available data is not invaluable).</seg>

<seg id="1561">In addition, none of the 53 pädiatrics patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnostic hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) was found by prior exposure to VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days) a FVIII inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Previously untreated clinical study were 5 of 25 (20%) with ADVATE treated patients Inhibitors against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of patients suffering from contaminated proteins was analyzed by the investigation of antibodies against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of antibodies against anti-CHO cell protein, otherwise no signs or symptoms based on an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the initial approval, the CHMP has continued to assess the benefit risk factor as a positive, but in consideration, the safety profile must be closely monitored in the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, CHMP is based on the basis of the safety profile of ADVATE, which makes a submission of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the regulatory owner has to apply another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited was officially distributed to the Committee for Humanarzers (CHMP) officially announced that the company has its application for approval for the import of advances in advance of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft parts (tissues, which combines other structures in the body, renders and relies) of it.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus, genetically modified so that it can bear a gene into the body's cells.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus" that has been changed so that there is no copies of itself, and therefore no infections can trigger in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin should be injected directly into the tumours and allow cancer cells to re-form normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the non-defect in the human body's existing p53 gene, normally contributes to restore DNA and kill cells, if the DNA can not be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient prior to the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the field of undermining, into the bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had examined the answers from the company on which questions were reviewed yet, some issues were unresolved.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the inspection of initially submitted documents, CHMP has compiled a list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">The CHMP's opinion was not sufficiently demonstrated that advances in Li-Fraumeni tumors bring advantages to patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration as well as the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not demonstrated that advances in reliable way can be produced and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient, is harmful.</seg>
<seg id="1653">"" "the company did not comply with the CHMP, whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or" "" "Compassionate-Use" "" "programs with Advexin." ""</seg>
<seg id="1654">"modified drugs" means that the tablets have been composed so that one of the effective components should be released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal rhinitis (hay fever, caused by a allergy against pollen) in patients with nasal smug smug (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">In adults and adolescents 12 years, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice a tablet twice daily, which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of treatment should be as short as possible and ended when the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended, because the effects of the drug may be refusing to constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The most effective measurements were the changes of the severity of the hypocrisp symptoms that were reported in the patient before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">At contemplation of all hay fever symptoms except for constipation of the nose reported the patients receiving Aerinaze's symptoms over a decrease of symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal smucosa showed, patients with Aerinaze showed a reduction of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients receiving desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachometer (cardiac infections), pharyngitis (throat infections), pharyngitis, headache, fatigue, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be invalid (allergic) against desloratadine, pseudoephedrin or one of the other ingredients, against adrenous molecular entities or Loratadadin (another drug for the treatment of allergies) are not used.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may not be used in patients that suffer from hypertonic glaucoma (hypertension), hyperthyrosis (hyperthyroid), hyperthyrosis (hyperthyroid), or have a hemorrhagic stroke (caused by a cerebral bleeding) or have a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On July 30, 2007, the European Commission granted authorization to SP Europe authorization for placing Aerinaze in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however, it is used to swallow (i.e. without them to break or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to misalignment and effectiveness (see Section 5.1) for children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after closing the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, as long-term application can take the activity of pseudoephedrin with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the threshold of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, treatment can be continued as a monotherapy treatment required.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze Pseudoephedrin contains, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients who are treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or within 2 weeks after the end of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity with combined use of pseudoephedrin with other vasoconstritors such as Bromocripitin, pergoid, Lisuride, pathologic or nasal as a wave of rhinologians (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, astoolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">Safety and effectiveness of these combination therapy were not tested for this patient collective and the data are not sufficient to address relevant recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of Aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function, and the data are not sufficient to address relevant recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that the treatment at the appearance of hypertonic or a tachykarma, or of palpitations, arrhythmias, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or an amplification of headaches) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In treatment of the following patient groups, patients with corrhythmic diseases • Patients with hypertonic diseases • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the history of the history, diabetes mellitus, blistering sobation or bronchids in the history.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before carrying out the matological testing, as antihistamine otherwise prevent positive reactions on indicators for skin reactions or reduce their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with desloratadine of which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered, no clinically relevant interactions or alterations of the Plasmaonzentration of Desloratadadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor test there were no significant differences between the patients treated with desloratadine and the placebo-treated patients regardless of whether desloratadadin alone or with alcohol was taken.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine was not identified yet so that interaction with other drugs cannot be completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadine inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4 not, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibits and neither a substrate, or an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The authenticity of the use of Aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase in frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since Reproduction studies in animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictor properties of Pseudoephedrin, Aerinaze should not be used in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">The patients should be clarified, however, that in very rare cases, it can occur in very rare cases that can lead to an impairment of traffic resistance or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS-depression (sedation, apnea, diminished spiritual attention, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collaps) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible letins.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headaches, anxiety, frightened Miktion, muscle weakness and increased muscle tensions, euphoric, arousal, breathing heart failure, heart rhythmities, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, preventive pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, blurred vision and hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is most likely in children, as well as atrophin typical symptoms (mouth-dried, popupliff, and dilatation, hood, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / Basophilen, as well as the expression of the expression of the hemorusolecüls P-selecine on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg has no effect on standard measurement sizes, including amplification subjective drowsiness or the tasks that are associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, at the recommended dose of 5 mg, no increased frequency of drowsiness was determined in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine at the recommended dosage can cause any more sympathetic effects, such as an increase of blood pressure, a tachykarst or manifestations of a CNS excitation.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal rhinitis, 414 patients receiving Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histaminantagonistic efficacy of Aerinaze tablets was determined based on the total score for the symptoms (except snooidal sskin), significantly higher than among a monotherapy with pseudoephedrin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the deplating effect, determined by the nasal smudskin, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">In a single dose study on pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, desloratadadin is present within 30 minutes after administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">Following the peroral application of Aerinaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days the flow-weight of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine in day 10 was reached.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of a pharmacokinetic multidisciplinary study which was carried out with the formulation of healthy adult patients, it was noted that four test subjects of desloratadadin badly disfigured.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interact study shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of Pseudoephedrin according to the sole gift of pseudoephedrine is the exposure to the gift of a Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional studies on safety-harmacology, toxicity for toxicity and reproductive stoicity, the pre-clinical data with desloratadadin may not recognize any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally consistent with the ingredient Pseudoephedrin.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductionstoxicology studies the combination of Loratadin / pseudoephedrine in the oral administration of rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and at a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day not teratogen.</seg>

<seg id="1722">Aerius was studied in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four trials in seasonal rhinitis and two trials in patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Efficacy was measured by the change of symptoms (itching, number, and size of quaddling, impairment of sleep and the performance in the day) before and after six weeks treatment was determined.</seg>
<seg id="1724">There were further studies presented to verify that the body utilizes the syrup, solution for inserting and melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the use of children are unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In allergic rhinitis, when the results of all trials were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius resulted in an average decrease of the symptoms (symptoms of symptoms) by 25 to 26%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both studies in Urticaria, the decrease of the symptoms after six weeks was compared with Aerius 58 and 67% compared to placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be applied to patients who may be invalid (allergic) against desloratadine, Loratadadin or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted authorization to SP Europe to implement Aerius in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once daily, with one or without a meal, to alleviate the symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There are partial experience from clinical studies on the effectiveness in the use of desloratadine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of intermediate-allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the previous disease process and can be resumed after the end of the symptoms and when the symptoms are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In the Persian allergic rhinitis (onset of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks) patients can be recommended during the infant time a lasting treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not determined in the context of clinical trials with desloratadin tablets containing erythromycin or ketoconazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study at the same time taking Aerius and alcohol has not intensified the performance of alcohol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">The patients should be clarified, however, that in very rare cases, it can occur in very rare cases that can lead to an impairment of traffic resistance or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">Clinical trials in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius, when patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most commonly found side effects related to placebo were fatigue (1,2%), mouth dry (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 adolescent patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side of headache was treated at 5.9% of patients who were treated with desloratadine and 6.9% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multiple dose study where up to 45 mg of desloratadine (Neunfold clinical dose) were given, no clinical relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / Basophilen, as well as the expression of the expression of the expression of the expression on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In a clinical study with multiple doses of up to 20 mg per day, a dose of up to 20 mg was administered daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovasculum effect was described.</seg>

<seg id="1743">In a single dosis- study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg has no effect on standard measurement sizes, including amplification subjective drowsiness or the tasks that are associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis was Aerius effective in the alleviation of symptoms such as sneetion, nasal secretion and itching of nose, itching, tear and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in saisonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can also be divided into an intermittent allergic rhinitis and Persian allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persian allergic rhinitis is defined as the onset of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown on the basis of the overall scores of life on the quality of life at Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively diminished by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was investigated for further forms of the Urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology is similar to the different forms, and chronic patients can be recruited by a simple prospectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamination is a significant factor in all urticular diseases, it is expected that Desloratadin except for the chronically idiopathic urticaria also leads to other forms of the Urticaria to an improvement in the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria Aerius was effective for improving puritus and the composition of size and quantity of Quaddles at the end of the first dose intervals.</seg>
<seg id="1752">Like in other studies with antihistamine in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines, was excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement of the itching bag by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadadin treated patients compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with aserius reduced the disturbance of sleep and vigilant significantly, as measured by a 4-point scale for the assessment of these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which patients were comparable to the general seasonal Rhinitis-Population, a higher concentration of Desloratadadin was achieved in 4% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no evidence for a clinical-relevant cumulation after once daily use of Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine was not identified, however, that interaction with other drugs are not entirely excluded</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibits and neither a substrate, or an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dosisstudy with desloratadine in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fettered, calorie rich breakfast) did not apply to the availability of Desloratadadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The clinical trials carried out by desloratadine and Loratadin who showed a comparable degree of exposure of desloratadine, no qualitative or quantitative differences in terms of toxicity related by desloratadine and of Loratadadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on the conventional studies on safety-harmacology, toxicity with repeatability, genotoxicity and reproductive stoicity, the pre-clinical data with desloratadadin have no particular dangers for humans.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. was officially distributed to the Committee on Human Rights (CHMP), that the company receives its application for approval from Aflunov to prevent caviar H5N1 influenza in adults and older men.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be applied for adults and older people to protect flu, caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the Influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine, which might cause a trunk to the flu virus that could cause future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out if a new strain of the flu virus emerges that can easily spread human immunity, because people still have no immunity (no protection).</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the parts of the influenza virus as "body foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is able to form an instant antibody in contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane cover of the virus was separated with the "surface antigens" (proteins on membrane surface, detects the human body as body foreign), cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">By this way, the scope of clinical data base for evaluation of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA region's guidelines for preventive vaccines.</seg>

<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenera stands as a solution to insert, but they cannot be taken together with Ritonavir because the safety of this combination was not examined.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenera should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked the antiviral drugs of the patient earlier, and the likelihood has judged that the virus will address the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients on twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, together with 100 mg of Ritonavir and other antiviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenera depends on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenera reduces the HIV-quantity in combination with other antiviral drugs the HIV-quantity in the blood and holds them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS does not cure AIDS, however, the damage of the immune system, and so that the development of HIV-related infections and diseases can also be delayed.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenera was studied in combination with other antiviral drugs, but without Ritonavir, studied in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who previously had not been treated with proteasants.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This with low doomed rite-reinforced drugs Agenera was compared with 206 adult, which previously used proteasmine inhibitors, compared with other proteasinhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Main indicators for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-provable concentrations of HIV in the blood (viral load) or change of the viral load after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies of patients who had previously had no proteasmine inhibitor, after 48 weeks more patients had a virus last less than 400 copies / ml as under placebo, but Agenera was less effective than invertebr.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenera also decreased the viral load, but with the children who had previously been treated with proteasmine, only very few were on the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with proteasmine eyelids, the viral load increased after 16-week treatment as effective as other protagonist inhibitor:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other proteasmine inhibitors, it came under Agenerase together with a more powerful waste of the viral load after four weeks as in the patients receiving their previous protease.inhibitor:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenera (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (nausea), vomiting, skin rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenera must not be applied in patients who may be insensitive (allergic) against ambabor or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenera can also not be used in patients, the St John's wort (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or pharmaceuticals, which are the same as Agenerase and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood of health.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who are taking Agenera, the risk of a podystrophy (alterations in the distribution of body fat), an osteonoarthritis (onset of bone tissue) or an immune activation syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by which recovers the immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee on Human Use (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral drugs are treated with HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">In general, Agenera is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifiers, but the committee found that the benefit of Agenerase in combination with patients who had previously not demonstrated proteasmine inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenera was originally approved under "exceptional circumstances," since the approval of scientific reasons only limited information.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000 the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited made a permit for the placing of Agenera in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenera is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, proteasinhibitors (PI) -anterior adult and children over 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usually Ageneric capsules are to be administered to pharmacokinetic boosters of ambabor together with low doses of ritual cavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Ambabor should take place under consideration of the individual viral resistance and treatment of patients (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Ambabor as a solution to insert is 14% lower than in Ambabor as capsule; therefore, Ageneric capsules and solution to intake a milligram per milligram is not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg of Ambabor twice daily together with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2. if Ageneric capsules are used without the amplification (boosting), higher doses of Agenera (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Ageneric capsules is 20 mg of ambabor / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily average of 2400 mg of ambabor that should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Agenera in combination with low doses of Knights or other protagonists were not studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenera is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the failure of data on the authenticity and effectiveness (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of retase capsules in adult patients should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunctions to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be carried out in patients with mild or moderate liver problems, in patients with severe liver function, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenera must not be given simultaneously with medicines that possess a low therapeutic width and also substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal supplements, which contain curwort (hypericum perforatum), may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasmakefulness and a diminished therapeutic effect of ambabor during intake of ambabor (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">The patients should be pointed out that Agenera or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that it continues to develop opportunistic infection or other complications of an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including the Agenera, does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">For usually Ageneric capsules are to be used together with low doses of knights and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who suffer chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an antiretroviral combination therapy, have increased risk of severe liver incidenies with potentially fatal processes.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of an antiviral viral treatment of hepatitis B or C please refer to the relevant technical information concerning this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with existing liver function including an chronically-active hepatitis indicate increased frequency of liver function under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Agenera and Ritonavir with Fluticason or other glucoquorrhoids, which are being confused about CYP3A4 is not recommended, unless the potential benefit of treatment has a risk of systemic cortisoider effects including Morbus Cushing and Suppression of the annex function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG-CoA-Reductase inhibitor of CYP3A4 is dependent on a simultaneous administration of Agenera with Lovastatin and Simvastatin because of the increased risk of myopathies including rhubarb olymers.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause serious or threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under monitoring of the International standardization Ratio), methods are available to determine the concentration of drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who take this medicine at the same time, asurase may be less effective for reduced plasma concentration of ambabor (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Because of the possibility of metabolic interaction with ambabor, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptiva can be changed, however, information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interaction.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with ambabor, patients should therefore be monitored on obpiatal symptoms, especially if there are still low doses of knights.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the possible risk of a toxicity in toxicity due to the high propylation content of the Agenera solution, this formulation of children under a age of four years is contraindicated and should be applied to caution regarding certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenera should be set to 5 if a skin rash is accompanied by Systemic or allergic symptoms or are involved in the mucous membranes (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients who received antiretroviral therapy, including proteasinhibitors, was reported on the onset of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an excitation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases, which were necessary medications were linked to the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with drug-dependent factors such as a longer lasting antiretroviral therapy and associated metabolic disorders associated with.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hammophiles patients (type A and B), which were treated with proteasmine eyelids, reports on an increase of bleeding including spontaneous coaches haemans and hemmarthrosis.</seg>
<seg id="1957">At the time of the introduction of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), an inflammatory reaction to asympatic or residual Opportunistic infection can result in severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multi-factorial etiology is accepted (including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecsis, were reported in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrate with low therapeutic width Aretase cannot be given simultaneously with medicines that possess a low therapeutic width and also substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenera with Ritonavir must not be used together with medicines, whose active ingredients are mainly related to CYP2D6 and associated with increased plasma bars with serious and / or threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin caused a 82% reduction in AUC of Ambabor, which can lead to a virological failure and result in resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to balance the humiliation of other protease inhibitors in combination with ritual cavir, very often unwanted effects were observed in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Ambabor can be humiliated by simultaneous use of vegetable preparations with curvwort (hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient is already taking curvraut, the Ambulavirlikeness and, if possible to check the viral load and abduct the St John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adjustment for any of the drug is not required if Nelfinavir is administered along with ambabor (see also Elieve below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, for Cmax at 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) is administered in combination with ambabor capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, dosages of 600 mg of Ambabor were used twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, which occupy the efficacy and uncertainty of this treatment schemes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower when Ambabor (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Knights twice daily) was administered.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Ambabor in plasma, which have been reached in combination of ambabor (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than Ambabor (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosing recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Ambabor and Kaletra can't be given, however, it is recommended to be engined monitoring, because the effectiveness and uncertainty of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study carried out in combination with didanosin combination, but is recommended due to the antacid component of didanosin, however, that the revenues of didanosin and Agenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antacids below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with ambabor (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adaption is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with irritability in combination with ambabor and Saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both proteasinhibitor would be erlow.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin to other proteasinhibitor and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapin may be sunk the serum concentration of Ambabor.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If this drug should be used at the same time, caution is advisable because Delavirdin could be less effective because of the diminished or potentially subtherapeutic plasma bar.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If this drug is applied together, caution is provided; a thorough clinical and virological supervision should be made, as an accurate forecast the effect of the combination of ambabor and knights on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of Ambabor and Rifabutin led to an increase in Plasmaonzentration (AUC) by Rifabutin, 193% and thus an increase in Rifabutin connected side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If necessary for clinical reasons, Rifabutin is necessary for clinical reasons, becoming a reduction in Rifabutin at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with aspirase in combination with erythromycin were not executed, but could be increased by the plasma concentration of both medicines in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fossilenavir and 100 mg of Ketoconazole once daily led to 2,69times compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg of ketoconazole once a day without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ketoconazole.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitor or Inductors of CYP3A4 may, if they are used together with Agenera, may result in interaction.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Therefore, patients should be connected to toxic reactions to be monitored by these drugs, if they are applied in combination with Agenera.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other proteasinhibitor, it is advisable that antacids can not be taken at the same time as Agenera, as it can come to resorption disturbances.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulva which are known as an enzyme ductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepin), with ambabor can result in a degradation of the plasma bar of Ambabor.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum-concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipin, dilatpin, Nicardipine, nifedipin, nippin, nippin, nippin, nippin, nippin, nippin, nippin, nippin, nippin, diaphragpin, can be increased by Ambabor, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of this drug.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous intake with Agenera can also increase their plasmakonations in connection with PDE5 inhibitors in connection to the side effects including hypotension, blurred vision and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of test were given, the endogenous cortisol increased by approximately 86% (90% reduction interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous Gift of Agenera with Ritonavir is not recommended with these glucose concentrations, unless the potential benefit of treatment is the risk of systemic cortisoider effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">In HMG-CoA-Reductase inhibitor, such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose proliferation of CYP3A4 is dependent, the plasma concentration of the plasma bar is expected to be present.</seg>
<seg id="1990">As Plasmaspiration increases of these HMG-CoA-Reductase inhibitors, including a rhubarb olysis, the combined application of this drug may not be recommended with ambabor.</seg>
<seg id="1991">There will be a frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations up to stabilization of the mirror, as the plasma centrations of Cyclosporin, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased with the same gift of Ambabor (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenera must not be used along with oral mdazolam (see section 4.3) while in simultaneous use of Agenera with parenteral Midazolam caution.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral Midazolam with other protagonists prove to a possible increase in plasma concentration of Midazolam for 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered along with Ambabor, patients should therefore be monitored on obpiatal symptoms, especially when they are given low doses of knights.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the tolerability of historical comparability of historic comparisons, no recommendation can be given, such as Ambulavir- dosage is administered at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With the same gift of Warfarin or other oral anticoagulies along with Agenera, an increased control of INR (International standardization Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of a weaker or reinforcement of the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraction is not predictable, as well as alternative methods for contraception is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (such as desipramin and nortryptilin) is recommended in the same gift of Agenera (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">However, during pregnancy, this drug may only be used to treat the possible risks for the mother compared to the possible risks of the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk lactic rats, Ambabor related substances were not known, however, it is not known whether Ambabor on human breast milk is over.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproductive study of pregnant rats, which was administered by the income in the uterus at the end of the stagnation of Ambabor, showed a diminished increase in 12 body weight during the stagnation period.</seg>
<seg id="2002">Further development of the income including fertility and reproductive ability was not impacted by the administration of Ambabor on the mother's animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The inability of Agenera was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Agenerase Treatment were light up to moderate, took up early and resulted in a rare case of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clarified whether they are related to the treatment of Agenera or another at the same time for HIV treatment, or if they are a consequence of the disease disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the above-mentioned side effects date from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006) in which proteasinhibitors were not treated 1200 mg of Agenera twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were classified by the test in connection with study medication, and in more than 1% of patients were performed, as well as under the treatment of laboratory changes (grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with HIV patients (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and faless fat tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophie the breasts and dorvivial fat accumulation (Stierning).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral non-treated people who had been treated with ambabor in combination with Lamivudin / Zidovudin over a medium term of 36 weeks, only a case (Stierning) was observed (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006, at 245 NRTIER previously treated patients under Ambabor 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241-patients with indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs about a medium duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0,001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rash usually were mild to moderate, erythematous or maculopapulous nature, with or without itching and occurred during the second course of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without having to be broken off with ambabor.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteonecsis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">At the time of the introduction of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), an anti-antiretroviral therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory response to asympatic or resistant opportunistic infection (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">In case of pre-treated patients that received 600 mg of Agenera twice daily along with low dogmatized knights (degree 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (grade 3 to 4) and laboratory changes (grade 3 and 4), which were among alluglycerides and CPK values that were treated in patients who received Agenerase together with low dogmatized knights.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of an overbursation, the patient is to observe signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, necessary support measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Ambabor binds to the active centre of the HIV-1 protease and avoids the process of process viral gag- and gag-pol- polyproteins present with the consequence of a formation of unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Ambabor in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was investigated both acute and chronic lymphocytic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as to peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmkonzentration (IC50) of Ambabor is in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µm in infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µm for chronic infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Ambabor against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of the HIV-1 replication in humans are not defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral non-treated patients with the currently registered Fossilenavir / Ritonavir-dosages - like in other rite-related treatment schemas with proteaseinhibitors - the mutations described only rarely were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the sixteen of 434 antiretroviral non-treated patients who received 700mg of Fossilenavir with 100mg Ritonavir twice daily in the study ESS100732, a virological failure could be investigated by week 48, with 14 isolates genotypic.</seg>
<seg id="2022">An genotypical analysis of the ages of 13 of 14 children, with which a virological failure in the 59 were included, showed resistance samples which were similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, MP3R, V32I, I54W, I3V, I50V, I54W, A71V, V77I, I82a / I, I84V, I85V, L90M, and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003, an extension of APV30005 (700 mg of Fossilenavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice a day: n = 107) with proteasmine eyelids previously treated patients with virological failure over 96 weeks, the following proteasinhibitor mutations on:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Based on genotypical resistance based analyses of genotypical interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of Ambabor / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease.inhibitor isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-11-Algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations L10F / I, L33F, I36I, I54F and L90M in conjunction with an increased phenotypic resistance to Fosamprenavir with a reduced probability of an virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mutations or mutations can be subject to any additional data, and it is recommended to always draw the current interpretations to analyze the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phphenotypic resistance based analyses in conjunction with the genotypical data analyzing systems can be used in conjunction with the genotypical data to estimate the activity of Ambabor / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease.inhibitor isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies who sell diagnostic resistance tests have clinically developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs (dividers) for FPV / RTV, which can be applied to the interpretation of a resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Ambabor associated genetic pattern generates a certain cross-resistance against ritual cavir, the sensitivity to Indinavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinavir remain generally consistent.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on the cross-resistance between Ambabor and other proteasants for all 4 Fossilenavir resistance fighters, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral non-treated patients with which a Fossilenavir / Ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), inavir / ritual cavir (three of 25 isolates), inavir / ritual cavir (three of 25 isolates), Saquinavir (three of 24 isolates), Saquinavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tidenavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 insulates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, Ambabor retains its activity against some other proteasmine inhibitors; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and from the type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early departure of a reconciling therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations in boundaries which can affect the following treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The proof of the effectiveness of Agenera in combination with rite-avir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study, in which PI treated twice daily) and nucleosidanaloga (NRTI) or a standard of nucleo (standard of care, SoC) with a PI, predominantly with a lower rite level.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred threessixty-sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the research study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis introduced the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the time-adjusted average changes from the initial value (AAUCMB) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-signatories of 0.4 logical 10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The proof of the effectiveness of indexed Agenera is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Ageneric solution for intake and capsules in dosages of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dosizing Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs together with Agenera.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of the study included a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74).</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on these data should be considered to be considered the benefit of "unbleaching" Agenera in case of therapy optimization.</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average length (Tmax) up to the maximum serum concentration of Ambabor is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, for Cmax reduced by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) were administered along with ambabor (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Ambabor with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Ambabor 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the food intake, although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and the rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent supply volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg) and allows for a large distribution volume as well as an unlocked penetration of ambabor from the blood circulation into the tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of the effect in plasma, with the amount of uncoated Ambabor, which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of uncoated Ambabor remains constant, the percentage of free active changes in the steady concentration in the steady state across the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">This drug may therefore have to absorb or absorb the CYP3A4 or a substrate of CYP3A4, if they are given at the same time with Agenera (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily Ambabor exposure such as adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ambabor is from the solution 14% less flexible than from capsules; therefore, Agenera solution and Agenera capsules are not interchangeable on a milligrammar base.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also the renal Clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, hence the effect of renal function is likely to be reduced to the elimination of ambabor and knights.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatments lead to ambabor-plasmasculum comparable to those who were achieved in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Ambabor twice daily without simultaneous order of knights.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies of carcinogenicity with ambaboo in mice and rats occurred with male animals benigne hepatocellular Adenome with dosages to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8- fold (rat) of the exposure to humans, according to twice daily gift of 1200 mg Ambabor.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for patients with sighted diagnosis of a Muengysacchariotine I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological symptoms of the disease (the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves in connection).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glyceraminoglykane, gag) are not dismantled, resulting in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can appear: enlarged liver, stiff joints, the movements make difficult, diminished lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be supervised by a physician, which has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should be performed in a hospital or hospital with revitational instruments, and patients may need to prevent any prescription drugs in order to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, however, the safety of the drug was investigated, however, its efficacy was measured by reducing its effect in terms of reducing the concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years Aldurazyme senate the concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, skin rash, arterial pain (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat-feeling, fever and reactions to the infusion site.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients below five years are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement of lung function), tachycarat (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be invalid (allergic) on laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic reaction), not to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will commence every year all new information which may be announced, and to update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyms will receive patients who observe aldurazyms regarding the reactions to infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission acquired Genzyme Europe B.V. for placing allocyms in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduristan and is produced by recombinant DNA technology under the use of CHO-mammals (Chinese hamster ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicative of long-term enzyme therapy in patients with sighted diagnosis of a Muengysacchariotine I (MPS I, α -L-Iduristan deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be performed by a physician, which has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial inclusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient is wearing it, all 15 minutes in single steps can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyms in patients with kidney or liver failure was not identified, and for these patients no dosing scheme is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme patients can develop infusion reactions that are defined as any other side effect, which occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored, and the infusion of Aldurazyms should only be made available in an appropriate clinical environment, where revitalising installations are immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, it is expected to form nearly all patients IgG antibodies against Laronidase, usually within 3 months of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution by using Aldurazyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As little experience regarding the recovery after a longer break-in, it must be cautious because of the theoretically increased risk reaction after a disruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the infusion of medication (antihistamine and / or antipymiska) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a mild or moderate infusion-related reaction, treatment with antihistamine and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be avoided and / or reduction of the incidence rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, infusion must be stopped, until the symptoms are brought to decrease, treatment with antihistamine and paracetamol / ibuprofen is considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion can be resumed with a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamine and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) and a reduction of the incidence rate of 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate, which occurred to the previous reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or procain because a potential risk of interference with intracellular absorption of laronidase exists.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not release direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns, which were exponally exposed to laronidase on breast milk, is recommended, while treatment with Aldurazyme is not to be silent.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The adverse events in clinical trials were constituted mainly as infusion reactions that were observed in 53% of patients in phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study. participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year) were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted medicines in connection with Aldurazyms, which were observed during the phase 3 trial and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years, are very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related participation of the upper respiratory tracts and lungs in history occurred severe reactions, including bronchids, respiratory and facial expression (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted medicines in connection with Aldurazyms, which during a phase 2 study, with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years, with predominantly heavy comparing form and treatment duration of up to 12 months, were reported in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 e / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 e / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients, it occurred within 3 months after the onset of treatment to a server version, with a severe failure rate in the age of 5 patients (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">By the end of the Phase 3 study (or up to a premature departure from the study), 13 / 45 patients were detected by Radioimmunopausation (RIP) Assay before, including 3 patients who never came to seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with reduced to low antibodies had a robust reduction in the Gag spammels in the Harn while in patients with high antibodies could determine a variable number of Gag in the Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal fluid to low neutral-neutral effect on the enzymatic Laronidase- activity in vitro, which seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of gag in the Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear in connection with the incidence of undesirable drug reactions, even if the occurrence of undesired pharmacological reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The justification for the enzyme therapy is in one for hydrolysis of accumulated substrates and preventing a further accumulation of sufficient restoration of enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="2315">According to intravenous infusion, laronidase is quickly removed from the circulation and administered by cells into lymphoosomes, the most probable of Manni-6-phosphat- receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the total disease spectrum was found, the majority of patients from the mean phenotype and only one patient had the serious phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had an increased expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">Primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open-label extensions study, where they received another 3.5 years (182 weeks) every week 100 e / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme treated patients from the placebo group to improve the lung function and the hearing that is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease of expected procentual FEV is clinically significant over this period of clinically and the absolute lung volumes increased significantly proportional to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of 26 patients with hepatic reactions before treatment reached 22 (85%) until the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a clear waste of the Gag-mirror in the Harn (µg / mg of Kreatinine) was found until the study remained constant.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Concerning the heterogeneous diseases between the patients that has been taken into account the clinically significant changes for five efficacy variable (at the expectant normal FEV, range in 6-minutes-test, range of movement of the shoulder-edge AHI and visual acuity), was generally an improvement in 26 patients (22%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A year-old open Phase 2 study was conducted, mainly the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme in 20 patients who were examined at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old (16 patients with heavy soiling form and 4 with the middle course form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">At four patients, the dosage due to increased GAG- mirror in the Harn had increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a magnitude (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) was determined according to the Z-Score for this age group, whereas the younger patients with the middle comparing form had a normal spiritual development speed, whereas in the older patients with severe failure, only limited or not progress in cognitive development were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, investigations into pharmacologically dynamic effects of various Aldurazyme dosing schemes were performed on the Gag-Spiegel in Harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 e / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 e / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks may result in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions, a representation alternative; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemata is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will provide any new information that will be available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the drug may be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Pharmacokinetic profile in patients aged under 5 was similar to patients suffering from older and less affected patients.</seg>

<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of Pemetrexed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued during the whole treatment period as well as for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexate dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also have an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) in the week prior to the first Pemetrexed-dose as well as after each third stop cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving pemetrexed, each gift should be a complete blood image, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and a Thrombocyte counting.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should amount to &lt; 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose-examination will take place in the day of the Nadirs of the blood image or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the predictive therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">Following the recovery, the patients must be treated according to the notes in tables 1, 2 and 3 which are treated for ALIMTA as a monotherapy or in combination with Cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 blood flow.</seg>
<seg id="2383">If patients should develop non-ugly toxicity toxicity 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA, until the patient is before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be broken off when in patients after 2 dosing products, hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity. 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical trials showed no indication that in the age of 65 years or more in comparison to patients aged 65 years, an increase in the age of 65 is an increase.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to non-sufficient data for uncertainty and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, patients with a Kreatinin-Clearance were required of ≥ 45 ml / min. for all patients recommended dose adaptations.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a Kreatinin-Clearance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However patients with a liver function limitation of &gt; to the upper Bilirubin- border value and / or transaminase values of &gt; the upper limit of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0-fold the upper limit value (for presence of liver metastasis) is not particularly investigated in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored in terms of the bone marker and pemetrexed should not be administered to patients before their total neutrophilarsis was once again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Thrombo- cytotality of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose-reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute neutrophilation, thrombocytention and maximum non-ugly toxicity, such as they have observed in the previous treatment cycles. (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 hematological and nithatological toxicity, such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neutropenia was observed, if a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 has taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients with Pemetrexed patients have to be instructed to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophyltic measure to reduce toxic toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium kidney failure (Kreatinine-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) have to avoid simultaneous intake of non-cyclogistic (NSAIDs) for at least 2 days prior to therapy, treatment and mindful of 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients who are scheduled for treatment with Pemetrexed is required to avoid taking NSAIDs for at least 5 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients who occurred these events had relevant risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, existing high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation, in transducal space, a drainage of the effusion of the pemboxed treatment can be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events have been reported in clinical trials with Pemetrexed occasionally, when this drug was commonly administered in combination with another cytotoxic drug.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of attenuated live vaccine is not recommended (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of an irreversible shepherd of reproductive ability exists by Pemetrexed, men should be pointed out prior to treatment - Ginn to take advice regarding the sperm count.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min), high doses of non-steroid antiphlogistic (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage (≥ 1,3 g daily) to a reduced Pemetrexed excretion with the consequence of an increasingly occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore, caution is provided when patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinine-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid can be applied in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen (ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy, therapy and mindful of 2 days after the therapy with Pemetremixed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">As no data regarding the interfere with NSAIDs are required for a long half-time frame such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application with Pemetrexed for at least 5 days before therapy, must be avoided with pemetre- mixed at least 2 days before therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The major intra-individual variability of the eye status during the disease and the possibility of interaction between oral anticoagulence and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of INR (International standardization Ratio) when the decision was made to treat patients with oral anticoagulence.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of Pemetrexed during pregnancy, but as with ande- ren antimetabolites are expected during an application in pregnancy heavy birth defects.</seg>

<seg id="2610">The application in patients under 18 years is not recommended as to the effects in this age group do not be enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the drug prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as serotonin) to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies at 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">At chemotherapies that are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients who were treated with Aloxi chemotherapy alone (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with onfed offset patients (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">At chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients who were treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy (153% of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with onfed offset patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>

<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters, including the corresponding effects of onwheel and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the clinical trials, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the ventricular de- and repolarisation.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the ECG-effects of i.v. named Palonosetron in single doses of 0,25, 0,75 and 2,25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous administration follows an initial elimination of plasma centrations, a slow elimination of elimination from the body with an average annual half-time of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma percentage (Cmax) and the area under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally proportionally in the entire dose range of 0.3- 90 m g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to intravenous administration of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 cans, the mean postoperative (± SD) increase was measured at 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Out of pharmacokinetic simulations, that measured at once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg palonosetron in 3 consecutive days, total exposition (AUC0- ∞) reached a value of 0.75 mg. however, the Cmax was higher after the intake of 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% of the kidneys are eliminated, and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which have compared to Palonosetron over less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for metabolisation have shown that CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as unaltered drug made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a single intravenous bolt injection was 173 ± 73 ml / min and total clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver function are the terminale Eliminationshalbum- and the average systemic exposure with Palonosetron, however, a reduction of dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical trials, only after expositions observed, which are considered enough of the maximum human exposure exposure, which indicates a small relevance to clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 From pre-clinical trials found indications that Palonosetron can only block at very high concentrations of ion channels that are involved in the ventricular de- and repolarisation.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (every dose was given in about 30 times the therapeutic exposure of humans) that were given daily for over two years, resulted in an increased frequency of liver tumors, endocrine (pancreas, pancreas and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully-known, but because of the used high doses and because Aloxi is determined for a unique application, the relevance of these results are low.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) approved a negative assessments in which the authorization of approval for the placing of hepatitis C proposed by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution was recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicine called Roferone-A with the same veteran effective ingredient that is already approved in the EU (also called the reference supplement ").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long-persistent) hepatitis C (a virus infection in liver disease).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscope investigation indicates the liver tissue damage, and the values of the liver enzyme Alanin Aminotransferase (ALT) are increased in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which is stimulated to the formation of the active ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon used data to prove the comparision of Alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition, and purity of the drug, mode of operation, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the effectiveness of reference incline to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment of treatment on the drug (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns expressed concern that the data for the stability of the substance and the drug-market drug may not be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C based on the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A were similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After adjusting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease is retardant again in more patients than with the reference agent; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Aside from this, the drug was introduced in the study to investigate the question of how the body forms an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug), is not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be applied to the treatment of Impetigo (one with crucistenformation) and small infected Lazerations (Riss- or chipping), shortage and paralysis wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections, which have been proven to be proven or probably caused by methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not work against this kind of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied to patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age the skin surface is not allowed to be treated more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not speak to treatment two or three days, the physician should investigate the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of bacterial cells, in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies in the proportion of patients whose infection was diverging after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients with placebo spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected dogs, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together, about 90% of the patients were enrolled in the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo had been involved in the treatment of abscure (eitergeared hells in body tissues) or of infections, which have been proven or probably caused by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation of the contractor.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee on Humanarzers (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Altargo in short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections prevail against the risks: • Impetigo, infected small infirs, paratrocities, or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for placing altargo in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients who have no improvement within two to three days are supposed to be investigated again and an alternative therapy can be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of a sensitisation or heavy local irritation by the use of retapamulin ointment, the treatment is broken off, the ointment must be effected and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogens (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies with secondary infected wounds the efficacy of retapamulin in patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy is expected to be considered, if after a 2-3 day treatment there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected place.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The impact of the simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasmakefulness, which have been reached with people according to topical application on damaged skin, or infected superficial wounds, a clinical relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 after the oral gift of 2 times a day, 200 mg of ketoconazole increased the middle retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% Retapamulin ointment on a weakened skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, Dosiscustomizations are not required for any systemic treatment with CYP3A4 Inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproduction according to oral pill and are inadequate in terms of implications for the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retapamiculin of the gift of systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">If the breastfeeding is resumed / finished or the therapy with Altargo continued / ended, it should be between the benefit of the breastfeeding for the infant and to the benefit of the Altargo therapy for women.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials about 2150 patients with superficial skin infections who have applied Altargo, the most commonly reported side effect on the appointment was about 1% of the patients concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivatives of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passagerial (formerly pleurotus passagerial).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The reaction of retapamulin is based on the selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding capacity of the 50s of the bacterial ribosomes, which differs from the bindings of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data point out that the binding station ribosomales protein L3 is involved in the region of the ribosomal P binding centre and the peptidyltransferring centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding station, Pleuromutiline inhibited peptidyling, blocked partial P-binding interactions and stop the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Due to the local prevalence of resistance, the use of retapamulin appear in at least some of infection forms, an advice should be streaked by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity of retapamulin versus S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of failure to treat S.aureus the presence of tribes should be considered with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin).</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was carried out daily under occlusion to intact and halved skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days to the topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, single plasma samples were gained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients each before Mediation and children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic inclusion on people after topical application of 1% salbe on 200 cm2 were deported to 200 cm2. AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the retapamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibiting.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microsomen was primarily mediated by CYP2A4, under low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies of oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were conducted over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro review on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in rats-microcore test for in-vivo study chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats signs of restricted fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which reaches up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure of the human (topical application on 200 cm2).</seg>
<seg id="2713">At oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3-fold of the estimated human exposure (see above), development of development (reduced body weight of fetus and delayed exposure) and maternal mortality.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The holder of approval for the placing has to ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as shown in module 1.8.1 of the application form (version 6.2) is present and works before the product is marketed as long as the marketing product is applied.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of the approval program commits to implement detailed detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance procedures, as described in version 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP) as well as all the additional updates of the RMP certification, which are agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management System for Human Resources," the updated RMP will be submitted simultaneously with the next periodic safety update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or any other signs and symptoms at the treated spot, you should end the application of Altargo and speak to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Apply no other salts, creams, or lotions on the area that will be treated with Altargo if it was not expressly prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be used in the eyes, on the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment consists of one of these surfaces, wash the place with water and ask your doctor to counsel if complaints occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After entering the ointment you can cover the affected area with a sterile association or a Strip, unless your doctor has advised you to cover the area.</seg>
<seg id="2722">It is offered in an aluminium tube containing a plastic seal, which contains 5, 10 or 15 grams of ointment, or in an aluminum bag that contains 0,5 grams of ointment.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Ambient rix is used for protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children between one and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambient rix is applied within one of two doses of the vaccine, a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix must only be used if during immunisation a low risk of hepatitis B infection is ensured and ensured that the vaccine is made up of two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refreshment dose is requested against hepatitis A or B, ambient rix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine will be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by preventing the immune system (the natural defense of the body), "as it can resist a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens as "alien" and produces antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambient rix contains the same components such as the vaccine Twinrix adults, and has been approved by the vaccine since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccinations are applied to the protection against the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix are administered as part of an existing vaccination plan.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data used to support the application of Twinrix adult, also used as proof for the use of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indeer for the effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a month after the final injection of a protective antibody.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study involving 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambient rix resulted in between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children one month after the final injection on the development of anti-antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that ambient's degree of Ambirix at a 6-month distance between the injections was similar.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed at more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, loss of appetite, pain at the injection station, redness, Matsion (fatigue) and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambient rix must not be invalid (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002 announced the European Commission to GlaxoSmithKline Biologys.a. a permit for the placing of Ambirix in the entire</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for the basic dimming with Ambirix consists of two vaccine doses, whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a gap of hepatitis A is requested for hepatitis B and hepatitis B, it can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovalent vaccines or with a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis C surface (anti-HAV) anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HAV) anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HAV) antibodies are in the same size as according to the vaccination with the respective monovalous vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not fully secured, whether immune competent individuals who have referred to a hepatitis C inoculation, have a refreshment of protection as protection, as they may also be protected by the immunological memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection systems, in the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction to the gift of the vaccine it should be immediately available for medical treatment and monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization vaccine is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In hemialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies could be achieved in these cases, so in these cases the gift of further vaccination can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">As an intraocular injection or intramuscular administration may result in a suboptimal impetus, this injection system should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, at Thrombocytopenie or blood clots, ambient rix can be injected as an exception of subcutaneously in these cases, after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If ambient rix was administered at the same time with a combinant Diphtherie-, tetanus, azellular pertus- and Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">Patients with immunosuressive therapy or patients with immundefects have to be assumed that possibly no sufficient immune response is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study which was carried out with 3 vaccine doses of this formulation, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, Maternity, gastroenteritis, headache, and fever comparable to the frequency which was observed in the earlier Thiomerang and preservative-containing vaccine production.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, at a total of 1027 vaccine doses have been administered at a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 and including 15 years the tolerability of Ambirix was compared with the 3-tbsp combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and maturities on a calculation basis per vaccination dose. Ambirix, but not based on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 50.4% of the test subjects, compared with 39.1% in the subjects following the gift of dose of 3-cans combined vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle reported 66.4% of the subjects who had received Ambirix more than pain, compared to 63.8% of the subjects who have been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of Matcha was comparable (i.e. about the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the subjects who got Ambirix, compared with 36.2% of the subjects who received 3-doses combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of distinctive pain and humility was low and comparable to that was observed after administration of the combined vaccine with the 3-doses vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11-year-old vaccinations, the occurrence of local reactions and general actions in the Ambirixgruppe was comparable to that with the 3-dosing combination of hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, in the 6- to 11- year-old, however, following vaccination with Ambirix a Frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection station) per dose, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines that reported on severe side effects during the 2-doses vaccination schemas with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen reported was statistically not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials, which were performed in vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years, the serum-conversion rates for anti-HAV 99.1% were a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month 6 perverse dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serpentine rates for anti-hbs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month 6 perverse dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study that was performed in 12- to including 15-year-old, 142 two doses Ambirix and 147 received the standard combined vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">With 289 persons whose immunogeneity was extendable, the serum samples (SP in the table below) were significantly higher in the case against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 following the gift of 3-dose-carbonic acid higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response, which were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11-year-old a month after the end of the full vaccine series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies the vaccinations were either a 2-doses vaccination with Ambirix or a 3-doses vaccination with a combination of 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2767">The persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies could be demonstrated at least 24 months after immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response shown in this study was comparable to both antigens which was formed following vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine, consisting of 360 ELISA units formalinactivated Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- to including 15-year-old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs-antibodies could be comparable to immunisation in the 0-6 months vaccination in the 0-12 months vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix was administered at the same time with the conception of a combined diphtherie-, tetanus-, azellular pertus- and 8 Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study carried out with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults, demonstrated for the current formulation of similar napoprotectants and serpentine rates as for earlier formulation.</seg>

<seg id="2786">Instead, he will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of an effective proportion of hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface (hepatitis B surface).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of reduced content is commonly given a month after the first dose and may give you a vaccines at the end of the vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes ambirix is injected with people who are injected in severe blood clots, under the skin and not in muscle. if you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your own immune defence / or if you / your child are underlying / undertaking a hematalysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambient rix can be given in such cases, but the immune response of these people may not be sufficient, so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Sing your doctor if you / your child will receive further medicines (including those who have been vaccinated without prescription) or if you have been vaccinated or immortlobulins (antibodies), or has been planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it can be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both Hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given simultaneously with Ambirix, should be vaccinated in separate parts and as possible as possible as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If ambient rix are given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be enough.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, ambirix will not be given pregnant or lactating women unless they are vaccinated for hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if you have shown an allergic reaction to Neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2797">♦ very common (more than 1 case per 10 pimp cans): • pain or discomfort at enema or redness • Maternity • headache • loss of appetite</seg>
<seg id="2798">♦ frequent (up to 1 case per 10 pimp cans): • swelling at the injection unit • fever (over 38 ° C) • drowsiness • gastrointestinal complaints</seg>
<seg id="2799">Other side effects, the days or weeks after the vaccination with comparative combination or individual ingredients against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare (less than 1 case per 10,000 stored doses) are:</seg>
<seg id="2800">These include local, limited or broad marvel that can be itching or laundering-shaped, swelling of the eyes and facial, frightening atolls or swallowing, sudden blood pressure loss and loss of consciousness.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambient rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packages to 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data, which have been announced since issuing the first approval for the placing on the market, the CHMP said that the benefit ratio for ambirix is positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, because Ambirix was placed only in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug was limited due to the minor patient exposition.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonium can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hypersensitivity cephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammoniac concentrations) in pre-history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonium is divided - split by several single doses to meals - swallowed, among the food mixed or via a gastropod (through the stomach in the stomach of leading hose) or a nose sun (through the nose into the stomach of leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">No comparative study was, since Ammonaps could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo (a hypocritical medicine, i.e. without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonium can also lead to loss of appetite, a abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, liquor disease, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, skin rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee on Human Use (CHMP) reached the conclusion that Ammonary is effective in patients suffering from the urea cycle to high ammoniac values.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "Ammonary was approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "because due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information about this drug." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use of all patients are indexed in all patients in which a complete enzyme has already manifested in the newborns (within the first 28 days).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-firm form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself according to the first life of life), an indication of the use of a hypertext-based encephalopathy exists.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing, AMMONAPS is also available in granulatform.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually controlled taking the protein tolerance and the patient's growth and development of the patient's necessary protein intake.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a bodyweight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with a body weight of over 20 kg and with adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of Citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.017 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer an early-term deficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an Argininosuccinatsynthetase deficiency must be obtained in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with swallowing illness, as a risk for the emergence of Ösophagusulzera, if the tablets are not immediately entering the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, equivalent to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Therefore, AMMONAPS should therefore be used to treat patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure, as well as with sodium retention and edetion.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat is carried out over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should be applied to patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">At a subcutaneous gift of phenylacetic to young rats in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg) it came to a slowdown of the neural strength and to an increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed appeal of cerebral synapses and a diminished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thereby a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is eliminated in humans in the breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the lactation period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least an adverse event (AE) and at 78% of these undesired events that they had not been linked to AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A more likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anoretic patient who developed a metabolic disease, severe hypokalemia, panzytopenie, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an excessive dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg) in a 5-month old small child was one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms proceed with the accumulation of phenylacetic, which showed a dosistive neurotoxicity with a intravenous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetic is a metabolic link which is conjugated by Acetyformulation with glutamine to phenylacetyl glutamine, which is excreted by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Antibodies seen is phenylacetyl glutamine with urea comparable (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetyl glutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients suffering from the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram, sodium polyphenylbutyrate can be produced between 0,12 and 0,15 g phenylacetyl glutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is early and the treatment immediately started to improve survival opportunities and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The forecast of the early symptoms of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in the newborns was almost always infarist, and the disease carried himself with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their stickproof analogy within the first life year of death.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Due to hemialysis, the use of alternative ways of nitrogen compounds (sodium phenylbutyrat, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetic), proteins fell from postoperatively and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns in postpartal (however within the first life of life).</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it came with the time for many to spiritual disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-term form of the disease (including female patients with heterozygous form of the ornithintranscarbamberylase deficiency), which replenished from a hypertext-induced encephalopathy and then permanently treated with sodium phenylbutyrat and a protein reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurologic can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenylaclic, which is conjugated in liver and kidneys with glutamine, with phenylacetyl glutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were detected following the gift of a single dose of 5 grams of sodium phenylbutyrate in an empty healthy adult and in patients suffering from liver cirrhosis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites became also studied in cancer patients after intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetic.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral supplement of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma centerrations of phenylbutyrate were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients suffering from urea cycle or haemoglobies, phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) mean no phenylacetate in plasma on the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three of six patients with liver cirrhosis that were repeated with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in plasma concentration were five times higher than according to the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted within 24 hours to about 80-100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetyl glutamine over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">After the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyrate in with toxic and non-toxic doses treated no clastogenic effects (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral dosing a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is taken either by oral (infants and children who can't swallow any tablets or patients with swallowing illness) or via a gastro stomy or a nostride.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with a body weight of over 20 kg and with adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serumproteine in plasma should be held within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of Citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.017 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer an early-term deficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram sodium phenylbutyrate, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, equivalent to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">If rat kill before the birth phenylacetic (active metabolit of phenylbutyrate) were exposed to lesions in the pyramids of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A more likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anoretic patient who developed a metabolic disease, severe hypokalemia, panzytopenie, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Antibodies seen is phenylacetyl glutamine with urea comparable (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetyl glutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the excretion of excess weight.</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of research on the excretion of phenylacetyl glutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram, sodium polyphenyl butyrate can be produced between 0,12 and 0,15 g phenylacetyl glutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurologic can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">According to an oral supplement of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in granulatform 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma centerrations of phenylbutyrate were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of durability, the patient can store the finished product only for a period of 3 months at a temperature of over 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">For this purpose, the small measuring scoop 0.95 g, the middle measuring scoop 2.9 g and the large measuring scoop 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient must maintain the medicine above a probe, AMMONAPS can be dissolved in water (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot leave the stickled waste products that accumulate in the consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">In case of your laboratory studies, you must notify the doctor that you are using AMMONAPS, as sodium phenylbutyrate can influence the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>
<seg id="2866">When taking AMMONAPS with other drugs, please inform your doctor or pharmacists if you take other medicines or have recently taken care of prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During the breastfeeding you may not take AMMONAPS, because the medicine could go over into breast milk and could damage your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases, confusion, headache, taste disturbances, descendant of hearing, orientoriety, memory deficits, and a deterioration of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice one of these symptoms, please contact your doctor or your doctor's emergency entry to the introduction of a corresponding treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute Coronarsyndromes" (ACS, decreased blood supply to the heart), for example in unstable Angina (a form of pain in the chest with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "Stuplift" (an abnormal measurement value for electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is applied to prevent blood clots in patients that can undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered, and infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with Angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS of ACS, with the effect of angiox at all sole gift or in conjunction with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa-inhibitor (GPI, another drug to prevent blood clots) with the conventional combination of treatment with heparin (another anti-coagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI was often a stent (a short tube, which remains in the arterie to prevent a clasp), and they also received other medicines for preventing blood clots, such as Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">For the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without any gift of GPI - with the preventing of new events (deaths, heart attacks, or revisions) after 30 days or a year altogether as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who undergo a PCI was Angiox in relation to all indicators as effective as Heparin, except for heavy bleeding, with which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be applied to patients who may be invalid (allergic) against Bivalirudin, other Hirudine or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It must not be used in patients who had recently had a blood pressure, as well as people with severe hypertension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee on Human Use (CHMP) reached the conclusion that Angiox is an acceptable replacement for heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission announced the Company The Medicines Company UK Ltd. a permit for placing angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndromes (unabile angina / non-ST midmarket infarction (IA / NSTEMI), when an early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is a intravenous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg, followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is carried out in another sequence, an additional Bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention will be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI in clinical requirements, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4-12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg can be administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI is from an initial intravenous bolt of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and one of them immediately followed by intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a sole Bolus Gift of Angiox was not studied and is not recommended, even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value is shortened (ACT after 5 minutes) to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0,3 mg / kg / bodyweight should be made.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstitutionated and diluted medicines should be carefully mixed before the application and should be administered quickly intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1,75 mg / kg infusion dose is given correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function limitation (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which can be subjected to a PCI (whether using a bivalent case against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is less than 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg is sufficient to re-check the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which led to approval in phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2) that led to approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bivalirudin Bolus with an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also for dialysewage treatment, angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the completion of the intravenous heparin or 8 hours after the completion of the subcutaneous gift of Dutch Heparin</seg>
<seg id="2905">• A known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any other components or against Hirudine - active hemorrhage or increased blood risk disorders. • severe uncontrolled hypertonics and subacute bacterial diseases. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and in dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully inspected during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when Bivalirudin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if in the PCI-patient, most bleeding in the arterial position occur in most cases, patients who undergo percutaneous corporal intervention (PCI), may occur during the treatment in principle anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking warfarin and treated with Bivalirudin, a monitoring of the INR value (International standardization Ratio) should be drawn into consideration to ensure that the value of treatment with Bivalirudin should be achieved before the treatment existing.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Departing from the knowledge about the action mechanism of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or thrombocyte aggregators) may be assumed that these active ingredients increase blood risk.</seg>

<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding were defined according to ACUITY and Timi standards for heavy bleeding, as defined in the table of table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both slight and heavy bleeding occurs under the bivalirudin alone significantly less frequently than in the groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-inhibitor and Bivalidrudin plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraocular or surgical intervention, hematoma with a diameter of ≥ 5 g / dl without apparent blood pressure level, reduction of hemoglobin spider of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood pressure, reoperation due to a blood flow, use of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed bleeding locales, which occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" point points, retroperitoneal, gastropod, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following data on side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with Bivalirudin at 6000 patients who undergo a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalirudin group as well as in patients with Heparin were more common in women as well as patients over 65 years more likely to unwanted events as with male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both slight and heavy bleeding occurred beneath the bivalent arteries in significantly less frequently than in the comparative group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, were reported according to comprehensive application in practice, and are arranged according to system organic classes in table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of an overbursation, treatment with Bivalirudin is immediately broken off and to monitor patient engmaschig in terms of signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific thrombinicor, which binds both in the catalytic centre as well as at the Anionenbindrancion region of Thrombine, regardless of whether Thrombine is bound in the liquid phase or at the line of clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of bees in Thrombine, and thus its effect, is reversible because Thrombin has slowly split the binding of bivalirudin Arg3-Pro4, thereby regenerates the function of the active centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, through Bivalirudin with serum from patients who came in the past to heparininduced Thrombocytopenie / heparininduced Thrombose syndrome (HIT / HITTS), no Thrombocytes aggregate reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients, Bivalirudin shows dosis- and concentration-dependent anti-oxidant effect that is imposed by the ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was performed in the patient below the patient, an additional Bolus of 0.5mg / kg Bivalirudin was given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention will be increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, an unfractionated heparin or Enoxaparin was administered according to relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable Angina / non-ST midmarket (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes which require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is administered subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the upper thighs or the upper arm or administered as continuous infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce sufficient insulin for glucose levels (sugar) in the blood, or the insulin can not process effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin isin differs very marginally of human insulin, and the change means it has a faster effect and has shorter lasting effects than a short-effective human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was studied in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 549 adults and in a study involving 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In a study of type 2 diabetes, Apidra was studied in a study with 878 adult.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indeer for effectiveness was the change of the concentration of the substance glykosylized haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed in comparison to a reduction of 0.014% in insulin-lisper.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, lowering the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months, with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% of human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be applied to patients who may be invalid (allergic) against insulin lulisin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who suffer from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra must be adapted, if it is administered along with a number of other medicines, which may affect the glucose level of glucose.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH to implement Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, to apply or subcutaneous incutaneous infusion by continuous infusion in the field of abdominal muscles.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose capacity and the diminished insulin-metabolism, the insulin needs may be downlighted in patients with a limitation of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change in effect, the brand (Her- Steller), the insulin delivery (normal, NPH, zinkdelayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change of insulin needs.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A inadequate dosage or termination of treatment, especially in patients with insulin requiring diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these states are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The changeover of a patient on another insulin type or insulin-in-another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">At the time of occurrence of a hypoglycaemia depends on the reprofile of the used insulin and can therefore change in transformation of the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase blood glucose levels and increase the inclination to hypoglycemia, ligiotensine-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, dioxetine, monoamine oxidase, monoamine oxidase, monoamine oxidase, saliyphs and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Additionally, under the effect of sympatholytics, such as Betabloern, Clonidin, Guanethidin and Reserves are the symptoms of adrenergen counterthroes or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive stoicity showed no differences between insuprelinglulisin and human insulin related to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lulisin is exaggerated in human breast milk, but generally insulin does not occur in breast milk, nor it becomes an oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Below are the results known from clinical trials, according to system organs and ordered after decreasing the frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on the data available).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold weather, cool and pale skin, tiredness, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, drowsiness, excessive dog, changes of vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy fails to change the injection site within the injection device continuously, can appear in the sequence a lipodystrophy at the injection station.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemia with loss of consciousness can be treated with intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by an appropriated person or treated by intravenous administration of glucose by a physician.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose monitoring, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of cause serious hypoglycemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar level by stimulating the peripheral glucose consumption (especially by skeletal muscles and fat) as well as inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subcutaneous Ga- be of insulin delivery occurs faster and the duration is shorter than at hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin therapy showed insulin resistance from 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg to a dose of proportional glucose effects, and with 0,3 E / kg or more, a proportional increase of glucose levels, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a twice as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucose level approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data was intentionally realised that after an application of insulin isulisin 2 minutes before the meal, a comparable post dendendenial glycemic control is obtained, as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal was taken, a better post denoundial control was reached when the meal was given, which was 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin-ulisin takes 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a comparable glycemic control of the meal is given (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin delivery in gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the meal was given in comparison to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1A) and in comparison to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin delivery in gift 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the beginning of the meal in comparison to human normal conditions, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
