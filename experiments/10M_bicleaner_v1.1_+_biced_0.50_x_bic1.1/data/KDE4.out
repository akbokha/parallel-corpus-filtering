the package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; in spite of their low size , they offer some additional functions and simpli@@ fy the use of some features of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making these easier available .
for further information about using &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions you can find in the manual for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to set up these modules in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; set up settings , set up the card tools and select the required modules here .
this is a list with standard setup modules from the K@@ DE ; Ad@@ d@@ ons package . please note that you may have more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package that includes &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before using this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; click on Extras . then you can view the page that has brought &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , if present , delete .
the module filters ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under ex@@ tras . with the module you can filter &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current work directory on different way filters .
to view the DO@@ M construction supervision in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M which is currently displayed . as default , the display starts with the root notes of the document , for example : an element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root canal .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects with the M@@ IM@@ E type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbols and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
the partic@@ ul@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of showing @-@ called folder hier@@ archi@@ es with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . each object is shown by a rect@@ angle , its area is propor@@ tionally to its size . this size must possess the property that the sum of the size of the sub@@ ordin@@ ate objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; determines the size of a file or folder , with the size of a folder as the sum of the size of entries is specified . in this way , large files can be easily detected if they are far below in the folder hier@@ archy . in that way , &amp; FS@@ View may be regarded as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; -@@ command can be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap @-@ representation is a rect@@ angle , which represents a file or file in your file system . to simpli@@ fy navigation possess the rect@@ angle of meaningful colour and labelling settings .
the colour of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over color mode , can be either depth for the easy detection of screws or the picture of any other file association like name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different characteristics of the respective file or folder . for each property , you can define if there is enough space to display , or if the area of sub@@ ordin@@ ates can be used , or if the surface of sub@@ ordin@@ ates may occur . furthermore , you can define the relative position of the lab@@ eling in the rect@@ angle .
at installation algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps should the rule be observed that the surface is proportional to size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always held . note that less space is not available for frame entries , if the rect@@ angle is square .
as the arrangement of a entry was done to the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries , the implementation will be left to it . here , it is necessary for labelling and to avoid plac@@ ements by framework increasingly beneficial the areas that are possible to be square . the best methods of this are lines , columns or recur@@ sive second @-@ allocation .
you can design@@ ate the minimal surface for an entry on the menu entry . instead , a R@@ aut@@ en@@ pattern is drawn in the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a sub@@ ordin@@ ate entry .
originally &amp; FS@@ View was originally designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets that was developed for the use of K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .

improved database with considerably more met@@ ad@@ ata , such as &amp; eg ; over the camera or the lens , which can be searched .
like all &amp; K@@ DE ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ came ; an open source project . that means it &apos;s on the support of En@@ dan@@ ese needs . they should therefore notify problems and improvement options .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; tries to report the mel@@ ody of problems or improvement suggestions as easily as possible for them . wherever you use this link , your web browser opens a page in error correction system . all required information are registered here . follow only the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; is a project supported by a community . i.e. , the user and developer will help each other . if you have a regular user of &amp; digi@@ tization ; here , we would like to answer questions about other users of &amp; digi@@ tization ; however , we hope to answer questions about other users . in this mailing list , however , you should be able to be powerful .
you can also visit the digi@@ tization ; homepage , visit news about free versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ came ; to learn .
the best start to take on &amp; digi@@ came ; to participate , registration is in the developer mailing list . instruction to report in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ tization ; .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be provided to you and your photos can be downloaded directly in &amp; digi@@ came ; you can download more than 1000 digital cameras . of course , any medium and any card readers who is supported by your operating system will work together with &amp; digi@@ tization ; work together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by using Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera will then appear as a record drive . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its derivatives . older cameras use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital cameras , which has an constantly increasing number of more than 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol , which has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to host and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need additional driver .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the calcul@@ ator . since photos in general are large files and transmission over the serial port , this connection is now dep@@ rec@@ ated . &amp; digi@@ tization ; supports these cameras and execute the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras will be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support has been designed to read the preview pictures of digi@@ plug . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not be able to see any examples that could possibly be possible or the creation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to &amp; digi@@ came ; is how easy to extend its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug@@ ins interface Project ( manual ) is a joint module structure for &amp; digi@@ tization ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide modules with all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ tization ; by writing a small module to complement one function , as the changes in &amp; digi@@ tization ; even carry out themselves .
to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
the drag and drain of pictures works everywhere : you can lay a picture in a different part of the Al@@ ben@@ evol@@ ms , above the horizontal separ@@ ating line or in another application window . the only limitation is not a picture in keyword , data list or search .
- a file selection allows you to release the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , T@@ IF@@ F , Ro@@ h , movies and audio

&amp; digi@@ came ; represents a lumin@@ table in a separate window available with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image data formats , also rough files , together .
select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L The fluorescent menu . the menu will be added to the illuminated menu and open its windows . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ plug ; main window , you can open the lumin@@ ance fast with L Extras .
you can compare the pictures you want to compare , in the left or right area of the window and place there . if you can synchron@@ ize the photos from the tool@@ bar , select zoo or shooting oper@@ ations on one of the images , then you will compare these images from the same image . so , you can compare the same area of both pictures .
another mode is better suited to view quickly from a series of tool@@ bars , then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the areas of the same . use the left mouse button to display it in the left side . the right next image will be shown in the right side . this makes it easier to work through a series of similar pictures .
of course , normal li@@ tig@@ ation work also work directly from the illumin@@ ants like F4 File Edit ....
all image information from the right side bar of the main windows are available for both th@@ umb@@ nails at the lumin@@ ance . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of any division you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you can detect on the crossed parts of the image , you need to click on and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; hold on . in mode , both pictures will display the same image sector .
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . simply use the zoom control under the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom in and out in the picture . this occurs in both images when you are in the mode preview .
what is a digital report -@@ off from the fashion word ? digital manufacturing management viewed each part of the process after the picture has been taken up to the final output and the permanent storage . each of the photos takes up , sc@@ ans or digital photos will execute a form of digital changes . but most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips to back up your pictures , find , protect and use photos . we look at the procedure for digital photo photographers , use , convert , group@@ ing , ass@@ ure , evaluate , sti@@ cky , sample , wait , and export of image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management adop@@ ts , indicated , categ@@ orized , reli@@ es , searches , transformed , con@@ cre@@ ed and exported contents representing a mon@@ et@@ ric or cultural value . quot ;
met@@ ad@@ ata is defined as data on data . met@@ ad@@ ata is defined according to your definition data , information about or a documentation of other data , which are managed by an application or environment .
I dare to claim that if you don &apos;t have any more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you will not know how many photos you have , then you will definitely not &amp; digi@@ tization ; . the approach to save met@@ ad@@ ata both in a database and in the image files are guaranteed very fast searching and secure archi@@ ving that you can access to other programs , platforms , and formats .
the first thing you do and know before you need something in your system is the structure information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must be organized somehow on your computer . you need to decide if you want to store them on a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; please make sure you need to switch to a bigger drive .
maybe you &apos;ll be happy with this structure . holiday images can be found quickly across your location . if you make enough photos , then you will be sub@@ folder as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . you can then download a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archi@@ ving , work processes , constant supply of pictures to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will not be able to organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the stac@@ king processing easier . split new files .
the separation of original and working files simplified a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image .
we also suggest the met@@ ad@@ ata option in the installation page of met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; digi@@ tization ; this ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forget , then you can also store the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database into the files by selecting the respective point in the menu album .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change that ? to this , &amp; digi@@ tization ; they provide a met@@ ad@@ ata Editor for a number of selected attribute . these are of course the most important .
now start the real work , as you need to refer to any picture of words , labelling and evaluation . of course , you can set all images that need the same attribute and set the value then . you start the best with the rating or sh@@ ear . that makes sense when you can concentrate on the best photos .
let us now continue with keyword , keywords , how to continue using other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ized images from another source with embedded ma@@ ver@@ bi@@ al , then the pictures attached to you can create the pictures attached to the right place . the sub@@ sort of hier@@ archy in the tree is no problem and can easily go through the drag of a sub@@ tree to another . the changed keywords are followed by &amp; digi@@ tization ; updated while the sub@@ trees are persecuted .
the graphic shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata is over@@ cut . this is a very rough representation , as each block of met@@ ad@@ ata in truth consists of many sections . file names and calendar data are characteristics of all images .
enough of the words - the next section refers to inscri@@ ptions , or comments , the third important tool to cat@@ alog@@ ise your met@@ ad@@ ata .
you don &apos;t want to see most of your photos only , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . you are sure to be interested in your photos .
look at this panorama . from the distance it is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look closer , then catch some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you this is the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . Wow ! one starts to dre@@ aming , associations , the historical period of time is present , you may even hear the silence . so the labelling has completely changed your perception of this panoramic view .
for others who consider your photos , the title may be more important than the picture itself to create a story . if you show images , you should tell a story . remember , the key is the meaning of the viewer to help Him to help you understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect , if it &apos;s the strength only with a lab@@ eling for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ tization ; you can also export a lot of text in an internation@@ alised alp@@ habet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) as a sign . you can even exp@@ ose it for a selection of images at the same time . if you are able to exp@@ ose your images into the labels and / or the title of the Web @-@ gallery system . so you don &apos;t have to tell the story for the opening act .
do you remember the time before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet before Goo@@ gle@@ am ? good , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now goes with light speed .
the possibilities of ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alisation are already inn@@ um@@ erable and will be able to recre@@ ate your travels through pictures with geographical data . &amp; digi@@ tization ; also , K@@ ML files can also be able to open your voy@@ ages . you can also export the photos at the reception . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Google Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word @-@ game with copyright and describes the practice of copyright to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms are also valid in all modified versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tell you what information came in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ tization ; when information should be depos@@ ited :
author ( syn@@ onym for writer and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the photographers , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographers , for example , the name of a company or organization should be used . after which this value was saved , it should not be changed . this field does not support sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as a separ@@ ator .
author &apos;s title ( syn@@ onym for the editor ) : linked to the author . examples of this field may be the title of the photographer . examples include : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author &apos;s field , this field has to be filled .
editors ( syn@@ onym for vend@@ ors ) : use the An@@ bi@@ eter@@ feld to identify who this photo . if the photographer has been listed for a news agency like Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here . if the picture is a picture photo , the picture shows the picture here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although these have no protection against mis@@ use . everyone who has no more than basic knowledge in work with calcul@@ ator , can delete or modify . the solution for this problem is digital water@@ marks . for professionals and Hal@@ b professionals this protection is very important to this .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ came ; in the near future , a module for the stac@@ king processing is available .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs on the road or fire . this kind of losses are the same which can also happen to you with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atively . in this section , there are problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which has a data loss .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , you need to buy these cau@@ tious DVDs and you can &apos;t buy more than a few years . of course you can also claim CDs and DVDs in archive quality . there are offers on gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe it lies in your dimension game .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you can use good discs and good recording devices and keep them on the right way . however , the best DVD capture are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you are writing a lot of reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to mistakes , even if you have just written a control mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we needed for form@@ att@@ ing and control of control . despite this massive protection it consists of chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for faulty CDs and DVDs there is a favourable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which seems to work with CDs and DVDs , but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications that damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to win the For@@ mat@@ War against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything was said to CDs and DVDs , of course also for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a not propri@@ ated format . read the media with a description , date &amp; author license and then in a clean , dark dry and before animals protected place . do not forget to copy the data onto the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
dis@@ manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturers include a new disk , but not the data . Google represents a major field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives available : dis@@ agreement study
shortly : Dis@@ ks keep the longest when you are operated in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C . in lower temperature control , the common failure rate increases . some of SM@@ ART provided bugs which are im@@ min@@ ent . these are especially readers and shifting counter . the expected life time is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also have data loss due to a blackout before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be restored without huge problems .
while most electric devices does not account much , it looks different at devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes , these can cause heavy damage . at your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause any loss of data , hard@@ war@@ age , disman@@ t@@ ling mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against electricity points is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is absorbed part of energy storage and the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ bar . remember that not each outlet also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also ensure that it protects the protection against ligh@@ tening , ensuring that it protects the right devices .
as a over@@ voltage of any cable can be used on your computer , you should also ensure that all periph@@ er@@ als can be connected to your system . some manufacturers represent over@@ voltage gri@@ ds which also provide a phone connection for your modem . others provide connectivity options for the co@@ axial cable of cable mode@@ ms and the TV card .
if you have a notebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks , and they also contain the protection for the modem . so you are ideal for the road .
while over@@ voltage protection your system protects your system prior to smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a few seconds can result in the loss of adverse data . it can therefore be useful in an un@@ break@@ able electricity supply .
in addition to protecting over@@ spann@@ ings , these devices can automatically shut down your data and run the system . some models allow them to go back up to the current . if you get a UPS , you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the included software is interesting .
concerns the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and and compare its security at electricity due to this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than 1 euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you think about how well your computer is to be protected . at the end , you should always remember all the cables before you go to holiday .
the Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service . using the right configuration , you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup target for your software . Google shared storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
compared to the hard drives at home , however , very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data via the compar@@ atively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore suitable for a solution to a local data loss of the most important pictures . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a common backup solution . therefore , it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services available on photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB . the professional version provides you more , in case of Flick@@ r dramatically more . for $ 25 a year you get unlimited memory , which should be verified in reality .
from the point of view of data backup , web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically adjusted , thanks to the TCP protocol , and with the large firms use a backup and a partial memory . so , they are safe .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the calcul@@ ator . all transfers are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem support and b@@ tr@@ fs make at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that you don &apos;t tell you that when a transmission error occurred . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ discovered until you have no protection in your computer . nobody seems to have thought about it . the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data way than you have in your computer .
un@@ reliable net parts are a further source of transmission losses , as they generate interest frequencies within the data stream . in normal file systems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes each year .
Z@@ FS by Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle it at low level and is highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solaris and leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched its own initiative with his b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in Alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms that use z@@ fs and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in notebook and 46 % for work@@ top systems . Not@@ ebooks , the share of theft is 50 % .
data loss based on viruses is less widespread than most points . it is currently limited to less damage , such as theft pil@@ es or new@@ install@@ ationen , and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under Linux ; no longer has been sigh@@ ted .
open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS in order to give the common file systems . a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : in@@ correctly , only the speed of the investig@@ ating process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely filed before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 bubble settings from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology is further developed , there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and space characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even though this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the final result is more deterior@@ ating . even DS@@ LR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 Megapixel . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB disk drive you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t make anyone responsible for any data loss . so , you can ass@@ ure your data often following a plan and test this back before you make something dangerous like the re@@ installation of your operating system , exchange plates , or the size change of hard disks .
suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive daily . if , then one day , a lightning strikes you &apos;re lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster suggests local and destroys a lot . forget plane crash : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the whole house .
therefore , Des@@ aster@@ ers always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs to the neighbouring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as mentioned above is a common cause for a data loss despite guard the panic . if you have a backup which is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be secured . it is a moment without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differenti@@ ating : a backup of the files changed since last time has been changed . this creates a complete moment of time to two points : the complete backup and the final differentiation .
incre@@ mental safegu@@ arding : a backup of the files have been changed since last f@@ use . this can restore the original status to any time again . this backup comes with a ver@@ sion@@ ing system on the next with the exception that it is only un@@ checked and not continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that can easily be installed on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions , or other kinds of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have been really changed . this happens when you want to increase safety over ssh .
ass@@ ure important images directly after you saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical medium .
this approach allows you enough time to discover losses and recover . at the same time you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly moment for at least one month and a moment for each month . every other th@@ inner should be done manually after which you have made a complete review .
topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , in the image file saved IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original retained , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ locate images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visual equipment ... , use of the internet .
so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they are interested in your childhood or adolesc@@ ence , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is fore@@ se@@ eable because of your nature , you must consider what is said today . unfortunately , there is no other option than a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself as the current system is backward . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future .
this question should actually be answered by explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system that is important for reading your images , then store it and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and f@@ use technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay in open standards .
scal@@ ability is the professional pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . this is actually always enlarge .
let us assume that you have set the scal@@ ability with you and the area you want to zoom on a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems such as &amp; lin@@ ux ; you can copy this section and put it on a new record :
with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record has been recognized by the system , but do not imp@@ ose it .
&amp; Breakfast ; dd if = / dev / SD@@ B , the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ gt ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS &amp; dollars ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day , no software can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier by year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format which dis@@ appears slowly from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore .
P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard for GIF , but it can save a much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supported X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata for improved color instruction on het@@ ero@@ gene@@ ous platforms , but not as many as T@@ IF@@ F and has a slow compression . this format would we recommend to save your images .
T@@ IF@@ F was widely used as a picture format . T@@ IF@@ F can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with los@@ s@@ less compression sal@@ es@@ g@@ m ( Def@@ late ) . however , it requires very large files . with some cameras , you can save your pictures in this format . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Negative File Format is a licensed @-@ free and open resource format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG is now available on the need for the use of met@@ ad@@ ata . it is now available on the T@@ IF@@ F / EP format and we hope to use the competi@@ tor Canon and Nikon too sometime .
this is probably one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . file information is provided with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; saved the file format for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive in front of your photo , mostly in the raw format , as it stores the met@@ ad@@ ata separately from the image file . however , it can be used to problems with the link between the met@@ ad@@ at@@ end@@ at@@ ei and the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as container and put everything there .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata initiative is an open organization that support for completely compatible online met@@ ad@@ ata standards , which includes a wide range of purposes and modelling , discussions and community work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance efforts to achieve an extensive acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . so long the images are available on the camera system , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert Roh@@ files to D@@ NG and save them in your resource archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for a fine editing you can use external programs . if you get the images again with &amp; digi@@ tization ; edit , then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata . these were cut off by the other programs .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . just export them in Web@@ gal@@ eries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact page , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ tization ; in the section adding a photos to an album , you can add a description as you can already have to add on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you many more advanced settings for import@@ ing pictures to your album keys .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tization ; to use , connect these with the computer , turn the camera on display mode and turn them . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , try to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a he@@ ge@@ ant indicator appears at the bottom . if this is the case , the file name and a symbol for file association settings are displayed . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for file association settings are displayed . if this is the case , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera .
before you can download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to each entry . with the side@@ bars properties and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface you can see the characteristics of a entry or met@@ ad@@ ata .
this dialog shows file properties and photo information to be stored on the camera . a symbol shows that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have any information available .
the rider met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS etc . this information is the same as with the met@@ ad@@ ata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ tization ; or the image processing . note that these met@@ ad@@ ata is not available with some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then download the selection of All . this invites all photos from their camera to an album in &amp; digi@@ tization ; and we would recommend to check if the pictures have been downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the default selection methods of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can download the button and then download chosen . the button is chosen as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , a new option is available to download . these pictures have been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ tization ; in this case , the new pictures have been selected with a star in the preview window . if you select this option , only the new pictures will be downloaded .
if you can download or download the buttons , see a dialogue with which you can select the target album in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums is sorted , displayed in the section My Albums . then select the target album out of the list and press OK .
after choosing the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ tization ; downloads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . you can all delete all of you by using the button Del@@ ete All . if you want to delete it , then you have to delete it first and then delete the reset selection .
please note that there is no possibility that you have deleted from the camera . if you are not deleted from the camera , you should carefully check whether the photos are successfully removed in a &amp; digi@@ tization ; if you want to completely delete it from the camera , if you want to completely delete the camera system , because this is considerably faster .
cameras use as a fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos frequently not particularly meaningful name . the file names are usually removed after you upload photos from different recording studios in the same album . therefore , it can be useful , the date and time when the picture has been made to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirror @-@ based signatures . if you use this last option , you will automatically generate a folder per day .
the options During the transmission opens three additional options , which are carried out before the photos are stored on the plate . if you select this , the corresponding entries from the Ex@@ if information is copied to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct the date and time for all downloaded pictures .
if you want a different file format than the default format , you can use the Pre@@ fix Photo@@ - % Y@@ - % - % d % H : % M : % S option . turn the option date and time . for more adap@@ tations , you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the camera file name , you have the possibility to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in lower@@ case . or in case letters , if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ tization ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name , which the camera is available in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be stored and automatically used when you open the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the time of recording . not all cameras present this information . in the section side bar met@@ ad@@ ata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded into the photo .
the automatic rotation is turned on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , and when you want to turn off this information , use the button and select the automatic rotation and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window .
if your camera has been made available about the date at which the photo was made available , you can use &amp; digi@@ tization ; this information is based on the image data . all pictures with the same date will be loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras offer this information available . in the section side bar met@@ a @-@ data you can read what information your camera could be embedded into the photos .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case you &apos;ll need to switch off directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , you &apos;ll need to install this option . use the button Advanced and choose the option date @-@ based signatures at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from their hosts on your camera is to download . then select High upload dialog &amp; K@@ DE ; in which you can select the files you are uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; K@@ DE ; methods .
after the picture selection is done , ask &amp; digi@@ tization ; you , where the images should be loaded up . a folder box dialog for the camera will be released . select the desired folder and press OK to upload the up@@ loading . the pictures are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Position@@ ing System ) is used as general term in this document . thus , a position is meant to be displayed in long@@ itude and latitude and can be displayed on a map . the identification of the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian GLO@@ NAS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system .
not only for professional photographs , it can be interesting to link an image with a precise ge@@ ographic location . not everyone uses a plane to carto@@ graph@@ s an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architectural office and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you haven &apos;t forgotten where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser which shows the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ tization ; users want to locate the site of the photos , or simply use this aspect , it is well to en@@ rich the position data of a photo .
the question is how does the GPS data get into the picture ? first you should know that ex@@ i@@ v2 has supported many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and map refer@@ encing . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a reproduction of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to the ge@@ ographic sub@@ ordination ( manual ) and last about the manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is no camera , which has an integrated GPS unit . but there are some who work with GPS recei@@ vers together . either as a card module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be saved with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you need to save these data in GP@@ X format as this is the only format supported by the module to ge@@ ographic mapping .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract the data from images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux . do : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you want to know the long@@ itude and latitude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the pre @-@ configured coordinates created by map@@ s.@@ google .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street types . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ came ; try to give you much control over his work processes as possible . in order to access these settings , you need to set up in the Settings menu ; set up on this settings . you can set up between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left side .
action can be selected on a set @-@ up preview or edit image editing . you will therefore display the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ tization ; firm , if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation number and data protection data . these data will automatically be selected to the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected when downloading the camera box . this data is also written to the IP@@ TC fields .
author &apos;s title is a syn@@ onym for the editor : this field should be the number of professional photographers , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description to the car field , this must be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for vend@@ ors : use this field to specify the photo . this must not be the author , as such as Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be registered here . if the picture is a warehouse , then the group or agency will be available here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data into the appropriate IP@@ TC rim . this means that the met@@ ad@@ ata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ tization ; this met@@ ad@@ ata is also available to other programs and can be imported ; imported without lost .
images as embedded dum@@ plings ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments which you can read to your photos , with the images embedded in the pictures . attention : in pictures , which are already sha@@ d@@ led , these can be over@@ written by &amp; digi@@ tization ; over@@ written .
the page settings contains all the options for the information that appear if the mouse indicator ho@@ lies in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ tization ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to determine which file types &amp; digi@@ tization ; preview , you can add the file extension of this list and remove any file extensions . Alb@@ um@@ ord@@ ner , which has no such expan@@ sions , came from &amp; digi@@ tization ; igno@@ res .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Ref@@ res@@ h to the right of each category .
the settings for the lumin@@ ance of &amp; digi@@ tization ; can be set on this page if possible . however , if you then open the lumin@@ ance , these settings will be switched on . some pictures have different sizes and the syn@@ ch@@ rone mode . if you have one , then you can only get on fast computers . if you have one , then you can get a better start results .
by default , image processing is using a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer another color , you can use it here . you can use the tool@@ bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or brigh@@ ter colour in the picture . these colors can be specified here . in the image processing , this picture mode can be switched and switched off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are coded in higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for the immediate explanation .
with the P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this surgery reduces the image quality because P@@ NG requires a loss @-@ free algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . it means a low and 9 high compression .
using the T@@ IF@@ F @-@ files option , you can switch the Def@@ late -@@ compression sal@@ g@@ rope for T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . it does not affect the image quality since the defect is los@@ s@@ less .
with the adjustment of los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files you can save los@@ s@@ less . even if you &apos;ve posted the loss of loss , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported , but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ tization ; the image processing is only one image viewing for photographs . currently , it develops rapidly to one tool to manipulation your photos . with this dialogue , you can change the settings of the image processing .
the default is that all green pixels are equal to ultra@@ violet light . if you use this option , this problem produces a minimal loss of details . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option displays the image a little soft , elim@@ in@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 slide pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
when this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white is not set . standard is to use a fixed color balance , which was photographed on a white map which was photographed in sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD &apos;s SLR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that sub@@ mitting images in four steps get more details in the trot@@ ter . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
the standard it is the sh@@ atter@@ ing , so the parts of your images are burned down , because of the in@@ ability of your camera starts to catch a sharp white in the settings . the setting colors create some unusual results because it shows the res@@ ins in various ros@@ em@@ ones . last@@ ly , you can try to recon@@ struct some parts of the missing information from the res@@ sources .
this is possible because blue pixels in general isn &apos;t so quickly le@@ pers like green and red . &amp; d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to recon@@ struct the missing green and red @-@ percentage from the still non @-@ saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
when you select the option , you get the possibility to set a level . here &apos;s a value of three a compromise and / should be customized for each image individually .
put the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you &apos;ll probably have to set him somewhat higher than the standard 1 . but this can also be done later in the image options of the digi@@ tization ; -@@ image editing will be done . in order to keep the time for humili@@ ation , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a demo site algorithm is a digital picture process , to calculate a complete picture from the partial image data that have many cameras and that provides a Matrix color@@ less pixel . this algorithm is also known as CFA @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; digi@@ came ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide three alternatives to your disposal : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . however , according to some tests it was created . V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm created by D@@ cra@@ w . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color vari@@ ance of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a different color correction , as it is carried out during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions like this to be given . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ came ; information like the colour formations of a colour space in the others are to be translated as closely as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when a picture opens in image processing / color management module with raw files .
browse the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you want to store all of your profiles . &amp; digi@@ tization ; check out these folders during the start .
settings of ICC profiles you have here the opportunity &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . only your images are not managed by the entire screen .
the input profiles should be used to the camera makers and model that included . not all profiles are included in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain any colour mapping or amm@@ amm@@ able error . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma does not have to be found for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you need to carry the paint mapping themselves .
there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your image would be given a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors may be very satisfied as your camera and some colors may be very saturated , instead of leaving on blind algorithm .
for most cameras it is quite obvious what colour profile is for you for what is intended for . unfortunately , there is not a table of cameras and profiles to fit together . this answer is of course un@@ official :
the Canon profiles expands the style for the target : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; K@@ DE ; Image Plu@@ gin Interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; K@@ DE ; image viewing and image processing is supported . by using this interface , &amp; digi@@ tization ; many modules support , which have been written to cooperate with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use and these are then downloaded from &amp; digi@@ tization ; these modules appear as new entries in the main menu and in addition , you will find some also in the context menu of the pre@@ text .
the short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set up in the menu under settings .
for more information ( in English ) over K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get via the K@@ IP@@ I project via htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ in .org or to the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the g@@ ash@@ au settings should be easy to understand . the upper regulator cover the time between the image transi@@ tions , usually are 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other cross fields switch on the met@@ ad@@ ata , respectively , which are displayed at the bottom of the pictures during the display .
the camera features show a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right side there is a button automatic detection , which is trying to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . these are the port settings . currently there are serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage .
at the bottom of the bottom , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active when you have a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera box . you have to set the path here , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / cur@@ sor , specify on your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tization ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , turn it into the display mode .
try out whether &amp; digi@@ tization ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera od@@ ell and port manually . after you have installed your camera , your camera will appear in the menu camera .
you can select any designation for your camera . this is displayed in the menu &apos;s cameras . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all of you here .
with the confirmation dialog for the moving of &gt; images in Mül@@ lei@@ mer , you can set the talk of &amp; digi@@ tization ; in the del@@ eting of a photos in an album , you can find more details about the del@@ eting of a photos and del@@ eting .
the editorial amend@@ ments by the right side bar can be tac@@ kled by &amp; digi@@ tization ; used if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without feedback . otherwise , you need to apply changes to the button changes .
you can also tie the display image of &amp; digi@@ tization ; in case of fast@@ ening , this acceler@@ ates the starting process of &amp; digi@@ tization ; .
the Pre@@ m Start After new photos is forced &amp; digi@@ tised ; the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos ; this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ tization ; if something from the base folder was deleted , &amp; digi@@ tised ; you know if it should delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be found in &amp; digi@@ tization ; used to custom@@ ize the main window to your taste . these settings can choose among settings design from the tool bar . a preview of available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ tization ; you will find more information about this tut@@ orial .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; includes a quick image processing with some base tools . you can use these to view your photos and to correction and improvement . image editing can be launched by a click with the left mouse button of the preview of a picture or the context menu of the My details / Edit menu .
the image processing contains a number of tools to enhance your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ tization ; available so under circumstances no part of your distribution . you will find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the section image processing .
one status line at the lower edge of the window , the file name , current file names , magni@@ fying factor and current picture size .
a menu bar at the top edge , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most commonly needed functions .
the processing functions of image editing change your photos . however , no of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or Save the button Save the tool bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo as soon as you saved the picture .
you might need to make a copy of your image before you change it . you can save you using File Save As .
as long as you can &apos;t stored the photo , you can restore the original picture by using the File Station , or restore the button the button to restore image processing in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change that you have done on the photo since last time .
almost any action of image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting or re@@ inst@@ ate using the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should make the key@@ rings , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z for revers@@ ing and remove C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; if you push the back or restore button in the tool bar , press a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu agreements , all actions in between also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you start the image processing , you can move between the photos on the same album or the same keyword , by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the menu file . if you have any changes on the current photo , you will be asked whether you want to save them .
you can in the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the An@@ si@@ licate menu .
to adjust a picture to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : an extension factor automatically select
view Full Image mode shows the photo in full screen mode . if you don &apos;t want this , you can also change the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t want this , you can call it from the &amp; digi@@ tization ; main window . see the section on setting the image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print the image file , select the Standard &amp; K@@ DE ; print dialog . you can custom@@ ize the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or whole sentences . you just need to select images with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export print assistant . if you follow the assistant , you only need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge , the important information and promotions available for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available , also available in image processing . it is displayed if one of the five riders will be cli@@ cked :
multiple cli@@ ppers , on the same tab , lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear again into the edge .
in the labelling view , you can insert labels with unlimited size or insert . note : the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed to use in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and are arranged by special characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC @-@ sign field in other applications , you should note these restrictions .
after which you comments , use either the button user or switch to the next image , the labelling are then stored .
besides the application button there is a button More . with this , you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or database . however , you can also read the met@@ ad@@ ata into the files . but this is always carried out if you have posted a met@@ ad@@ ata setup , which is always written in the pictures .
the evaluation is an assessment scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sor@@ sions . either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard abbrevi@@ ated C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . the evaluation from the side@@ bar is used to evaluate more photos at the same time , select this from and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC market . encoding follows the scheme in the following table :
the box view shows a search@@ box for filtering the words , the keyword tree and a select box with the previously seen in this &amp; digi@@ tization ; -@@ session appe@@ aled s@@ words .
the sample @-@ tree is adapted dynam@@ ically with the search phrase . you can limit the number of possibilities in search for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful if you have many words .
the input field at the lower end is another relief for inser@@ ting in a picture series . if you have entered various keywords , they are saved for quick access .
keywords may also be set by mark@@ ers of the appropriate check@@ box in the tree . all keywords of a picture are stored in the IP@@ TC field .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword box , this only applies to the highlighted picture and not on the entire selection , If you want a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword keyword .
the page of the keyword is used to change the selection in the main window . usually , the left side bar is used with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , keyword and search interface . if in addition , one or more keyword filters from the right @-@ hand side will be used , only the section quantity of these two are displayed . all of the displayed are available .
you can also drag and drain . suppose you have selected several pictures in the main view . if the keyword already exists , you can simply pull it out of the right side@@ bar and put on the selection . then a dialog appears if you want to set the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window displaying the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword filter is selected on no tablet , which has been selected by C@@ tr@@ l + a , and afterwards there was a keyword from the right keyword on the selection and set up there . a dialogue asks whether this keyword is set to be set .
these search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be turned off on settings .
if you have a rule with and created and determine that it should be one or his , you can easily change this with a double @-@ click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is searched . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , key term , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already placed in the database .
for example , you can specify an advanced search over all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you just need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options then look as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flick@@ r not listed ? the free space station is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save images in full resolution .
this article / tut@@ orial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mostly adapted to &amp; digi@@ tization ; s specific implementation adapted .
the reason why you put a color@@ fully workflow in the colours of your camera or scanners , you can easily reach the colours of your camera or scanners , allowing you to print the colors on your monitor or scanners , or do the colours you print out of your digital dark@@ room .
if the theme comes on color management , everybody wants to know which buttons it needs to be necessary for the results they want . unfortunately , the sense of this tut@@ orials is to provide sufficient background information about color management . additionally , links with deeper information allow you to get your own informal decisions to make you get the desired outcome .
if your picture has passed all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to take care of color management .
they work on a monitor which is cali@@ br@@ ated on the s@@ RGB @-@ colour space . ( see further information below )
your single other editions are by e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ RGB is the de @-@ facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy , why should you then use a different colour space and have to worry about color pig@@ p@@ ng ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see the hu@@ f@@ isen@@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger colour cards , so visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site , and then click Information About RGB Working Spaces .
do I have to add my monitor when I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! if you are working in the RGB @-@ colour space or not , you will need to sign up your monitor . if you are working on s@@ RGB @-@ alli@@ br@@ ates , you must either use your monitor on s@@ RGB @-@ standard , then you &apos;ll need to use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , an appropriate monitor profile , or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , try a further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , compens@@ ate , automatic and contrast wi@@ ping out the menu automatically , automatically check your colors the best . you will have to experiment with these effects , to see which seems best at your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method is sc@@ aled above the whole picture so that the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without changing his color sha@@ ding . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed away .
compens@@ ate : this method adjust the lumin@@ osity of the colours of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of intensity can be used as flat as possible . thus , the same very good results in improving the contrast of a picture , sometimes it produces only garbage . it is a very powerful operation which causes either miracle in a picture or destroyed it .
automatic : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright border tones , and adjusted the rot@@ - , green and blue channels on the entire hist@@ ogram range .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ ance of the RGB values of a picture by post@@ p@@ one the lowest and highest values in the highest possible range and a new ji@@ us@@ ement of all values in between . this is only visible in full @-@ sized images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white @-@ off &amp; digi@@ tization ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white off of a photos .
the white @-@ equal correction is something limited because of a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can do so far from the original picture , areas can occur with over@@ exposed conditions , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , so your possibilities for correction can be better .
this tool is based on a white equivalent bal@@ m that is protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ y@@ m . you start the menu entry colors white off the image processing .
the storage window can be adjusted in size . on the left @-@ hand side are adapted to the original image as well as the preview of the target . if you want to see the original whi@@ p you want , then it &apos;s enough to click on the window window .
the preview of the target photos has a red mar@@ ker . the lumin@@ ance of Pix@@ els below this mark@@ ers are displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
to the right above is a hist@@ ogram displayed that dynam@@ ically is modified as soon as you have a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your score depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and gamma . the shadow alignment allows you to improve or di@@ mming the shadow details of your photos .
An@@ stat with the above @-@ mentioned checks should be used , you should use the colour temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then switch to the image below for calcul@@ ating the color temperature of the white noise . this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically .
additionally , you can set the white off with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposed indi@@ st@@ ator increases the colors if more than a colour channel of pixels are over@@ exposed .. you will display the combined result in the white balance displayed . this is shown in a preview of pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons Save as and Store are exactly this . each setting of the white block that you have set to save you in a text file and re@@ load it later .
the default settings will reset all the filter values again to their standard values and the corresponding white @-@ roll . note that also neutral settings will be given another photo as your original . if you save these changes your original picture changes .
you can adjust the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ung@@ ers per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit coding is better suitable for high quality images . this encoding requires even more disk space , calcul@@ ating time and is designed for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IF@@ F and D@@ NG .
this tool will open the same dialogue such as processing of rough images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour mapping can be carried out by the window of color profiles . a detailed manual for use of color profiles can go to the Rate .
another important tool is available in the menu under colors tone accurate correction . this tool provides a built @-@ in way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously , allowing you to use these for several photos . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner can always use the same mistakes and you will always need the same correc@@ tions . in the manual on the ton@@ ic correction , you will find further information .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find below colors Gra@@ dation in the menu .
the digi@@ tization ; tool colour effects makes you four colour effects , a solar @-@ effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter available .
in times of the chemical processing was Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect of the sensitive phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier of the additional light . this one had the effect that the brigh@@ ter areas dar@@ ker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . the result was a partial negative of the picture . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the Solar@@ isation . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what chemical is possible . another increase is finally produced , a negative picture that doesn &apos;t produce phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar production efficiency . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and that processes ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . he differs from a satur@@ ation that it makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simply , it emb@@ ell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for one on daylight optim@@ ised colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ b . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours at daylight and high contra@@ sts . however , the characteristics make him a film of choice for natural photography . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated colors are also a few photographs of photographs , especially the most popular landscapes , too much .
the ne@@ on filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on light at contra@@ sting . the parameter levels controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repe@@ ats the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . in large pictures the filter can re@@ lie@@ ve the whole CPU for a moment .
digital cameras frequently have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to change the different color aspect of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you can make a picture of bad lighting conditions , you can obtain a good choice for brightness / satur@@ ation . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation requires a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation . all changes you can do in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple leuk@@ emia / contrast / Gamma , the tool is very complicated to improve exposure of exposure . even if the dialogue on this tool is very complicated , you need to explain the range of applications only the range of sli@@ ders . specifically , the three shifts below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three shifts can be cli@@ cked into the image and the left side represents the dark and right side of bright areas .
the easiest way to manage operation is to post@@ p@@ one the control kno@@ cking , and make sure the picture changes .
on the right hand , the original and the preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview is dynamic , updated with the settings of the image , updated on the left @-@ hand side are the following options available .
sc@@ aling : if the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y @-@ axis . for images of a digital camera , linear hist@@ ogram is frequently dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , log@@ arith@@ mic organization is more useful .
three controls : the top for dark tones , middle for bright tones and the lowest for middle tones , frequently called gamma values .
the three colour pin@@ p@@ ettes can be used in the preview of the original picture , to adjust the input values of the shadow , medium and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for an fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to evaluate the output values as well as in the input rate . for example , compression values can be used as a background to create something else in the fore@@ ground .
automatically : with this button , image values are automatically set depending on the image values of the image .
save as and store : using these buttons , the set values in the file system can be stored and later loaded , the Gimp levels format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input values will automatically be adjusted for all shadows , means and sun sets . activate the colour pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the picture of the original picture for Rot@@ - , Green , Blue and L@@ umin@@ ans channels .
the option Transi@@ tional Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you can only see the effect on the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below you see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image ( 2 ) .
on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image is indicated . the preview will be updated dynam@@ ically depending on your settings . on the right side the following options are available :
Modification channel : this select box allows to specify the channel that is modified from the module :
in addition to this box , two symbols are located between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . most of the linear mode is the most useful . for pictures featuring large areas of constant color , the linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , log@@ arith@@ mic mode also helps .
for example , if you move a cu@@ vent@@ eil to the right , i.e. the bright sound , then you can see that these bright tones can be correspon@@ ded with dar@@ ker le@@ bars and the corresponding image pixel can be dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos , you want to see a red markings . if you want to change this mark on the curve you want to change the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and store : with these buttons you can do exactly this . every curve you created can be downloaded and later loaded in the file system . file format is the Gimp &apos;s format .
if you create this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , mid@@ range and sun beds . enable the colour pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original picture to put the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the option over@@ exposed indicator indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you can only see the effect on the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white picture that was corrected within the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and Sonn@@ ent@@ ö@@ ne was used with color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ came ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or modify the colour sha@@ ded parts of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of image processing .
you can select the colour for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first reference as you can correct the channels by adding the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left area of the window is showing you a preview of the window . the original can be viewed on your own rider .
the preview of the target features a red mar@@ ker . if you position this picture appears a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram to display the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are right : controls for red , green and construction permit you to mix this channels . if you want to activate the appropriate colour components , as the channel Mixer is able to generate DAS tools for the creation of great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a colour to a visible smoke comes from the same place in the color channel and what the case is different , you can enhance your Mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion into which you can reduce the colour@@ less first .
the store and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any mixer setting can be saved later and then download . the use file format is the Gimp @-@ channel format format .
the option Transi@@ tional Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you can only see the effect on the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below you can see a picture in the blue channel re @-@ adjusted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is activated . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
black / white @-@ photography was always fascinating about your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a step of working because color pictures can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll@@ ers .
Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super
green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks great , with all scenarios and fits especially well to portraits in the sky . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter .
orange @-@ filtered : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , marine scenes and air photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) orange @-@ filtered .
red filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic kingdom effects and can sim@@ ulate lun@@ atic effects on the time of day . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ ary filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulated a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : generates warm bright and medium tones throughout he adds a little cold into the scra@@ p window . this is very similar to the process of unle@@ aded a pressure and re@@ development in a sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool texture , you can use decorative tex@@ tures on a picture .
by adding a texture to your image regardless of whether it &apos;s a color image or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a screen , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop type portrait of enlarged points or such as a mur@@ al on a wall . the menu entry can be used for it .
relief : post@@ p@@ one of this parameter increases the impression of the depth and three dimensional qualities of texture on the picture .
a paper text @-@ effect has been applied on the picture below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and changed ( 2 ) . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool frame will add a decorative frame to be added to a picture .
the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photos is not easy task . to retain its attention , it is a psychological barrier for the scatter@@ ing eye . this is a psychological barrier for the scatter@@ ing eye . in picture frame , the module can be started from image editing .
type : with this parameter , place the desired cream type for your image . go through the picture with a thin line and a broad frame ( ideal for black @-@ white pictures ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional setting of the ideal is for a pop @-@ up effect and decor@@ atively adding a decorative frame with patterns .
width : the width of the frame is in percent . the range for width is 1 % to 50 % .
the finish setting with the frame is larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio .
using this practical tool , you can insert simple form@@ at@@ ted text into a single image . this also happens in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with your characteristics as you need . the larger the picture , the larger the character set size . to conclusion , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
every setting you chose for your text may be changed until you push the button &quot; OK . &quot; after the picture has been saved , the text part of the image is the image of the image . it cannot be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool sten@@ cil to apply a template on a picture .
the Image Image template can be used in image processing can be used to lay templates about a picture .
for the template , there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . you must , however , use the P@@ NG file format and should be able to add with maximum com@@ pressing ( 9 ) to add template file size . if you want to send your template to the digi@@ tization ; send us an e @-@ mail in english to the &amp; digi@@ tization ; Mail@@ ing list digi@@ came @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you are using this tool to the first time , you &apos;ll need to set your template folder with the button base folder . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder for the sten@@ cil , a tree view is reflected , which reflects the folder structure of the template &apos;s template . the selection of a folder will update the sten@@ cils of the sten@@ cils automatically .
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this kno@@ b virtually enlar@@ ges the picture . it is cent@@ ered around the position of mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ ink : this button shr@@ inks the picture below . if you want to drop the template on the whole picture , you &apos;ll need to reduce the picture accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
post@@ p@@ one : use this button to shift the picture below the template . take the image and place it at the desired position .
OK . use OK if you want to use the template onto your image . the image will then be adapted automatic of the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ came ; sets three different tools for sharp@@ ening . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharp@@ ening is a traditional tool for sharp@@ ening . it is very fast and simple , but generates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
un@@ sharp@@ ness @-@ mask works on the contrast of the edges to look closer to the edges . indeed , it does not work to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it makes it a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gimp and he is protected by Winston Chang .
ref@@ uses is perhaps the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit complicated in its use and has different parameters for adaptation .
photos without focus and most digit@@ alized images require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is precisely that the digi@@ tis@@ ation process needs to be summar@@ ized in a common color . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points can be printed on paper . SLR cameras normally require more and more bear@@ able sharp@@ ening as normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG image , a camera of internal sharp@@ ening has been applied frequently . pictures in the shell format must always be s@@ worn in during processing .
some scanners use a sharp@@ ness already while reading the image . if you dis@@ able this , you get control of your image .
in some situations , you can get useful results by pressing a photo using the sharp@@ ening tool . you can correct the menu entry .
you should do this carefully , because the results are not very natural : sharp@@ ening increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , the usable technique increases Ref@@ ok@@ us@@ se . in general , you can easily fix it via the menu entry . under Ref@@ ok@@ us@@ se you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharp@@ ening .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to fix the image a little soft , is much easier than it to shar@@ pen . use the tool for a soft@@ sign with the menu entry and experiment something with settings . the front window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp m@@ asked is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original picture and the preview can help edit the picture . the window display shows the output of the felt with current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and amount . the default values are often good results and should be tried out . if you generate the un@@ sharp@@ est mask to be strong , noise and impression of gr@@ ats are in the proximity of sharp edges .
the radius represents a how many pixels are affected by the filters . high @-@ resolution images allow bigger radi@@ als . they should therefore shar@@ pen images best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ pe image that is added to the original . thereby , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the swelling value is a fra@@ ction of the maximum RGB @-@ value and to apply differential amount . it can therefore define a minimal differential so for a channel of filters . in this way , areas with a soft change between the tones are exemp@@ t from shar@@ pen and therefore f@@ law errors in faces , heavens and water areas .
this is an example of the in@@ spir@@ ited filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp m@@ asked with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool Ref@@ ok@@ us@@ se re@@ focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool is trying to use a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing quot ; in which it uses a technique called F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ tration . the traditional technique for sharp@@ ening images is usually better results than in@@ sharp m@@ asked . you can start using the menu by ref@@ using colors ref@@ uses in image editing .
in practice , the circular f@@ uss is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ unding . the Gau@@ ß &apos; slide has also depend on the source pix@@ ies that are far from the original qu@@ ell@@ pixel or so far , the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese In@@ verse is influenced by far from the original pixels , which causes un@@ wanted results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular sten@@ tion . it is the most important parameter for use of this module . for most pictures , the default value should be 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is very un@@ sharp , but then should pay attention to Heiligen@@ pons .
correlation : the correlation can reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of module .
noise filter : an increase in space filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values increase from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 only rarely are helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a usable value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value is still missing the picture .
Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . this is most frequently caused by a previously specified fault filter . in most cases , you should not use this value to 0 to increase annoying arti@@ facts . if you need a value un@@ equal zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / o@@ der@@ lo@@ den filter .
mat@@ ri@@ zen@@ ry : this value determines the size of transformation matrix . however , if you choose large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . note that the module is very slow if you choose large values for these parameters . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any ref@@ uses parameters you have set for later and then be loaded .
try all the cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image . the reason for this is that much surg@@ eries changes are not visible immediately , but leave un@@ comfortable arti@@ facts later .
if you read pictures and compressed , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp m@@ asked better results than sharp@@ ening . this could be causing intense m@@ asked to use a larger neighborhood as sharp@@ ening .
theore@@ tically it must always cause arti@@ facts . even under the optimal conditions there is never to remove arti@@ facts . for the Vi@@ enn@@ ese filters you can show that it is the optimal Lin@@ e@@ are filter . practical is the result of the F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters always at least as good as the un@@ sharp@@ ness mask . the F@@ IR Wiener Filter is often better for processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small , un@@ focused image , see :
the original un@@ clear colour image has to be corrected . this picture has been taken with a analog camera . the un@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed result is due to in@@ sufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the methods of sharp@@ ening error correction in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English below this address .
the kno@@ b is put down the sharp@@ ness of the area that was dark@@ ened in order to generate a more natural P@@ up@@ om@@ ile .
the colour content allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tool to remove non @-@ desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the in@@ laid algorithm was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the default settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings for a adjust , you can use the riders smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail production p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of details . a small value leads to a smooth glass above the image . a value of 0.9 should receive details so that no sharp@@ ening is needed . please note that it should always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated to the details of the description of the direction .
alpha depen@@ dency alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ ths evenly throughout all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gra@@ bs or CCD noise will generate a high value of wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts will be best at a value near 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this puts the maximum accuracy factor on all@@ . p then define the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore please use this value to the degree of space in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is necessary , because it is difficult to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repeat : there is usually 1 or 2 of the algorithm . usually enough is 1 or 2 out of the algorithm .
angle width da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is small , should also be chosen as well . be sure to create small angle a long run@@ time . thus , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs .
integral stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de length in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel gl@@ ances and never larger than 2 .
you can use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more to quality you get through the choice of this option is only slight . but it doubles the duration . we therefore recommend it to allow him .
the buttons Save as and loading precisely this . any setting of image errors can her@@ eby be saved in a text file and later loaded again .
image errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still be very long and a high CPU load after themselves . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button .
below , you can see how image errors will be corrected using small arti@@ facts . as you see , there is a pec@@ uli@@ ar black arti@@ fact in the fore@@ ground , that caused by a bad film storage during the journey . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ tis@@ ation &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation was a very powerful tool to reduce shots . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ el .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove st@@ ains and other art@@ ef@@ acts which come from dust or hair on the lens , which can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , so you can read this tut@@ orial in English .
the screen picture above shows a typical scene that was made using a digital camera and high sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ven noise that can be successfully removed using this tool .
in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you will only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can remain at default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) which is used for the filter . large values increase the time that filters per pixel can be used through the image and the colour in it will be smoo@@ ther and adjusted for smaller bugs .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness of sharp@@ ness . if it is increased , smokers are deleted . you might need to re@@ adjust the edges -@@ filter . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer receive and noise or lubric@@ ate again .
edges : controls the edge precision for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the felt . if it is too strong it cannot occur to the whole space or h@@ itting smoking . put it to a value close to the maximum , if you want to remove a weak space or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend you either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by details .
color : controls the colour tolerance of the image . we recommend you to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by details .
gamma : controls the gam@@ mat@@ oler@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase tolerance values of the dark areas , which typically increases stronger , however , the shadow ranges .
absorption : controls the calibration of the phase shift on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smoo@@ ther , noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter appear on the edges . he can remove rob@@ bing and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter on the edges . he can remove smoking and is the recommended method for this .
store and store : these buttons are used exactly for it . all parameters for ro@@ aring reduction you have set to be stored in the file system and later loaded .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and that corrected ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied to the default settings .
sometimes a picture can be cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to fix the image a little soft , is thank@@ fully easier than a painting with the menu entry corrected and experiment with the gl@@ itter . the front window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation to your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; Photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to decrease photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for rest@@ oring gives you the possibility of un@@ wanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to emerge in digital , original or retro@@ active digit@@ alised pictures of digital , original or retro@@ actively digi@@ tised images . the smoo@@ thing takes place along the image con@@ tours and thereby preser@@ ves the content as it does the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and texture . the algorithm uses a different tool , the image error correction , developed . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ con@@ ia and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . it produces some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are un@@ compressed in un@@ compressed image . this setting is to correct these problems .
the buttons Save as and Store are exactly this . every setting of photo restoration can her@@ eby be stored in a text file and later loaded .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still be very long and a high CPU load after themselves . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button .
below , you can reduce how a photo with tie @-@ shaped noise can reduce . the module is applied to a black and white picture that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film @-@ grain on the faces . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and that corrected ( 2 ) .
below , you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures will be reduced to an old colour photo that has been read with a scanner . the original picture can be seen from the sc@@ ann@@ er@@ ical light and phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows you to remove Hot@@ pixel from photos that have been taken with a CCD camera , eight have been used algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi Project that copyright protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are a problem , because there are many cameras with JPEG compression via a built @-@ in supp@@ ression of hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ trac@@ tive method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel .
download this file in the wi@@ zard with the button dark . the tool will detect automatic and bright pixels . these are highlighted in image detail .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you can record the dark directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first described , as described in the previous section , you should download the right dark picture to the correct image . note here that the assistant will notice the last dark and re@@ loads this automatically at the next meeting .
the image area and the preview can help you correct the result . the sample window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all areas of view .
select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the felt . select the best filter method for inter@@ pol@@ ishing this pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ ation : it is determined by an average of the neighbor pixel . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels have a distance of 1 from the pixel block to calculate a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block can be calculated to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn , to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel Cor@@ rection on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original picture has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the correct image is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; Vig@@ net@@ animal correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ um , i.e. , exposed corners to correct one image .
wide @-@ angle lens , particularly those in medium and large photo format , often can &apos;t illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ animal quot ; ( sha@@ dy ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture by sending the light to the sensor there .
but it also has dis@@ advantages . many Center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the Bl@@ en@@ den@@ im , which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lens should also be possible , even with center filter , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , otherwise pressure effects caused by movement .
with the major exposure areas of today &apos;s fil@@ tration and color scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of an Cent@@ er@@ filter , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of an Cent@@ er@@ filter , which is used without this filter . the algorithm is protected by a Cent@@ er@@ filter to a picture . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ o @-@ correction filter , and with three further exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light controls on the point of the wid@@ est density of the Fil@@ ters . the standard density amounts to 2.0 , which allows an optical filter to compens@@ ate for a larger degree of Vig@@ net@@ um , reduce it to compens@@ ate it by a small degree .
Leu@@ ph@@ starch , contrast , and gamma at@@ titudes : the edit of a picture with the Vig@@ net@@ worked correction reduces the lumin@@ ance of pixels . you will need to re@@ adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controllers make you only positive values , as you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a hos@@ tile re@@ proof of the purpose of the target , so let the values for light@@ ness / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing from the menu color Gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ o correction on a picture . the original picture ( 1 ) shows the correct picture in the ver@@ tic@@ es and ( 2 ) the correct image . it was also performed in the picture with this tool .
the digi@@ tization ; lens di@@ stortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lentils on photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric di@@ stortion . colour di@@ stortion can not be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second order deals with the general geomet@@ ric di@@ stortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ v@@ witch form of the image .
the third @-@ grade coefficient has a similar circuit effect , but laughs at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of the fourth quarter corrected the remote corners to the second degree . if you combine these two can be eliminated , virtually all geomet@@ ric di@@ stortion can be eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of the di@@ stortion second degree . with negative values can be corrected t@@ p @-@ shaped di@@ stortion and positive values ho@@ vel @-@ shaped di@@ stortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the di@@ stortion of the fourth order . this value affects more strongly in the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners &apos; parameters are the reverse character of the parameter .
zoom : this is scal@@ zing the image size , and thus leads to a correction of the first degree . negative values increase , while positive the picture shr@@ inks .
bright : this value adjust brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialogue with a preview of Re@@ duc@@ al correction . the values you use for your image will be stored and used for the next start as default values .
the tons or ho@@ ver @-@ shaped correction should be carried out prior to all conc@@ ision or size changes . in case you lead this correction as all the first . if you want to re @-@ cut a picture and then make a ton @-@ shaped correction it would be the effect of the wrong one .
to help you find the best correction , this tool gives you a vertical and horizontal relief line . move it to an important place , such as the sea front or a building screen , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this place . in the connection , you can correct the rolls / ho@@ ver @-@ shaped di@@ stortion with the help of lines .
when you fix an cus@@ hion di@@ stortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can use this with the cutting tool in the menu . you can remove them from the image processing or via the zoom control of this dialog .
for most pictures , the ri@@ ot @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs such as recordings from front , frame and paintings is the perspective so to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that when you keep the camera with the hand you will always have a slight di@@ stortion of perspective .
this is an example of the tons @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ gur@@ u.@@ org website which is re@@ achable in this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( TM ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ ra film , see this URL . this movie has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left @-@ hand side of the window you can select the range for preview . if you post@@ p@@ one the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can regard the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview , you can sim@@ ulate two parameters of fil@@ ming and fil@@ en@@ si@@ tivity ( ISO ) . activ@@ ating the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controls changes the amount of fil@@ ming and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in converting . green meadows will know how snow !
since the filters are mixing on the re@@ produce of infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared profile standard used on a landscape photo of New Zealand . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of au@@ ra in the trot@@ ter .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; filter movie gra@@ bs is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce fil@@ ming on your pictures , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , known to increase the sensitivity of the movies to mix the producers of great silver gra@@ des .
the film designer effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere release from everyday life . if you want to use this special , Gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ ined sight especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , so you must use this filter .
with the regulator , ISO sensitivity can be cali@@ br@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the gran@@ ul@@ arity . the default value is , though often longer values are needed , to ISO @-@ 2400 if you still need more grains , so you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the fil@@ ming effects on a black / white picture . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity is ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; filter oil painting generates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice appearance as an oil painting . natural images and still life are good for this effect .
there are two controls to affect this effect . the top cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . thick brush are better suited for big images . smoo@@ thing the gl@@ itter or , from the other side view , the char@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and that worked with the ( 2 ) . pin @-@ size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and Gl@@ itter 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dient to produce a carbon@@ es@@ k@@ iz@@ ze . it is therefore not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ etch you . this would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator cho@@ oses the pin size and the bottom adjusted the contrast ( straight ) .
this is an example of the carbon filter filter . the original picture ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be improved further by adju@@ sting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; filter engraving shape your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; filter engraving is a quick tool to give your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well in pictures with a simple structure where color does not use the most important in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the picture into a gray , mon@@ umental landscape .
the depth allows to set the contrast of the filtering process . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by cr@@ ushing effects . it uses the copyright algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divi@@ des the image in cells and looks like it is considered by glass @-@ blocks .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wavel@@ ength 1 , the picture is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time for calcul@@ ating and create a high CPU load . you can break these effects any time with the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo in an art work with un@@ sharp@@ ness effects . it uses the copyright algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image along a cre@@ epy lines that go out from a focus . this sim@@ ulates a zo@@ om@@ ous camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often seen in sports photography .
radic@@ als : wi@@ pes the image by turning the pixels around a centre . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
distance sharp@@ ness : om@@ ens the image to create a non @-@ focus camera se . the object seems to be revers@@ ed in the background .
movement @-@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pes the picture by horizontal movements of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera .
atmospheric non@@ sense : wi@@ pes the picture soft in dark and strong in bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and gloss@@ y focus effect ( Hamilton Effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos or add a warm and subtle g@@ low .
Sag@@ itt@@ arius : wi@@ pes the image by random shifting of pixels and sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a arbitr@@ ary moving camera .
intelligent temp@@ o : finds the paint in the image and get it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it through the col@@ t with an average Pix@@ els value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . so you can end this calculation at any time with the button .
the shelves are a nice small tool to make reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es on your image . thereby it gives natural your images a wet look . it uses a protected fashion algorithm .
drop size does not allow the size of dri@@ ps . because the size of the image is not automatically growing with the size of the picture it is often necessary to decrease the size of small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes changes the optical effect of drops on the picture .
you can keep using the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing a range free of shelves . use the Select tool to keep the area , e.g. a face that will remain free to stay . if you then start the filters , the area will remain free of rain drops .
this is an example of the shelf life . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset over a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through sp@@ ies or turning into the right direction . the tools can be found in the menu transform@@ ers , rotating or transform@@ ers .
photo bubbles is definitely one of the most advanced tools in order to enlarge a photo in a minimal loss of image quality .
a picture of shr@@ ink is simple . the big question is , how can you find a picture and keep the details sharply ? how can you find the missing information or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here is a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo is the wrong size you can change it to the desired size with the tool size . choose transformation size change in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is visible below .
the tool for size is changing a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to increase the pixels . if you want a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to blow up .
many educational programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ tization ; uses a further developed approach . the under@@ lying algorithm was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to say the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original size may be retained for the input of the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is necessary , because it is difficult to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
buttons Save as and loading will be used exactly . each entry for photo can be saved as text file and later loaded again .
photo bubbles is very quick at what it does , but it can still last long and a high CPU load after themselves . you can inter@@ rupt the calculation at any time with the button .
you can see below a sample of the picture below by adding a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged view ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard aug@@ mentation .
the cutting of a photo is not only a frequent operation , but also a often under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . in order to cut a picture , you just need to cut the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag the rect@@ angle . you will then see this rect@@ angle while moving the mouse .
if you get rid of the mouse button , the area of the photos will be cut off . by this way you will get a good overview of how your photo would look after the cut . you can create the size of the right @-@ cutting area by pushing onto the corners of the rect@@ angle . just create a new rect@@ angle using the left @-@ hand mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting @-@ section , use the button The cut @-@ button in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries to save or file save in the menu file to save the newly added photo .
in front area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by setting the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio , which you have defined in the dialogue , will be retained .
in the tool After offset ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high @-@ format , the larger value of height and width is assigned to width .
the tool according to aspect ratio uses a 10 aspect ratio . that means it is always equal , regardless of whether you can see cen@@ tim@@ eters , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons around the selection automatic or ver@@ tically cent@@ ered .
in the dialog , you can use the Max . ratio button to cut the range for cutting on the maximum possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation .
the tool according to aspect ratio saves his settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you are able to view the power tool , these settings will be stored as default values in the EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data are re@@ designed to display the cut picture and not the original picture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings of mer@@ ging aid enables assistance to assist you to put your pictures better . these help are : &quot; &quot; &quot;
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third el@@ rule , harmon@@ ic triangles are one way to divide a rect@@ angle in a similar harmon@@ ious triangles .
golden middle : the golden middle is a split by different natural growth patterns , such as spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the pet@@ als of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all kinds of things we feel as beautiful .
the golden partition is the Ir@@ rational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was already used for the old Egyptians and Greeks who designed your temples and py@@ rami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1,@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmon@@ ious .
the golden mid@@ range provides liquid aux@@ ili@@ ary lines for you to put together a picture . these help are listed below :
the Golden spiral will bring good results for your photos . compared to third el@@ rule , the golden spiral produces a liquid line which can follow the eye on the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow along this way .
another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . there should be something that the eye is in the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . this can be simply because without the eye , it will fulfill his task .
the Golden Tri@@ angle also deri@@ ves from the above @-@ mentioned golden spiral . its com@@ missions are the middle points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles are no equivalent triangles . diag@@ on@@ als to this lines can place a static object more dynamic .
if you are using golden triangles inside your framework , you will create an effect of the professional photographer dynamic sy@@ mm@@ etry . try your image focus on one of the inter@@ section and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition you can &apos;t achieve .
the options Horizont@@ al mirror and vertical can be used to mirror harmon@@ ious particles .
with the button color , you can set the color of the aux@@ ili@@ ary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the assistance lines can be invisible . in this way , you can adjust the color of lines your current image .
the free press is a tool to rotate a picture of any angle .
if you do a photo , it &apos;s easy to keep the camera straight ver@@ tically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture where things are rot@@ ated by an angle . you can use this with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing and the tool @-@ free press . select transformation , free rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your image with the sli@@ der angle . the default values are set in degrees . with the button Pre@@ ferences you can set the sli@@ der back to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image will be shown right above .
to help your help , the Free press is available a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse pointing to the two lines . once you can fix it over an important point of the picture , you can adjust it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have shot a picture , you will find un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to repair it is to use the function transform@@ ers from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is the function Automati@@ cally cutting . select one of the following options :
the option Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing sm@@ ooth@@ es the image a bit after the shooting . but note the above warning .
all persistent transform@@ ations are carried out by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares in the corners of your image . the preview will then be calculated automatically . on the right @-@ hand side of the dialog , you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas that are created through transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including empty areas that are created through transformation , in pixels .
corner at the top : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed territory .
corner right above : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper right corner of the transformed territory .
at the bottom of the bottom : shows the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed territory .
corner right below : shows the current angle in degrees on the lower right corner of the transformed territory .
after adju@@ sting the perspective , the image becomes a bit dirty . for a single adaptation this effect is small , but two adjust@@ ments generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after choosing the perspective , you get un@@ joy@@ able tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one possibility to transfer this to the picture with transform@@ ers cut from the image processing .
the tool is used to move a portion of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . this is no rotating , the picture is dist@@ orted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module about transformation shots .
use your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you push pre@@ ferences and ver@@ tically at the same time . if you push pre@@ ferences , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right of the preview area .
to your help , a vertical and horizontal line is displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the switch tool to adjust your image .
after completing the damage , the image becomes a bit sleep@@ y . for a single coating this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two ch@@ ings are caught up twice as much failure and therefore you should avoid this .
after etching , the painting has ind@@ rical tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one possibility to eliminate it , it is the image with transform@@ ers cutting out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write images . the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the type such as these libraries comp@@ ile . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ tization ;
because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , they will always find JPEG and T@@ IF@@ F .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; displays only files in formats which knows . this happens according to file extension and a comparison of these with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension in the list is displayed . you can change this list of file extensions . you can change this list of file extensions . in the section configuration you will find further information .
almost all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or T@@ IF@@ F . some cameras do even allow you to use this format . a detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ tization ; supports both formats .
image compression is the use of data compression techniques on digital images . redund@@ ant information is reduced , in order to save the image data into a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also be los@@ s@@ less if this is stated in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour Very helpful instructions in English . you can convert Roh@@ ing@@ format pictures in JPEG or T@@ IF@@ F with the Roh@@ ing@@ Converter of &amp; digi@@ tization ; in the section configuration you will find further information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ tization ; .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; supports the store of raw photos only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ tization ; here you can see more than 200 raw file formats . all cameras can be shown below on the web site of Dave Coff@@ in . see table below shows a short list of raw material that came from &amp; digi@@ tization ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG format . therefore , this formats and will preview no built @-@ in possibilities for movies or digi@@ tization ; if you click on a film file , &amp; digi@@ tization ; the &amp; K@@ DE ; settings for playback of movies use to start the program to play .

many tools you need the photo editing will be included in &amp; digi@@ tization ; includes her description here .
all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ening , soft@@ ly m@@ asked , noise supp@@ ression , re@@ vit@@ alizing the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture Applic@@ ant quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current picture . to the left of him five buttons allow the comparison of comparison to the comparison area . these modes are :
vertical and without dup@@ lic@@ ate . the left area displays the original and the right shows the filter to the right of the selected fix@@ ture area .
horizontal divide without dup@@ lic@@ ate . the upper section shows the original and the lower indicates the filter to the range below the selected fix@@ ture area .
the left area displays the original and the right to comparison the felt effect .

( 3 ) : the frame to select a preview of the image . you can take this frame with the mouse inside the image and you want to see the picture above . the preview part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left corner , here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all input from the last use of the module will be noted .
the page flyer features the essential information about the selected image and is largely expl@@ aining . it is group@@ ed by the following sections :
photo features : shows a summary of the most important parameters in the shoot of the photos . these data are taken from EX@@ IF data if they are available .
this rider presents an intuitive map tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to move a square . push it C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to move a square . all pictures within this coordinates will be filtered and displayed . this is of course advance your images Geo @-@ data .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is an editor for pallets files . the application can be used to edit paint pal@@ ettes and select colors .
the pallets , which are installed by &amp; K@@ DE ; can be installed either for the whole system or only a user . in the latter case you are in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; K@@ DE ; settings and called user @-@ defined color and Zul@@ u used colors .
in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folder to files .
the cur@@ sor will appear in the p@@ allet view as a line . it can be moved by cli@@ cked on the area next to a color .
it shows the colour next to the colour . the color name is described below . here you can also change the color name .
it can also be used to choose . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor . afterwards , you move the mouse with pressed lin@@ ker mouse button .
if the check@@ box is enabled to add cur@@ sor under the button , the color is inserted either or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode has been selected . this mode can be adjusted by selecting the check@@ box over@@ write under the cur@@ sor cur@@ sor .
a selection that has been created such as in the last section , can be used together with the actions of copying , cutting and insert .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; used the following format for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional colour name , followed by a c@@ rank@@ y sign , if another color follows . if so , there are three numer@@ ical values in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ;

select a color somewhere on the screen and then you &apos;ll find it in the color choice on the left .
&amp; graph@@ er viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ graph@@ s . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . Graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science , and so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; -@@ program to split by graph@@ s ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only few functions .
the &amp; co @-@ viewer ; project set itself to replace these programs through a modern and user @-@ friendly graphic interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; program .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ graph@@ s . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; graphic viewer ; displays Graph@@ ene with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( making a change in the graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; the graph is calculated and in &amp; graphic viewer ; )
menu to open the graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; open or drag the graph@@ s in &amp; graphic viewer ; open in &amp; Kate ; component .
loading of large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 no@@ des and a h@@ ack to represent more than this node )
other required software : &amp; graphic viewer ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ program that requires the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for presentation of the graph@@ s . required are :
the main window shows the opened graph@@ s , every one in their own sub@@ window . at first , if you open &amp; k@@ rat@@ viewer ; without any argument , the tool bar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list of final files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after choosing one or more &amp; dot ; -@@ files selected , the main window looks like in the bottom screenshot :
as you can see , an overview in the corner is shown if the Gra@@ ph is bigger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special buttons , left and right at pres@@ sive &amp; old ; -@@ key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below , you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file has just changed in &amp; graph@@ er ; invited file has been modified by another program , the following window is displayed :
you can choose if the Gra@@ ph is to be re@@ loaded , or whether you want to ignore the change , so that later it will change . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu option at@@ graphic viewer ; set up , see also .
if you open a graph outside of a running &amp; graphic viewer ; -@@ instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; graphic viewer ; -@@ instance , or want to present the instance instance in a sub@@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but change it with the dialog dialog .
during the program start , you can re@@ open all the Graph@@ s of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also define how the graph is to be divided into multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely elected .
if you are using multiple pages , you can choose if the parts of the graph will be fit on this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph .
preview with one on several sites distributed graph@@ s without head@@ line and with another font
the site again gives the opportunity to determine the behavior when a file has changed on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can define a default behavior ( automatically load or ignore the changes ) or the program each time .
the site opening provides the ability to determine the behaviour of &amp; graphic viewer ; determine if a graph will open outside a running session . you can open a default behavior for this case ( or in a window of current session or in a window of current session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the site seating management gives the opportunity to establish the starting behaviour of &amp; graphic viewer ; determine , you can set a default behavior ( open the files of the last session or not ) or determine if you are going to be asked .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization allows GPS coordinates to add to the met@@ ad@@ ata of the image and edit the geographical data in the EX@@ IF keyword in the image and loc@@ alization may be shown in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alisation provides tools available to locate images geograph@@ ically in the spher@@ ical coordin@@ ate system , which is used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itude and latitude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data , you need a GPS track as an XML file in GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ you can download and convert data to you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographic Loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and retri@@ eve the menu . in order to load a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a spin file with GP@@ X file . this file contains of course dates back to the same locations as the pictures of your camera .
if the file is loaded into an automatic cor@@ correlation , the coordinates are displayed in red . GPS sp@@ ur@@ data is recorded in GMT time , and therefore the camera @-@ time must be converted with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone .
the devi@@ ation for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives a top devi@@ ation for the GPS @-@ time and camera measures . the devi@@ ation is covered , among them , the maximum value is 2000 seconds .
if you don &apos;t have a spin data from one place for pictures you can edit the GP@@ X file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have appropriate data . if you know that in reality a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these boundaries here and then cor@@ relate to the button .
the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same place . as the dialog can use the button OK , you only need to use the button OK to set the data on the current photo .
the location can also be found and set up with the displayed card and get si@@ e.@@ Add this always through , until you have achieved a reaching accuracy . the level must always be selected manually . the card can be changed manually between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to hang up the GPS data on the images . here is a small script that the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool uses to have a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums than HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set will en@@ codes UTF @-@ 8 to provide a best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders on which the settings can be adapted . the riders are allowed to select all albums that are exported to HTML . with the three buttons on the right side you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area , the alarm will appear and the text of the HTML page will appear .
the rider &apos;s appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this rider is a link for each image . if you click on a picture , a new page will be displayed in the image . otherwise , the image will appear directly with your standard screen , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed .
the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery can be saved with all your respective images . select a folder from which you write permission . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , EX@@ IF information of your original images are also stored in the new pictures .
using other color depth , you can change the default color depth . naturally , it affects the file size . all other settings are self @-@ expl@@ aining .
the rider curtains allows you to watch some of the settings from the album Reiter for the th@@ umb@@ nails , these are small pictures that are displayed in the gallery .
a Pro@@ gress window displays the user at how far the action is . press disman@@ t@@ ling to break the process .
when the module has created the pages , the window is not automatically closed . you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors occur during the generation . the web browser will automatically start to display the preview of the gallery . press Cl@@ ose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .

the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add a base mapping in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the dialog .
all images will be sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the chosen video format . additionally , you can create a background color for your DVD player . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . you can only use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first you have to packed the images which are to be packed into MPEG g@@ ash@@ au . after that , you can start using the Module MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images selected from you are then named among image files in the portfolio . there you can also change sorting images or the content of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should select the other settings . if you are planning to select the file format , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD . if you are planning the file on a TV , you need to select the corresponding TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should indicate the time in seconds . the speed of the image will be specified , and a low value creates very sudden , a high , very smooth switch changes .
the background color can be set up next . in doubt , you should get it black . in doubt , you can define the name and path of the generated file , you can specify the extension of the MPEG @-@ output file .
if you specify a audio file under the name of the audio file , this will be integrated into the film . after all the settings are adapted to your wishes , you can enjoy the creation of the film . depending on the speed of your computer , you can make sure to drink a coffee and enjoy the g@@ ash@@ au if you are back again .
if a hint appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick packages via the button settings to the right below .
the printing assistant allows you to print several pictures on a sheet of paper . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp . this is e.@@ g : sense to improve or print with the Gimp module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import and convert your images stored in the RA@@ W format in one of three formats JPEG , T@@ IF@@ F or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line utility d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . a original quote from Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not to produce the same results as the software from your camera makers . sometimes you get better results ! .
first select the RA@@ W file , then select the module and start the module . the Ra@@ w @-@ image converter window appears then in mode for a single image . with the kno@@ b you can view the effect of your current settings to the image .
you can now re@@ adjust the values to optimize the Conver@@ ting process . the first option decides whether the camera &apos;s settings will be used for the white balance . if the result is not optimal , you can process the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected , so you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and the conversion result will be immediately and only the extension is adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a low @-@ loss algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
tagged image format , T@@ IF@@ F reserves all the information of your image and uses los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W com@@ pressing .
if you prefer to edit your pictures frequently or later you should not use the JPEG format , as it is only a limited number of operations before it is allowed to deterior@@ ate the image quality . T@@ IF@@ F and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as a storage format , the met@@ ad@@ ata is stored in the RA@@ W file in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start converting the button . if you want to cancel the process again , you can use this process .
the stac@@ king processing mode allows you to convert various images to once . use this mode , so if you are sure , e.g. , by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , you have the opportunity to automatically re@@ write the file automatically . this is helpful if these have been generated in an earlier attempt . however , a preview can not show how far the conversion is progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to com@@ press all images in an album . it uses the program of the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , starting point and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the image .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it uses the Book program from Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce the picture , or enlarge . to this , four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . this option remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to screen size .
no proportional : non @-@ proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
pre@@ press : prepar@@ es the image for the photo pressure . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , Rand@@ size and background colour , is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send selected images with your preferred email program . it is also possible to change the size of the added pictures before . more images can go to the list of some images and lay there .
after you start the module , the pictures window with the photos selected from you are displayed . over the button pictures you can add more photos . for the last selected image , you will see a preview on the right @-@ hand side .
you can also drag images to the picture list and insert the list of images added to the list .
the button photos will remove the selected images from the list of the taken pictures .
once you have selected all pictures you can open the new message @-@ window of your e @-@ mail clients . you just need to add the addresses and the subject . you have to add selected images as an app@@ endi@@ x .
don &apos;t pay attention to many photos at once . most email accounts have limitations for the size of sending emails . it might be a good idea to send multiple emails if you want to send many photos .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and used every time until you change them .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must indicate in the input field below the right path for your installation .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must install the mailing agent on your computer before . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments will be added to the images into a text file and put the mail .
the P@@ NG format under the menu file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo@@ files , but it is best adjusted under los@@ s@@ less formats such as T@@ IF@@ F . you should therefore have P@@ NG while you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG using file format and file the original files in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the original images .
if the process is finished , the window will not be automatically closed that you can view your status messages , looking for errors , but your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically by the end . with the button Cl@@ ose you can sch@@ lie this window .
after starting the module advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , there is a window with questions such as you want your slide show . you can choose between you selected and select any pictures of the album .
the option Open@@ GL @-@ transi@@ tions in the presentation will be enabled very elegant image passes using Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphics card , otherwise the g@@ ash@@ au will be very slow .
the fil@@ en@@ ames option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of images will be displayed in the left corner during the presentation .
the loop loop ensures that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop . you can manually dis@@ rupt it manually with Es@@ c ;
the option pictures acci@@ dentally select that the images are displayed in a random order . so , the pictures are not used in the album .
under delay between the pictures , the temporary distance between the individual images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds are 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . you should be the ligh@@ test before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transi@@ tional effects between which you can choose . random choose one another effect between the pictures .
while the slide show you can access a tool bar at the top left side . move the mouse in this corner to turn on .
with this tool bar you can stop and restart the presentation , jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slide .
at the left bottom of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ames , the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation .

in this area , you can define how the HTML pages are supposed to look like . most import@@ ation possibilities are clear , why this is not particularly received .
at the bottom of the page you can adjust various resolutions for the pictures . this allows those who have to look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 , no pictures download which have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer &apos;s viewer can change the resolution at any time you have set . so he can browse your pictures with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time , browse . if he wants to display a picture larger , he changes to higher resolution .
in this setup area , you place the different ste@@ wards and the URL where your site is stored .
best choose for all your HTML files a base folder and for each subsequent phrase , a new sub@@ folder .
first you need to select the main file in which all your images are stored . this folder will be stored and next time automatically adds . this folder you can select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
once you have created your pictures , you can check whether this really is all for viewer . if you have created a web browser , after the pages has been created , the URL that you define it should be this folder . otherwise the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
in the case that the HTML files are not yet found in the final destination file . so the import function , see , properly , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of current files , but the basic file in which all sub@@ folder are located .
the straight setup possibilities were drawn , all three based on basic folders and UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub@@ folder , whose name you can design@@ ate in the output folder .
in case you are looking for a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you may have to add a HTML page to view the images . however , if you want to add a HTML page to view the images , reception on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work is not even done .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import files into your database with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in it if the images itself is stored in the file , or if it &apos;s only a link to images that you may have all the pictures into the file , so that you can share all the images so independent and that file is so independent . however , the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the menu file ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this is an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file is looking for images that are in a double way . first , the images are not found in the file the .@@ k@@ im file . if you are looking for creating the HTML files , you are only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for Export images is described above , you can exp@@ ose through the &quot; Export File &quot; menu .
the most important option of this dialogue is whether it is to act internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three selection options available to you :
if you can copy Manu@@ ally to the .@@ k@@ in file , you will have to copy the pictures into the same folder as the .@@ k@@ in file .
with the option Automati@@ cally copy the .@@ k@@ in file copy &amp; photo album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to com@@ press the files . if you want this , simply select the export file .
the last option of this page is maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you would not want to limit the pictures in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file is otherwise very large . here you can limit the size by , for example , that each image should be 800 pixels high and wide .
if you import a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file import ... select &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as mentioned in detail .
the assistant to import made of four steps . first you need to select which pictures you want to import , afterwards , in which folder permission are to be copied .
it can be that you are person@@ alised the category of people who are to use a file name ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is required for your database . so , in the third dialogue window , you &apos;ll be imported into the third dialog box , which correspond to the categories of imported file , and which categories these categories correspond in your database .
in the fourth step , you can calculate the categories of imported file using the categories of your current database . an example for this you can see on the picture .
it needs to be simple , pictures to browse and watch : if you see pictures , you often want to view images within different picture sets &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you want to discover images from your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures shown on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will take the various steps from ( 1 ) fixed information about your pictures , via ( 2 ) and see the view and look at ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program for managing your pictures . it has been expanded and today , it is also taking care of your videos . at many places in this manual it is talked about pictures , but frequently this also includes videos .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top file of their images . it is a simple XML file , which you can use with a program of your choice , such as nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or revisions in the CV@@ S , where you want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; remember the folder in which your pictures are stored and used this at future starts . if you want to read another database with pictures , you can start &amp; photo album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
using the menu entry at@@ photo album ; set up ... enter a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; pair photo album ; in the following section of the user guide you will be explained to you the various setup possibilities .
on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can call setup possibilities and options for viewing . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can retri@@ eve a button on the F1 key and click on the desired option .
it was described in you how you can design@@ ate various properties for each image , such as persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups like items , animals or albums .
you can see the dialogue that is used to already exist already existing groups . for each existing group you can choose a let@@ tering and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the dialogue options , you can set up complete members groups , e.g. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a mid@@ day as explained in .
you can select the setup possibilities that you are available for fixed the member groups . with the top selection list you can select the category you want . in the left side box you can configure a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; share its modular system with other graphics applications , such as the digi@@ k@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; K@@ DE ; Image Plu@@ gin Interface . please refer to the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be accessed through the Module modules and will not be described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; pair photo album ; however , they are not part of &amp; pair photo album ; however , most modules have a help site that you can call via the modules themselves .
since the modules are used together with multiple applications , it can be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums can be tested initially with the demo database before using the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or over the menu . do not say , I would not have been warned !
the applications that use modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , so it can be different that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the dis@@ advantage , when you share functions with various applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are not supported in albums . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order is not supported , it sim@@ ulates some modules the order to albums so that you can use the features with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ;
it sim@@ ulates &amp; photo@@ albums ; the current album , which is simply the current opinion , so all images that show you the picture show at the moment .
besides the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album has to be handed over ; the modules also pass a list of albums . here goes on a photo album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , e.g. all people , then each entry of this category is an album for the module .
or it will be the category that you have set up in the installation dialog as a category for virtual albums , so for example , if you have selected the category people , &amp; be a photo album ; so if you have selected persons to view , and the module will continue .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . in addition , select the setup dialog and select modules , which are supposed to be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example for a start screen , once you start &amp; photo album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see the window display at the top of the tool@@ bar . at the moment you don &apos;t find any information about your pictures . in the section we will show you on this window , but now you &apos;ll see an overview of all existing images .
one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see any image with notes . this includes information about the persons appearing on the image , where the picture has been taken separately or for a larger number of images certain notes at the same time . if , for example , it is depicted on all images of Jes@@ per and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
all of these comments can be used for searching and brow@@ ses , as you can read in the section , if you want to see these notes if you are using the built @-@ in viewer .
in see three lists with a text box by selecting persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; pair photo album ; since you will always be able to use information about your images .
the following idea lies the shift of images within the list : if you are depicted a family party and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can find out that the names are shi@@ fted upward , the people can find faster and arrange .
if you prefer to receive a alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click the icon for sorting according to date below .
if you select notes for each image individually , you might need to edit all selected images and have these pictures with notes . simply click on the front and back buttons that can be found under the preview of the picture right above .
if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more comfortable to mark all these pictures and use the menu option on once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . furthermore , San Francisco and Los Angeles lies in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ group . to indicate that it is a super@@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the menu , it is possible to add an existing or new Excel or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also put an entry into a category and place there to sort this entry into a sub@@ category . attention , this assumes you to sort exactly your categories alphabe@@ tically .
you can post@@ p@@ one the individual elements of it , by creating the bodies that form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make your own window as part of the window that you pull it out of the window area .
if you adapted the look of the window to your needs so you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... which allows you to store the current setup and the appearance of the window .
you can also get a frame as well . if you want to display it again later , use the button options ... and then click on the window . see this process in the picture .
if you select the images showing images in the browser , you will receive an overview of preview pictures of the currently selected images , or all pictures if you do not have a filter . for example , you can see the size of th@@ umb@@ nails with the middle mouse button , configure . try it simply .
if you make a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set as background image for your desktop .
when you click on a picture , it will appear in the picture frame . if you don &apos;t have a window with an image viewing , a new display window is created .
you can also delete pictures in the picture preview . simply select the corresponding pictures you want , or select either the remove button or select in the menu Edit menu . now you &apos;ll see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you a solution for this problem . you can also use the pictures stored on the hard disk . of course you need to record the pictures stored in the database Index . in the picture you &apos;ll see the view of &amp; pair photo album ; if not all necessary pictures of the disk can be loaded .
pictures in which the right corner is cut , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the curtains are present , so &amp; quot ; you can see the preview of these pictures . however , you can &apos;t view these pictures with the image viewing .
as you can see this function , you need to copy files from folders and copy it again . if so , you don &apos;t support you to avoid the inser@@ tion of your images . if so , please do not support a major hard drive to save all images .
in the menu pictures you &apos;ll find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to stay a little more privacy , filtering the pictures you would like to be able to open for others and click on the view menu . alternatively , you can also see all images that can see your little sister , please cont@@ acting and choose the menu entry Any@@ thing as you can .
in this case you have set what images should be hidden in the case of your little sister . if you un@@ lock the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry pictures , which you are locked up . if you want to display the images , click on lock .
it is also possible to determine a password which needs to be entered into un@@ locking the pictures . to install this password , just select password change in the menu privacy .
please consider that this picture protection is by no means very safe . for one , all pictures on the hard drive and to the others can read or delete the password in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . this type of password protection is only for those who are familiar with &amp; photo@@ albums ; not very familiar , view to private images .
the reason why you want to describe your images with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours so you can describe it at some point . for this reason &amp; quot album ; with a picture _ and video viewing . you can start from the preview , as described in .
the viewer you can see in the picture . it shows of course the picture , but additional all information you can enter over the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if you want to see the information box on the top part of the picture you want to see and move it differently . you can also configure which information appear and if any information is displayed . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . you can see the context menu below .
some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene here . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have chosen people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have uploaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them and go back by using the keys picture high and picture . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also available from the context menu .
if several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run these as Di@@ asch@@ au . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; invites you to press a new picture after a few seconds . how often it can press a new picture by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus , and stopped and stopped by the keys C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability of the viewer of &amp; pair photo album ; it is used in full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the input button to switch back in full screen mode and back .
if you can use the viewer in the picture you can simply pull out in the picture and zoom out in the mouse . with the Min@@ us button , you can zoom out in the center of the picture . shows as a zoom limit is highlighted and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the dot button , you can reset your zoom , so that the picture is not zo@@ omed . with the uni@@ forms the zo@@ oms set the zo@@ oms so that each pixel is equivalent to a pixel aspect pixels .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ operations that work with videos that you are in and out zoom out with the Plus@@ - and minus key .
with the functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this doesn &apos;t work with videos . you can make comments about the current picture with the menu point notes from the context menu .
if you look at pictures you can see a picture with a person whose name you forgot to set out on the picture . at the moment you can watch the viewing and configuration dialog of the picture to mark these names . however , you will probably prefer to mark the picture and look for more images .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to view the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and see them as good or bad , while you look one after the other .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to paint pictures with features while you can view them . features include the letters A to Z and you can put a feature because you push the corresponding letter . in see a picture where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have placed features on your pictures , you will be able to edit , print or whatever you have selected , so you just have all on one with notes . this is described in detail . afterwards , you can use a module to copy the selected images onto a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview of view . if you can view the categories in DR@@ E preview , then you can simply push the characters for the feature after the image was selected . you can see it here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you to paint your photo album ; painting on the picture .
the painted program is not stored in the image , but in the database . you can easily revers@@ ed you on the way .
in order to see a picture shown on the screen . to switch the painting by &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; select on the image from the context menu . to finish the painting , just press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you have to use the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully contro@@ ll@@ able , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you have read and understood .
in the object tree you can select single objects . then , their features are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire @-@ mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an item already selected , as all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object , or select one menu entry in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
if there are possible positions , the following fol@@ dable menu is displayed , so that you can choose the right position :
with delete either from the menu bar , or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to take these changes . if you have inv@@ alid values , a message with an error message appears . then you can correct the input error and dis@@ card the changes with ab@@ rup@@ tions .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; use user documentation in setting dialog , you can access the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the In@@ dies View .
press on a preview in the Economic View and a small example of the scene is rendered with the selected texture , even if you want a sub@@ ordin@@ ated element , even if you want a sub@@ ordin@@ ated item ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross it locally .
the screen picture shows the control points of the camera . you can pull these control points with the mouse button and thus change the position and direction of the camera .
if a transformation is chosen , the control points and there will be a small cross in the wireless model view . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and turning as well as the position of shifts . you can change the shift through pulling with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a visual stage . you can specify this value relatively to the visible level of the higher level or as absolute value . objects are only displayed if they are selected or their visibility level smaller or equal to the chosen visual stage level of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object features are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need any other arrangement , you can set them any way . you can also store several window orders and easily switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window over or below a view , drag the connection to the upper or lower edge of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the connection to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be an@@ cho@@ red on the right or left side of this view , and extends over the entire height .
if you would like to arrange several views over each other , move the check in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views through clicking on the map counter top in the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . to solve a view from the anchor , drag the touch to the screen or click on the small arrow pointing to the left above @-@ line arrow .
to view a view , click on the small cross in the bottom bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can add additional views in the main window . in the menu view you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are narrow , you can anchor them at any point .
the current window view can store with view window order ... save . it will display a dialog where you can store the window settings under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dering them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dering , this program has to be installed correctly . as this manual is written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 .
to ren@@ dering the current scene , click on the icon Ren@@ dering The symbol Ren@@ ders in the tool bar or select the menu entry scene .
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines image size and quality of ren@@ dering . if you want to ren@@ dering a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you may include any number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview of up to Full images in the highest quality .
if you click on the icon The R@@ ender &apos;s icon or click the R@@ ender Mo@@ di &apos;s menu , the following dialog is open :
every R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes a name to recognize the characteristics of the mode .
in the card size you can enter the width and height of the straight image . if you want to run only a small section of the image , select the section section and give the image section to ren@@ dering in input fields .
in combination with quality , you can select the properties that use &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering . this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user refle@@ ctions lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the User manual for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is framed with only a beam of pixels , various errors can occur . these pictures often have a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or stu@@ ffed effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not shown if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the influence of these errors . generally , images do better look at this property .
if you switch anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and combines &amp; p@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is called super sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling the neighboring pixels with included . the second method is adap@@ tive and adap@@ tive because each pixel is always reli@@ eved and adap@@ tive because of the calculated depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray will pass a beam of pixels . if the difference between the colour values on the adjacent Pix@@ els , both pixels will be calculated using a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you calculate the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated using an extra value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pixel . if the difference is divided between color values the above @-@ level threshold , then the pixel will be checked in 4 sub @-@ pixel , which can be followed individually and set up on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of rob@@ ber@@ y for the beam process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you switch J@@ it@@ tering , the R@@ ays changed to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last attitude for the quality of the Ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; which calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light refle@@ ctions . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this card card , you can adjust whether the alpha @-@ channels are calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent , if the corresponding rays have no object .
opens a new window for viewing the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console issue . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene , select the menu entry file ... and select a file in the dialogue window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full commands of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if , when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialogue window shows a list of all messages .
if you do not support source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object @-@ tree to the Editor to import the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source code for the text file in the Editor . to import objects into the scene , simply mark the source code in the editor and drag it into the object @-@ tree .
copying and insert into &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your Editor you can also insert the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called upon when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene is ren@@ dering . usually this is P@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ P@@ ov@@ ray .
if you click on your own image view , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . here , you will form the path to your document and the version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; look for external files ( for example , al@@ d@@ dd@@ ates ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you are files listed in the folder , you &apos;ll also need to enter the path to these files . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the colour of the frame for the visual field in the camera @-@ view and in the window type label .
you can adjust the object &apos;s cat@@ ching menu in the context menu of the wireless model views . you can adjust the switch separately for shifts , sc@@ aling , and rotating connections .
larger values show an exact wire model and thus a better look for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the ball you can set the detailed level for two directions separately .
when you cross high detail projections for advanced projections , all wire versions are used further , if the camera is an extended projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this feature gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering .
when you cross a wall , a wall is placed behind the objects . the wall is shown in a board pattern from two adjustable colors .
when you cross the ground , a ground below the objects is rendered . the ground is shown in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors .
if you check out cant@@ al@@ ai@@ ds , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method for ren@@ dering the scenes is used . values for depth and swelling can be adjusted . you can find more precise information regarding parameters you will find in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section .
on this page , you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the section window orders , you can create and save window orders .
the combination field standard window arrangement : shows all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used the chosen window arrangement at the start of the program .
the list of window orders displays all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be added to the button and remove a selected arrangement with the button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and should not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views of the chosen window arrangement . new views can be added with the button and remove selected views using the button .
the position of the new window . with new column , you will create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with bottom card you get a box office view together with the previous view and web@@ bing the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you &apos;ve just installed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you would like to follow in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners : a ball at a level .
but you should keep the following war@@ nings carefully before you complain about that you get as a result just a black screen . if you use a 3D program , you should note these important rules :
if you don &apos;t have a camera , no rules can be applied for ren@@ dering as a result , you get a black picture .
if you don &apos;t add light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you &apos;ll get only a black picture .
if you have everything f@@ law@@ lessly installed , see the first pres@@ et window order at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er :
take a little time to get the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar . read the documentation so you can get an appropriate idea what you can expect from this program .
you will have to use these menus and symbols now often , so you should mem@@ ori@@ ze the menus and symbols , and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , first you need to remove all objects from the object tree . mark the scene and then select the menu entry Edit . so you have a scene without objects .
the wire @-@ model view shows how the camera sees all the scene you create . in particular , you notice the scene in the fourth wireless model ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the camera &apos;s view . this shows you the outcome of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on , you can find the content of the view button , where the different parameters of the camera is found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; please find further details .
you do not change anything about the camera &apos;s basic settings , but note that the camera is able to change the camera in the control points , with which you can change the camera &apos;s target point . just click on the left @-@ hand mouse button and drag it to the desired position .
if you push the button application or the ON@@ G@@ AB@@ ET@@ AST@@ E , the wire @-@ model views and the object @-@ tree instantly changes these settings . as a result , they look here the scene from the camera &apos;s view .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you might need to insert an end ( insert final body j@@ ader ) and size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a controversial method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler possibility . you can use an infinite plane than ground :
a good advice : choose the plain in the object @-@ tree , change the name and then press the button application or the ON@@ G@@ AB@@ ET@@ AST@@ E . in the object @-@ tree the new name is displayed immediately .
the wire @-@ model look@@ out now shows the level now , even at the moment only as limited end@@ ental level . if you ren@@ dering the scene , the level extends up to the horizon .
if you can check the object tree exactly , you &apos;ll notice that you can click on the icon + before the object . in this case , you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and displacement . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the ground to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just so you can get some of these parameters . select shifting and set the values as follows :
first choose the floor to set its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a certain sol@@ aches at the moment .
in both cases , a dialogue in which you can select , as the object should be inserted . the pig@@ ment will then change the name in the object tree ( name = ground pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button you see how the pig@@ ment looks now .
of course , the preview of Pig@@ ments only shows a Matt@@ es black material because you have settings for the pig@@ ment . do you always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . also , there are many possibilities , but take the easiest way .
if you don &apos;t see a color on Qu@@ ader and sphere , click on the button and then call the preview window .
the material for the floor is set right now . if you ren@@ dering your image with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color scheme . you need to enter two new attributes . in the color list you need to select two new attributes . then select this entry twice ( you can do this too , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
please select in the object @-@ tree each time and change the colors in the view of the object features :
you should already be able to perform this step , as you should have the fundamental working class of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; already understood . the ball lets you create as easy as the floor :
in the view of the object features , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( don &apos;t forget the B@@ AB@@ ET@@ AST@@ E or button application ) , so the ball has floating over the floor , as you have moved the floor around a unit down down@@ wards .
of course the ren@@ dering is now a strange result : as before , the ball @-@ surface looks like a Matt@@ es black material . put in the following step to a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now as@@ sign a material now . as already at the ground , give the ball a pig@@ ment as color :
select replacement object and change the name for instance in the sphere of pig@@ ment . click the ball &apos;s pig@@ ment , then select one @-@ in and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen photos and click Apply or press the ONE G@@ AB@@ ET@@ AST@@ E .
the at@@ titudes of gloss effect and reflection produce already some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even when metal is not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of it , which offers you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers . hopefully , you have already learned so much you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ jumps is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you have a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ts , the ren@@ dition of hypo@@ the@@ tical radi@@ ance from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera , which ren@@ dering scenes ) is broken and broken through any pixels of light sources in the scene and like atmospheric effects , such as fog . so the scene is processed for pixel .
as you can imagine , you will see without a camera , the camera is your eye to look at the scene . without a light source , you also see nothing , the image is simple black . obviously , any scene does not need to be moved , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual File dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file which you have previously prepared with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open a new model or create a new model , the file will be added to this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you already saved the model , it is saved by the same name . it is a new file , you need to enter a name and a storage place .
rest@@ oring the scene in the last saved version . any changes since the last storage has been dis@@ car@@ ded .
you can only select this menu entry only if you don &apos;t have any stored changes in the scene .
repeat the recently revers@@ ed command . select this menu entry only if you have used editing .
stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog , in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or cover an existing arrangement .
in this menu , you can find options for the setting of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , key short@@ cut and the default behavior .
open a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can use this option pre@@ fix for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; command commands or add new commands .
opens up a dialog to set the tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; commands and remove commands .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is an option to handle rough surfaces , without changing every whi@@ p on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a B@@ ump @-@ Map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geomet@@ ric forms which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these plots . these models will then continue to give them a more realistic appearance .
one texture map is a way to give the surface of an object &apos;s color to pixel @-@ based , using an image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser . the application has a file browser , you can select images for viewing .
images can either be displayed in a private window in size of the image , or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ball show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view with the Click &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or show the return Return .
you can adjust whether any image will appear in your own window , or if all pictures are always to use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , type the first sign of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field is found in the right corner . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file is highlighted . you can rely on the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialogue setting - &amp; ball show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , general and machining and sli@@ deshow , you can set the mode of work &amp; ball show ; in the two other , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the key short@@ let for the respective window can be specified .
if this is selected , then the images will be open in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area with background color is filled , which can be adjusted below . default is not a full screen mode .
if this point activ@@ ates , invites &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you select the current picture . this reduces the delay , if you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for sli@@ deshow .
with this option stores &amp; watch show ; at the end of the last opened folder . at the next start &amp; opening show ; this folder will be displayed in the browser window .
click on the colored beams to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background screen in full screen mode . if in window mode , the window is bigger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ball show ; so set up that only some of the file types are displayed that can represent the program .
this option is enlarged for large pictures the display window on the full screen . this option is switched on as default .
specify whether the slide show is to start with the first image in the folder or the selected image .
the time span between the changes in a slide show . to change the value , you can enter a new value in input field or drag the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds .
the number of re@@ petitions . if this value is set to 0 , the sli@@ deshow is repeated long until it is broken off by the user . in order to change the value , you can use a new value in the input field or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 1 .
change the key short@@ cut for the various business types of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for your browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
shows large symbols for files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short position .
shows small symbols for files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short position .
shows th@@ umb@@ nails for files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short position .
shr@@ inks the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
includes the display window for pictures . &amp; ball show ; is also closed , if no browser window is open .
view the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first sign of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show photo ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ photography based on the &amp; digi@@ came ; image processing . &amp; show@@ case photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ came ; project .
&amp; show@@ case photo ; is a quick image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to watch your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; K@@ DE ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means that the user has its part contributes to at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show photo ; makes it as easy as possible to report mistakes or possible improvements . wherever you use this , your browser doesn &apos;t contain any problems or wishes . if you use this , your browser opens a page to the reports of problems and wishes . all required information is already completed and you can simply follow the instructions to complete your message .
&amp; show photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you have a frequent user of &amp; show photo ; here , we would like to answer questions about other users of &amp; show@@ photo . however , you may soon answer questions about other users . in this mailing list , however , English speaking , you should be powerful .
the best start to join &amp; show photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list . guide to the developers of the developer Mail@@ ing list of &amp; show@@ case photo ; .
&amp; show@@ case photo ; try to give you much control over his work processes as possible . in order to access these settings , you need to show up on these settings ; set up in the menu settings . you can set up between these settings by pressing the symbols on the left side .
in the field of exposure indicators , you can select the colour which is displayed if the under@@ side or over@@ exposed indicator was chosen . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colors with what you are supposed to display , in contrast . lower exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposed a dark colour .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo shows ; possesses a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides you important information and actions to the selected images . you can also see them in the image processing . you can show this in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ inn@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that do not make more fun than images and add up .
&amp; sk@@ inn@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that do not make more than images to scan and add up . &amp; sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can save a dialog for storing or save images immediately in a specified file with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display pictures before the store .
you can check the status of your scanner on the s@@ ane project page by typ@@ ing the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; if this scanner can not be opened , or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog will be opened to selecting the scanner .
users can select the scanner and select OK to open the scanner . exit &amp; sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite . exit .
the further settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not discuss these options .
to insert an image , the user can only start a Pre@@ sch@@ can and then scan the scan range for the final scan . the Pre@@ sch@@ can can start by the preview button .
to improve the picture better , the user can zoom in and out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom that the entire preview can fit into the window .
if the picture has been selected , the final picture can be read with the scan button .
if you select a preview of Save a Pre@@ view in the settings , then the picture is displayed in a preview window as shown below . if Save is pressed , then the image will be saved and lie ? en leads to a demo@@ lition and you will enter into the main window .
the button settings will open the same name before the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can look at the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option has to display a preview of Save a Pre@@ view . if this preview can &apos;t be desired , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the type as &amp; sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; pictures storing the dialog before any one @-@ called image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , you will automatically open the dialog before any re@@ defined file , then you must save Save without a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the pictures are stored in the option Save without a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the pictures are stored after each scan , this folder is used as a standard for the dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for storing images and is beyond the proposed name for the image in the dialog . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric view@@ ix of each time when a picture is stored . the string # # # will be replaced by the figures .
users can adjust the image quality to save image quality . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if Cho@@ ose the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the kno@@ b Help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ in@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button above starts the K@@ DE over @-@ dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and Cl@@ ose can be used to end &amp; sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite .

you may need to set existing multimedia buttons so that it will work as &amp; am@@ arok ; short command . thereby , make your keyboard to &amp; am@@ arok , control centre .
the D@@ COP interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are generally used in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ COP functions from collection , context browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ lists brow@@ sers and scripts . an example call for the D@@ COP function could be &amp; z@@ b ; look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command @-@ line options .
you should enter a feedback if the script can &apos;t be implemented because of a lack of ad@@ diction . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use dialog , so the user know why a script does not run .
results require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE binding for ru@@ by ) from c@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is Re@@ quired for this script . &apos; dialog dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
in folder scripts / template , you will find a lot of template @-@ scripts in many different languages . they can be used as a base for your own scripts or simply use them to expand the required functions . you will quickly find that the writing of scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ COP , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ c and Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which each K@@ DE installation should be taught .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the execute of external programs and commands . usually the function ex@@ ec ( ) is used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be easily accessed . here , an example in Python :
&amp; am@@ arok ; sends messages to all running scripts . to this reason , scripts will be able to monitor their default values and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events if there is no use .
configure the script to display the dialog box . to store and store the setup data each script must take care of each script . when a script is started , Amar@@ c sets the working folder on the folder where all data should be stored .
tra@@ ck@@ Change signals that a new piece will play . the script may now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP features further information on the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the unit length ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume signals a change of volume . the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ men@@ cli@@ cked : subtle menu contains the path to the selected files of play@@ list if a user @-@ defined menu entry can be used . to remove one &apos;s entry on the menu , you can use the d@@ COP function d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script add@@ ress@@ ful men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ men@@ it@@ em@@ title ) to remove a entry . use d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script re@@ mo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ men@@ it@@ em@@ title ) .
before &amp; am@@ arok branches off , or if the user stops a script , send &amp; am@@ arok a script that signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , for example storing files or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that can be compressed using a web@@ server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ Archive ( .@@ tar ) , which can also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which can clearly recognize an archive name such as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; am@@ arok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages containing the Ex@@ tended amar@@ oc@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages right correctly .
the main critic must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining memory modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights :
if your script package is done , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and hang on the Wik@@ i Script &apos;s page of &amp; am@@ arok on your entry to K@@ DE @-@ apps you should use the am@@ arok category ; scripts ) .
&amp; am@@ arok is an audio player for &amp; K@@ DE ; &amp; am@@ arok , has many useful and powerful functions and is still surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; am@@ arok , you can simply pull music simply into the play@@ list instead of having to go through endless menus . maybe you are looking for a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; am@@ arok , you &apos;ll find a piece for collecting brow@@ sers and the quick search will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists brow@@ sers are exactly the right choice for you . and if your decision is still difficult , the dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically select the correct music after certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . this and many other useful functions make Amar@@ c to the most advanced audio player . amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music !
typically , you have to set the folder permission in the base folder of Amar@@ ok sources to comp@@ ile Amar@@ ok and install :
da &amp; am@@ arok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake uses you should have any difficulties when comp@@ ile . if you encounter problems , please report these in the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists .
&amp; am@@ arok shows how most applications can enable or dis@@ able several applications to activate or dis@@ able to activate the configure script . this is a list of available options available .
certain depen@@ dencies need to be met for some of the comp@@ iling options , so that they can be used . details can be found in section system requirements .
activ@@ ates Deb@@ ug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help &amp; am@@ arok on the development of &amp; am@@ arok you should use full .
&amp; am@@ arok is set up without effort to set up the dialog dialog . dialog box has several cart@@ on cards to set up the various functions of &amp; am@@ arok .
player window displaying the player window in addition to play@@ list one or off . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ list window is displayed .
use voting bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; am@@ arok comp@@ ile ; with support for m@@ ood@@ le compiled . the option sh@@ uts the experimental function of the voting bar@@ ometer .
atmospheric shape : this function is only available when &amp; am@@ arok comp@@ ile ; with support for m@@ ood@@ le compiled . thereby , the used color scheme for voting bar@@ ometer is changed .
tuning files in the music files : this function is only available if &amp; am@@ arok is compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ le . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored on location of the corresponding music files . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored in the settings file by &amp; am@@ arok , stored in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ arok / etc / m@@ ood@@ le / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; am@@ arok will be started when a browser needs to be needed .
other browser : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list .
play@@ list when storing the current play@@ list automatically saves &amp; am@@ arok the current play@@ list automatically , if you don &apos;t want to lose the current play@@ list when you don &apos;t want to lose .
relative paths to manually saved play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; am@@ arok on the music files , starting from the location of play@@ list , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is saved .
current pieces in case of play are visible , that the play@@ lists windows open / ab@@ roll@@ ers to keep the current piece always visible in the visible window area .
when changing the context to context @-@ browser , automatically displays the context @-@ browser , once the next piece is played .
the section appearance allows you to custom@@ ize &amp; am@@ arok &apos;s appearance . the section is part of three parts .
in the fon@@ ts section you can use the use of various fon@@ ts in &amp; am@@ arok . you can select typ@@ ef@@ aces for the following area : play@@ lists windows , player window and context browser . press on Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the selection of user @-@ defined color scheme , you have set the Qu@@ al of choice and can design@@ ate your own color scheme . use the color choice for front and background colour .
playback at the start work that &amp; am@@ arok will continue after the program starts with the piece on the spot , with which it has been stopped at the last end .
the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is enabled , a preview of O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click on Select ... to select the desired font for the O@@ SD . the cross @-@ field Shadow causes shadows that the text is displayed in the O@@ SD .
own colors are giving you the option to adjust the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . a click on the color surface opens the dialog for color selection . if enabled colors are not enabled , the pre @-@ set &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ colors will be used .
the input field display text puts the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by typ@@ ing plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below , you will find a list of available space holder and what it mean .
the option is designed for X@@ iner@@ ama user . thus , you can define what the screen should appear on a multi @-@ way monitor environment .
select the audio edition audio output . select an audio driver from the drop down box . some drivers will enable you to activate any further adjustment possibilities in this card card .
the card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folders that is necessary to browse the folders ; in order to browse a file into the collection , mark the check box next to its name . this section also includes reference fields for adju@@ sting , as with the selected folders .
browse sub@@ folder : this causes them to browse &amp; am@@ arok branches as well as their sub@@ folder as well as their sub@@ folder as well .
amend@@ ments : enables &amp; am@@ arok to monitor the selected file on changes ( e.g. if music files will be added or deleted ) , in addition , an incre@@ mental search performed to be able to perform the necessary changes in your collection .
play@@ lists import : causes &amp; am@@ arok , all found play@@ lists in your collection files ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the play@@ lists brow@@ sers .
the part collector database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : allows you to select between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , further facility is necessary in the sub@@ window of MySQL .
the MySQL @-@ setup is used to set up the database for &amp; am@@ arok , using the MySQL database . afterwards , under port : the network port is entered , under which the database is re@@ achable . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use us@@ ername : and password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the map loaded on last@@ .@@ f@@ m addresses the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; am@@ arok ; can transmit the names from played pieces to a load @-@ load server and need to create music recommendations on the current piece .
here , enter your us@@ ername and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have any profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send the pieces and update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; am@@ arok , to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar interpre@@ ters down : after activ@@ ating this setting , &amp; am@@ arok will retri@@ eve a list with similar interpre@@ ters at each time . note : you don &apos;t need a load @-@ profile to use this function .
&amp; am@@ arok is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in summary of the features and gallery with screen photos .
am@@ aro@@ K requires only the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have K@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including those contained in the programs , because &amp; am@@ arok , requires some of them , e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to minim@@ ize K@@ deli@@ bs .
some functions such as the O@@ SD assumes that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will therefore work , but Flu@@ x@@ box will cause trouble . we try to support am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , so we use ket@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they are preparing an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will find a bug in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library for days . you can also delete the file by sending in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ arok file to bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also depend on the broken file that caused the crash . thereafter you can delete the file and leave the collection again .
mostly this is that Tag@@ li@@ b on reading the met@@ a @-@ info@@ s from this file crashing . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer among bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , then try again SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; am@@ arok is something more mature .
make sure all of &amp; am@@ arok used libraries were compiled with the same Compiler Version . if , for example , &amp; am@@ arok , with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.x compiled , this leads to collap@@ sing the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use K@@ DE using art@@ s@@ d then turn off machine . turn off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace of e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically at a crash ) when it is a common crash when it comes to a good back@@ trace , the error will be solved .
this is how many program can write data as UTF @-@ 8 to the met@@ a @-@ info@@ s , but this is not described as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem .

&amp; am@@ arok ; s symbols on the status bar ( random mode / re@@ petition / dynam@@ ical play@@ list ) see in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can easily gr@@ asp the status center under review symbols . please note that in some cases up to three times you have to click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check whether am@@ aro@@ K used the correct Q@@ t library . this can see with ld@@ d &apos;@@ anc@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you possibly need to remove any col@@ li@@ zing Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to adjust the correct version first .
there are some possibilities . most installation problems are easiest by the help of an expert your uni@@ x or Linux distribution . you can also find help in other users or developers . use the Forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # am@@ arok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please fill in there only a mistake if you find something at the correction of an error in am@@ aro@@ K itself .
after the start of &amp; am@@ arok , only an empty play@@ list . how do music pieces come in there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left side and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the play@@ list .
to keep the surface intuitive , the Start window changed into the statistic window . you can find it under ex@@ tras statistics .
the importance of this symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the user rating , while the points will be calculated automatically .
to evaluate cut pieces , the play@@ list must be displayed in the play@@ list and select column columns . click somewhere in the new application column to determine the evaluation for a piece . you can also use the short command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ c is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button to pick your selection and then choose from res@@ etting menu .
drag a play@@ list file with the mouse into the play@@ list and let them fall there , just like you would do it with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - )
in the tool bar of play@@ list , right beside the add @-@ button , the button is play@@ list . click on it .
probably the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the X@@ M@@ MS dev@@ el package and install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el package and install &amp; am@@ arok . look also to lib@@ aries , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . furthermore , you can find it via the menu bar under ex@@ tras Equalizer ....
no . yes , that &apos;s really true ! no ! &amp; am@@ arok , used a back@@ end independent approach , hence the real question is what media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ mm / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we can easily support text and P@@ NG files !
it may be ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which will not be delivered to MP3 decoder ( for pat@@ ent@@ ations reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 K@@ DE , SI@@ MP@@ ET@@ AST@@ E
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; am@@ arok , MP3 &apos;s from : - )
when using the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink driver , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and time equal to audio . this can be achieved through a sound card with hardware bl@@ ender ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or the d@@ mix -@@ module for Al@@ sa ( Software @-@ Mixer ) .
the issue of this command should help you in search of the problem and help a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you might have to specify a different input ( e.g. oss@@ sink ) .
the does &amp; am@@ arok , already . don &apos;t forget that media at first need to be de@@ coded . G@@ stre@@ amer reads only a white noise . G@@ stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded them and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can pass directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use the G@@ Stre@@ amer Driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . enable Sound@@ server with highest priority ( real @-@ time pri@@ ori@@ ity ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see the next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ ou@@ ra@@ pper is set in :
at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause a qu@@ aint playback . read this error report . the enlargement of the sound pu@@ ff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA entry file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either you do not use the Arts Driver , but instead G@@ stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia completely to obtain the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
presumably use the Arts driver . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver was highly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buffer , the less applications react visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the device driver , r@@ ushes &amp; am@@ arok branches off . why ?
after installation of G@@ Stre@@ amer you need to register all components . run G@@ ST register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask at IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( stop am@@ aro@@ K before ! ) : - store ff@@ m@@ peg , comp@@ ile , and install it . then delete G@@ ST register , once as system administrator and once as your normal user . then er@@ ase the module file with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config file and execute G@@ ST register again . please start &amp; am@@ arok .
please report about it in bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ .@@ If you have a full list of suggestions , send them best to our mailing list : am@@ arok @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

basically , this is the previous review with a decl@@ ining value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece has been played , the less influence has every single rating on the overall result .
you can click the evaluation for a piece of yourself by clicking on a split script in the play@@ list window . there you can highlight the evaluation of a piece as well as all other attributes also , by using the right mouse button on the piece and edit : rating or F2 . you can also change the evaluation in the dialog Metad@@ ata .
the developers don &apos;t want you to publish when you are to publish a stable version of am@@ aro@@ K . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan which is not compatible with the short @-@ term plan of am@@ aro@@ K .

if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version available . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crash@@ es and also caused a lot of error reports .
probably , &amp; am@@ arok was installed ; compiled , before you have x@@ ine or g@@ amer installed . therefore , the / configure routine does not compiled this output modules . you need to configure &amp; re@@ use .
now I &apos;ve got &amp; am@@ arok , new installed , but the output modules are still not yet released . and now ?
presumably use a distribution that is installed the development files separated from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary developer files are installed . the same applies to x@@ ine , you must install x@@ ine @-@ dev@@ el . after that you have to re@@ comp@@ ile x@@ ine @-@ dev@@ el .

I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use the second sound card with am@@ aro@@ K ?
set up with at@@ aro@@ K ... audio output , enter the device . typically , for example H@@ W : 0 for the standard sound@@ card and H@@ W : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :

enter the input dialog from x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output is done on the USB @-@ sound@@ card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sampling rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix tool , de@@ activate the check@@ box in sound card .

there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ given ( details of the setup of these follow later ) .
fills your play@@ list with random pieces from your collection and adds further random pieces while playing .
add pieces based on last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( previously : audio cro@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces have already been installed in your play@@ list . you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile with this dynamic play@@ list .
double click on the desired play@@ list , drag them into the play@@ list window , or then click loading . in this way , your current play@@ list will be replaced by the new one . you should save the old play@@ list so under circumstances !
the two pre @-@ set Mo@@ di random mix and play@@ lists mix immediately your play@@ list and you can add at least one piece of yourself from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at the end of the play , therefore your play@@ list will be filled only at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current play@@ list , then turn off the latest dynamic mode : at@@ titudes Dynamic mode . this will be your existing play@@ list as starting point . via the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can also be disabled .
the button New F@@ illing the current play@@ list and adds new pieces accordingly to the dynamic mode . play@@ list will open the dialog to edit the play@@ list and you can change the corresponding settings .
with a right click on a dynamic play@@ list , you have the opportunity to click Edit . as a result , the dialog will open to editing the play@@ list .
enter here any name for the play@@ list . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your play@@ list will grow continuously , the setting for upcoming pieces will be negotiated and they will be played in this play@@ list . if the attitude is active , the already played pieces will be removed among resp@@ ecting the attitude .
played pieces - this is the number of played pieces that should be kept at the beginning of the play@@ list . thus , you can easily see which pieces were recently played .
this is the number of pieces to be added to each played piece for play@@ list . if you set more than 1 , the play@@ list will continuously grow , because only one piece will be played and removed .
the settings on the right side were described already in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can already come from existing play@@ lists or intelligent play@@ lists . if you have several play@@ lists , will add &amp; am@@ arok , random pieces from each of the crossed play@@ lists .
some scripts allow your own settings . you can custom@@ ize the settings by starting the script and then click on set .
you can install new &amp; am@@ arok on the script by installing a select dialog . after installing the script , a new record will be installed directly from the Internet . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . use the button further scripts .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script for longer , you can delete it . select this to delete the script then button .
if you are looking for information about writing own scripts , please look in the writing of scripts .
the dialog box , visu@@ alising plug @-@ ins is used to activate the available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; am@@ arok . the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . to use a plug @-@ in , simply activate the check@@ box next to the name .
this quick installation will show you how to create an audio CD in four steps ; in four steps you can create an audio CD . to complete the steps , you have to have a l@@ ur@@ able installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and a folder with audio files .
this is a dialogue window in which you can select which files you want to burn on CD .
if you would like to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ s@@ ly compressed formats , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is generated , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is created . you can check if an audio CD is created by a los@@ s@@ ly liable format .
in this dialogue window you can do nothing . please wait until the calcul@@ ator completed the burning process .
these quick instructions will show you how to copy the steps with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to complete the steps below , you have to have a l@@ ur@@ able installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have inserted the Qu@@ ell CD into the CD @-@ ROM drive .
to copy a data CD , please select Extras , CD copy ... from the menu . you will now see a dialogue with the possible settings to burn .
after having done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; settings , please press the button Start button . you can now see a dialog box that looks like this or something like this :
in this dialogue window , you can follow the progress of the copy process . once the read of the original file is finished in the image file , you will be asked after an empty CD media to burn the data .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you have to wait until the overall step has achieved 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you have to wait until the overall step has achieved 100 % .
the Q@@ T @-@ Designer U@@ IC can &apos;t find the &amp; K@@ DE ; Wid@@ get modules cannot find this problem . to fix this problem , you can add q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IRS / li@@ b / K@@ DE@@ 3 / plug@@ ins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IRS by your basic folder of &amp; K@@ DE ; ) .
the web site of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org . there , you will receive the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and you can get feedback from the forums and learn more from the forums .
if you wish to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you need at least &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a flow ( also disk @-@ at @-@ Once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; cd@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; cd@@ record ; has all the features that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; therefore choose &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually cho@@ oses &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; for burning of CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o begins ; however , higher quality at burnt audio CDs .
cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the internet such programmes are commonly referred to as ri@@ pper .
OGG Vor@@ bis Library : OGG Vor@@ bis is an entirely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional technology for audio data streaming . OGG Vor@@ bis benefits from Open Source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dec@@ o@@ der@@ - und Encoder modules .
mad : this is a high quality MPEG audio decoder . currently , it supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers layers I , layer II , and layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
lame : a far developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial end@@ co@@ ders . lame will be used by the MP3 en@@ coder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio en@@ coder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Lib@@ sn@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : additional libraries for processing different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg it is possible to de@@ code WMA files to burn them on an audio CD .
SO@@ X : a program that can convert between different audio formats and convert . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio Encoder module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Imag@@ er : a fully equipped car system for editing , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analy@@ zing video CDs and Super @-@ Video CDs .
Nor@@ mali@@ ze : this tool will be useful to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . that can be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and Mp3 collections ; without any effect , the different recording sessions of different albums can lead to the un@@ beautiful effect , which will be re@@ proved different according to the music pieces .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all videos on the CD base folder .
this is a convenient way to re@@ load recently opened projects . the corresponding sub @-@ menu includes a list of these projects . a click on an entry opens the project .
save the current project . if the project has been saved once , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise , after a new fil@@ en@@ ame is required .
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialog store will display , using the file and file name for the project file .
stores all open projects . this is the same as if you would like to save for each single project file .
includes the current project . if a project has changed and not saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what should happen . you can then break between saving and changes . furthermore , you can break the shot and keep the project so open .
includes all open projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for any non @-@ stored project , it should be done as if you were called for each project file .
includes all open projects and finishes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for any non @-@ stored project , what should be done so as if you had called on the file .
if you call this entry into the project , you can select the same effect when you draw the files directly from the upper view into the project view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , they appear so added files in the base folder of the CD .
open the dialog &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the features of the project . the only difference is the extra kno@@ b burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medicine . the burning dialog can only be opened when the project has already contains data .
opens the features dialog for the current project . there are many projects related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them will be described above ( re@@ achable via the right mouse button ) .
this entry is only posted in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful when you use files for a multiple session CD . the data from the previous session will always be involved , even if this function is not used for you to see the files already existing files and folders .
this entry will only appear in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function promp@@ ts &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . this function removes no files from the medium , it just ends the previously imported files .
opens the CD copy dialog . this allows you to create a CD copy to another medium . alternatively , you can also use a copy of a CD which you can then burn even later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
open the DVD copy dialog . this also allows you to create a DVD copy to another medium . alternatively , you can also use only a copy of DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also use only a copy of DVD with the help of copying files , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
open the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete all the content or parts of a CD @-@ RW drive .
open the dialog for form@@ att@@ ing a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) format which will be completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you write the choice between the typ@@ mod@@ i super@@ writing and In@@ kre@@ mental .
burn a previously used CD image . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ iso , * .@@ rescue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which can then be burned immediately through pres@@ sures of the burning buttons . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are not currently supported , you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously er@@ apped DVD image . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ iso file as data source , which can then be burned down by pushing the Burn @-@ button .
a DVD @-@ video can be converted to this dialogue window . this di@@ alogs window will usually appear after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used as well below . it contains information about the output video , encoding settings and even options for changing the size and cut black edges .
displays information about the inserted medium . these information is displayed in the content displayed and include the characteristics of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a little body is displayed at the bottom edge of the window . it contains information on the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view on folder and CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , their content in the contents view is displayed . CD / DVD drives have also displayed a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and un@@ locking of the drive or throw of the media .
the content view turns into a or off . the contents view allows you to select and drag files into the project view . the content view is also the interface for checking audio or video CDs , as long as a drive was selected using a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
turns the header in the projection screen or out . the head@@ bar is a narrow@@ er area , which is only visible if the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it looks just pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views .
this opens a dialogue window for changing the key assign@@ ments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the button settings below .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; set @-@ up assistant . consequently , correct per@@ missions are required to burn CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) .
the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . here you can set up general programming settings . nearly all the features of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialogue is intended for person@@ alise and adju@@ sting the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is how many other &amp; K@@ DE ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , you can use either the command line d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the functional scope , so rather your taste and type of your task is crucial that the associated programs you give .
in this chapter we assume that you can use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then give something like the following in the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions that have all &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ program in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts below are described below .
the Standard D@@ COP interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; displays functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other features to create new projects .

as a result of such a cre@@ at@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method one gets a D@@ COP @-@ reference to the newly generated project : D@@ COP@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can use a reference to the command line by # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project Through using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the installed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Projec@@ t@@ interface , which can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) and cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) , add@@ Ur@@ l ( K@@ URL ur@@ l , Q@@ String ) , add@@ res@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path ) and ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String ) , set@@ e@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String path )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple file , and then insert files into the new folder :

&amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ reader for &amp; K@@ DE ; with it you can easily read audio CD ; s read and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the en@@ coder installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( com@@ p for reading &amp; CD ; file data in WAV files to the hard disk ) and supported by many co@@ ders , which are compatible to MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) . more co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually a per title ) will be compressed into MP@@ 3- or OGG format or even in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , read out &amp; CD ; , it is used by &amp; audi@@ o@@ Creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this has to be done now .
for the second step , lame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other co@@ di@@ erer have already been installed , so it is highly unlikely to comp@@ ile something itself . but if the FLA@@ C does not use it , the installation is not necessary .
which Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er- / file format should be used ? the Chapter Wel@@ ver Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to Ko@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and com@@ pressing factors .
a word for copying of protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the protection , it is not possible to avoid an protected audio CD ; not allowed in any case &amp; audi@@ o@@ Creator ; even not the mechanisms of copy protection . avoid easily the purchase of cop@@ ier audio CD ; s !
while setting up only once ( the setup dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , afterwards the daily use of a &amp; CD can be explained to the hard disk . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the user &apos;s slim approach to which you frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which Ko@@ di@@ erer programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the Free@@ D@@ b from the internet or can work completely without network , where everything is recorded manually .
this is only a brief list of commands given by the main f@@ ender . on the page , for example , you can find more information , such as this program will be used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the program types .
start the CD@@ DB on request of CD data according to the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be locally or online , in the latter case first must first be connected to the internet . )
start reading and - if a en@@ coder is configured in the tab tab , tab - the coding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available en@@ coder , so that the selection can be read with another en@@ coder as the default . it is too aware that the en@@ coder &apos;s en@@ coder settings are configured in the opening dialog .
open the file manager , so that a file format is selected to en@@ code instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
set the dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programming events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
open the main dialog dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; with different card cards ( such as en@@ coder , to set up the en@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ dic@@ als and compression rates , and helps you to choose the right Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
if no audio information is lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats , you lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG likes an easy advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate , the differences are less important because both Ko@@ di@@ ers produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ nt so &apos; free , lame will be delivered free with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ high up to very high sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) but compared with OGG slightly lower quality in lower bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music is heard from one machine or calcul@@ ator @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG @-@ playing equipment is present .
MP3 - If music is to be heard on other devices such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto @-@ stereo devices . today - at the beginning of 2009 , these tools mostly support MP3 format .
a short list with parameters for audio quality and from resulting compression rates for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; lame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This attitude gives good transparency to most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ compression standard &apos; = This attitude is usually offered to most people and most musical pieces of acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and some less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of titles . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR shared stereo , compression rate approx . 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good Gen@@ ug for music of young people , portable devices and auto@@ stere@@ o@@ plants . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo devices .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting is exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you don &apos;t want the absolute top quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information stored manually or automatically fet@@ ched through the program from Free@@ D@@ b via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can be delivered / used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; and the code program to create folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with co @-@ programs there is often a combination of programming settings for the Ko@@ di@@ erer and these parameters here . the manual or help to the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers explain the switch for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; titles to the keyword ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s must be coded with lame , the switch -@@ tt from lame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; added . the result looks as follows : &apos; -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters which can be used ( = buttons in the assistant ) :
this is what Free@@ D@@ b is : a free database , in which persons can read / enter the information , so that all other information can be downloaded instead of yourself in the machine . it is too aware that here it is only spoken of text : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so it cannot be added to the artist nor the music company damage . all information can be given at a bum@@ ble@@ bee through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtu@@ ell .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; you can actively choose a check box ( sending an address ) as those used in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the email address will not be used when retri@@ eving data from the server ( This can only know the programm@@ ers that has reviewed the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; for use of Free@@ D@@ b , the ge@@ ographic will be used to use the next mirror server . this saves bandwidth on the network and resem@@ bles the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of fried eggs for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading one &amp; CD ; . alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the update of the database .
what programs do you use to store pieces from the &amp; CD to save files on my computer ?
there is rum@@ ours that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used , search in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; s. to note , that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed first if this is not done yet .
for storing the selected WAV files , the code can be selected and thus the desired file format can be selected . during the first opening , there are pre @-@ defined entries for &apos; lame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression of audio data ) on the setup of the code . other co@@ ders can be added to this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the lin@@ king lin@@ ux distribution , before the Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used . this is also necessary for the customized Ko@@ di@@ erer . more information on Ko@@ di@@ erer are in the chapter Wel@@ ver Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installation of a code you can receive further information on its switch by entering a command such as lame -@@ help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; Con@@ sole ) . thereby , &apos; lame &apos; will be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
this can have many causes . check out the device code of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and read listen@@ ers on your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . that could give a hint on what is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; read the shell of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step @-@ by @-@ step example . even if you use other settings , you can give this tips how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , all understood , but are somehow still uns@@ ure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to establish those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will launch the program for the first time , setting up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use lame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 .
there must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and lame on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . however , it &apos;s not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , which you can always do the source files .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd insi@@ sts and that you have scre@@ am on it ( eg ; by copying the Kon@@ quer@@ or something into it ) .
the first section is treating the basic set of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; something that is thought to be done just once and
the second section describes the approach to read a &amp; CD which needs to be repeated for each release &amp; CD ;
here we determine the resulting co@@ di@@ erer for compression of music ( lame ) and audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program to use the Free@@ D@@ b to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not be able to read a &amp; CD in any case if the appropriate settings are found .
the device model is handed over to the program program to read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
frequently / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device code of your drive . if this is not working or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a view into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the map of General settings . there is not much to do here . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything will be shown / entered as shown in screenshot .
only if you want to notify in@@ complete information , so that you will be informed of information regarding the generating reference ( tags ) .
the card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and release the &amp; CD ; data automatically displays the internet of a Free@@ D@@ b machine .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected during the reading of the &amp; CD ; to be connected to the internet , so that it can access the Free@@ D@@ b server .
the second selective field is easier , becomes a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately if you are un@@ happy with the database entry and the resulting directory name / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag files , can easily be changed . the directory and file name will be changed and the ID3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; K@@ DE ; Tag@@ ger .
aside from this example , you will continue to note : if you want to enter everything manually , if you want to download the database before . however , it is possible to use Free@@ D@@ b locally within offline mode , but if you need to use Free@@ D@@ b in the offline mode , the two selection fields will have to be selected , at least the first . mode is set up on the card card .
CD@@ DB is for us Free@@ D@@ b . these are at@@ titudes for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from Free@@ D@@ b server via the internet . how does the system know which data will get the CD ? read the section via Free@@ D@@ b . please read the section on Free@@ D@@ b .
mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to side fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look after a mirror server in your clos@@ eness . on this way , the load is distributed between the machines . however , this attitude will work as the first attempt .
both work as equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls operate the protocol 88@@ 80 in standard , there is maybe more luck with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually is open to surf on the Internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to transmit any &amp; CD ; data on Free@@ D@@ b servers . the first check box should be dis@@ able .
simply take the settings from screen photo . ( make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer )
number of simultaneous pieces : ap@@ ologies , is there a reason why more than one at the same time when using only one existing drive ? parallel reading and en@@ code ? the author doesn &apos;t know , hence try .
CD ; after reading the last piece : cross this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined folders for temporary files : when you cross this , it can be useful if only if only space is available on another drive , the box is not enabled , the files will not be specified in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder when you want to make yourself some with the WAV files .
all around as it is on the screen photo . the command is somewhat long , under circumstances a little bit bl@@ ot@@ ted to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , it is an attitude for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi system . the resulting bit rate is approximately 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can be er@@ ased in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the names of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest like in screenshot . some comments for future use outside this example :
the number of en@@ coded WAV files : at a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a wav file simultaneously .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic set of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; it is completed . this configuration is used as default for each output of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change them again .
in this section is described , as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard disk is run . we will create MP3 files . first , a connection to the internet is set up , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from Free@@ D@@ b want to pick up . the process that is described in this section has to be repeated for each release &amp; CD .
since we have a &amp; CD which is not included in Free@@ D@@ b , you will see screen photos a little different than the dates for one &amp; CD ; with successfully released Free@@ D@@ b , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data will be manually able to transfer them out of the Internet . comments are drawn to the differences .
try not the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this is not done yet , now the &amp; CD , into the drive , which was defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in screenshot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD , could be identified and read by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen then you are looking for questions and answers to help or go back to the previous section regarding the default settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD can be picked up successfully by Free@@ D@@ b , all tracks of the pieces are already filled and in addition , the name of the artist and album are displayed .
for the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; gives , a window is displayed , and you can select the database entry , which your opinion is best to your &amp; CD .
if you do not have the check box for the automatic query of Free@@ D@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also solve this manually by selecting the first button on the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have any local database , it will need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 2 : the CD Editor - entry of the CD @-@ data and title of the first piece
specify the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen picture . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Ref@@ eller title &apos; , the rest of the data in an input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist does not have to be entered in an input field &apos; Ref@@ eller Title &apos; , unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ spar@@ ell per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments which are common to all the pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from Free@@ D@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to review the contents of the CD editor , so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album names ( e.g. all words with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any undes@@ i@@ red comments .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary sector . if you set up ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have set out unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; maximum . this option is allowed on the tab card settings ; take a look inside the section &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
Tags : not supported by all co@@ ders or file formats . see in the help of the Ko@@ di@@ erer in order to obtain more information .
just select an entry , obviously with the style of the read CD ; matches . in this example , this is not important since we do not transmit the &amp; CD file . for more information , please go to the site of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD @-@ editor appears again and you can see that the fields for the album is already filled with the given data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece for each case and other information you want .
click on the next line in the main window and process you in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ; entered .
attention : this window doesn &apos;t appear if you have downloaded the data from Free@@ D@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of tool@@ bar . note that the artist and album are displayed above the list .
note that there is a check sign before each line of a piece . just the title indicates the selection of the piece or out . make sure all the pieces are selected , or do the button all pieces select at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
it has been launched by clicking on the button selection of reading the reading process , so this window appears to confirm . OK , and then we will take a look at the window with the essays and track what is going on .
click on the rider orders to switch off on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window for checking orders . the first piece is read on the hard disk . the status of the program will be displayed in the left bottom of the window in the status bar .
this error message appears when you &apos;re trying to work with a Ko@@ di@@ erer , which you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully coded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target file is not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked whether you have writing access to the folder for the temporary files and the target file ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error has occurred right after the end of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece of it , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus , check out and en@@ code in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and en@@ code . the used machine with a am@@ d@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous interpre@@ ting and en@@ code ( of however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out , while another piece is en@@ coded and a third order is en@@ coded in the queu@@ e . after the last piece is coded , a small window with a message appears in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.@@ x or 4.x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the code of your choice .
&amp; &amp; audi@@ o@@ Creator ; today , you can download a default copy of your distribution . if you are familiar with CV@@ S , you can already download a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; a part of an important &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ package . if you read this , you &apos;ve probably done it ...
this section is directed to persons , compiled by source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help like the program can be adjusted if it is running , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls for many different programs , has many variants of settings . best read the step in step example of the settings and settings . it shows screen photos of different input cards and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example .
hello , still read on ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked up after the first start of the program , it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if the program starts up not an audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu .
what is it ? who reads this , probably has started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author can &apos;t reck@@ on this manual . it is thought as the first version of a manual to &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; thought . who is always something useful to add or change it , may it do . at least only after contact with the author . and if you read this , he has to leave this section and is therefore agree with this proposal .
strange when you managed to get the source file from &amp; K@@ DE ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the Mi@@ di@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; K@@ DE ; besides others , he does not have some properties with real @-@ time graphics and karaoke @-@ screen high@@ lighting of texts also , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; K@@ DE ; support . &amp; k@@ mid ; supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound project driver , which is used for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ en@@ zer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphic presentation of the activity of each MIDI channel due to high@@ lighting of the compressed buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag &amp; K@@ DE ; each MIDI file from one &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window on K@@ Mid .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . K@@ Mid automatically determines the procedure used automatically .
seat support . if you finish &amp; K@@ DE ; during the play of a song , K@@ Mid starts again with the same song .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with whose help you can choose the desired song .
you can also drop a file from one &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window in the &amp; k@@ mid ; window , this works also with multiple songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and get the button playing in the tool bar , select the entry matches from the menu ( or insert the space bar ) .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece starts automatically as soon as you push it on the &amp; k@@ mid ; windows . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played in succession . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece plays , you can jump in any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the kno@@ b .
when you find that a song is too fast or too slow down , you can click on the left and right of the speed display and so check the speed speed . to get back the original speed , double @-@ click on the tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the button Pause or the Select of the menu entry in the menu , inter@@ rup@@ ts the playback . do not play the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics event and another both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set up what events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined , so that you have nothing to adjust the entry automatic text code , so you will automatically have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other type .
if you want to set up an event type , choose from the menu settings the entries text events or push @-@ up events . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summar@@ ize . these are played the number after . in this section , how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the Collection Manager . you will find in the menu collection under the point . click here on New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by copying copying and then select the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the changes in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not stored . consider that when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , you have to add a song in the collection manager , where you can add a song . again , the file dialog , with whose help you can choose the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting automatic Add to the collection .
if automatic add to the collection is activated , a piece of opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) is automatically added to the active collection .
if automatic add to the collection is not enabled , when opening a piece the temporary collection is enabled and e@@ ert . this collection will then be added to the opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection , select the collection and select the desired song and then click on removing .
you can select the sequence in which the songs can be played off . if you choose a series from the sub@@ menu setting of the menus , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or select or select random order in the menu , the order is specified .
to play a song , select it in the Collection Manager , or use the select list on the karaoke text .
to jump a song , select the button Next song , the next song from the menu , or press the button arrow on the right .
to jump back a song , select the button , select the previous piece from the menu , or press the button arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the Collection Manager , choose the delete collection and click on the button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , it doesn &apos;t matter , as it is not stored in the leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers who are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events in events which understands the syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ map , conver@@ ts all the events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus allows a trumpet to sound when originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ map because all sound cards are compatible ( including A@@ we and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ maps . so you have to edit the corresponding file from hand ( using your favorite image editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file , which stores all necessary conditions for playing a piece of play .
each section can only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear so often as desired . pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite , however , that each appearance possesses a different text ID ( see below ) .
def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of the Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Another key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D options ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an email , so I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be used for devices which are not General @-@ MIDI compatible .
in this section , as the patches of General MIDI is displayed on your specific keyboard , the general use as follows :
please note that the left side of the equation is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you can &apos;t change the sequence and no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to lay all the sounds that you need to put on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a t@@ elec@@ tor . in addition , you can bear the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
so if now a MIDI file is playing a note with Patch 127 ( the drummer ) , patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch is meant , in which every tone is a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ing instrument ( drum , pel@@ vis , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) , and not the one in which the sound meaning the pitch is the same drum ( as some keyboard boards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to specify how sounds on a certain channel or instrument is depicted .
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as its presence . you have to create 128 entries .
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ boards are used mainly to form frequencies onto the per@@ col@@ t @-@ channel . check out as an example the included key@@ maps .
this section can be used to convert some channels to others . if you want to change the first and second channel , make it easy in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however , these settings are useful for keyboards , which have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel that is displayed on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the corresponding key@@ map must be defined on the front in the file . if you want to change the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , the patch is always used .
the option For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful for example to always use the per@@ k@@ ish patch on the per@@ k@@ ward channel .
the value of Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates , in which relationship of Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events will be converted with the value n , this is used with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then first for@@ warded . the value 40@@ 96 is used , so that no dec@@ imal number is reported in the Map file .
this setting is needed , because GM ensures that a pitch is to play a Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , however , some keyboards with two tones can be found up to one oc@@ tave . to find the correct value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ;
to use a MIDI @-@ map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . you will find in the menu below settings , point MIDI settings
the can@@ al@@ view is a window with a whole range of piano ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ vi@@ als you see which sounds are just played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel there is a select list where you can select an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to display the played sounds . view in the menu settings under the point channel view : settings
the Tempo @-@ LCD display the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . so , for example , find a song be too fast to follow the text , you can slow down . to change the pace , use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about it , like a piece of music , it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; . thereby , the same MIDI file can lead to two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
well , I can &apos;t force anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 @-@ file requires a similar sound quality ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer , you can also modify the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control of everything .
this can happen if you have compiled a binary form ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support comp@@ ile . to remove the problem , you need to download and install the source code ( e.g. from k@@ mid ; &apos; s home )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; Dra@@ g &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; choose all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
enable the default to be automatically added to the collection . otherwise , the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can switch the arrow keys to the left by the Tem@@ po@@ x LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the standard temp@@ o , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have installed on one &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Desktop with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a karaoke file ) or checked ( if I want to play a karaoke file ) or if I want to play a file , just enter the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; windows to change and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
if you want to listen quickly a file , without adding it to a collection , turn off the setting automatic Add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
suppose that you have MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . you only want to play the first file . so , make the setting automatic Add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection contains exactly this a MIDI file .
then dis@@ connect , including B.@@ mid and C.@@ de to create and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you so much ! if I hear this song or see the postcard , I anim@@ ate myself , further on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a ( Spain ) . at the moment I &apos;m not much free time for my Hob@@ bies , but I &apos;m trying to collect a bit of time for my Hob@@ bies , but I &apos;m trying to collect MIDI files , make music and pro@@ positions .
if you want to know where you can download MIDI / karaoke files if you want a question , a mistake or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , please write an e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make me a huge upgrade if you send me a postcard from your home town or a Mi@@ di@@ - / karaoke file from a local group . if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , but if you want to send a MIDI file , you should contact me , as I already have the file .

in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; also can be found on its homepage , which can be found under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can track the development , search information and look at images . you can also find links to pages with other karaoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , as the sound quality depends on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use an FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you have to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ I@@ SU@@ AL . it &apos;s run as if you would have a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear music .
if problems arise , contact one of the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program will be used to play video files from M@@ Player or phon@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD &apos;s , VCD or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished as &amp; K@@ DE ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; K@@ DE ; User Mail@@ ing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is a window with the play@@ list . and finally , there is an information window that is only displayed if information is displayed in it .
it &apos;s possible to en@@ rich the preferred links under the menu Book@@ mark , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category permanent play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hier@@ archi@@ es . if you have an entry , his group and all its sub@@ groups are copied to the current category , and playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; Current News &apos; , Television and Permanent play@@ list may also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . naturally , you can only do that by an editor , but also through the application itself . click on a name of a category cli@@ cks , as well as next editing mode . thanks to the cli@@ cks of a sub@@ group , the XML content is displayed only .
after changing XML files , the menu has to be selected with play@@ list and select either the edit mode , or select another category .
any changes have lost if the edit mode is left or another group is selected without the play@@ list .
as a result of the convenience of the author &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation for starting and end can be disabled through editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c and Change of &#91; general Op@@ tions &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ pler option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can easily be inserted .
it is also possible to activate any other animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will be the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / un@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be an supported XML file .
the animation you don &apos;t need to be short , it will automatically end by opening a different source . however , this would be distur@@ bing at the end of animation , but the user can end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the ads of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; Supp@@ orted ; &amp; lt ; IM@@ G dur = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f = &quot; file : / / / home / c@@ aul@@ ts@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; In the list testing / some examples of S@@ MIL those of &amp; k@@ m@@ player .
there is a rider for the configuration of M@@ Player in configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here , the path can be set up from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bl@@ es@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of M@@ Player .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c . here is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the &apos; sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted into the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the play@@ list XML .
so that the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; can be able to play in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player can be specified as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash .
the con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is used in a consol@@ es application and search for error messages related to the browser &apos;s browser window . if no error occurs , the back@@ end output is called inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console or console from the context menu ) .
so that there is always a pre @-@ given back@@ end for a specific M@@ ime type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c . for example , phon@@ on all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play TV cards either by M@@ Player or X@@ video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be checked , the scanner can be used from configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in k@@ m@@ player , the dialog can be found in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ etz@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . to be selected , the correct coding needs to be found ( e.g. , PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DVB .
as the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ Video ( probably this kind of playing video equipment under Linux ) , this is also supported only on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . this is why the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux must be functioning for the X server . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must therefore be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally they are used by K@@ M@@ Player for the sources different names . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , this d@@ v@@ d@@ nav@@ source , d@@ v@@ d@@ led source , source source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ide , t@@ v@@ scanner , t@@ v@@ source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . when enabled , they start with the play@@ list of play@@ list .
are there indications how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter if I play away from it ( not from the VCD / / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is as a user root after setting the device . it is absolutely secure that / dev / c@@ drom is shown on the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine is starting only slowly , why do I have to check my CPU on their performance every time ?
note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + to create graphical user areas and network support and is used to comp@@ ile &amp; ile ; required .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional tool@@ ing application . under Unix @-@ like systems probably will be back on the package &amp; tex@@ as ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the use &amp; Linux ; distribution list . for installation , the distribution of the distribution or install CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these enable easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are available on the tile ; web site .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; K@@ DE ; , &amp; K@@ DE ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or documentation is desired , the contact should be made via the tile ; web site .
if there are any questions about or when comp@@ iling or ile ; on or if enhanc@@ ements were requested , this should be addressed to the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the use of all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ functions in a graphical interface and within this simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ programs . furthermore , the possibility to complete comp@@ iling and custom@@ ization for this . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and his ways to learn the manual to Kate will be attracted . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can begin directly with reading the chapter works by &amp; Kate ;
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; the right language is : L@@ ay @-@ T@@ ECH . to use the spr@@ ing@@ le &amp; tex ; it is difficult to use a load ( English L@@ ay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Mac@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic setting is that it desc@@ ends from Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
in case there is only a good view to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book for it . around &amp; lat@@ ex ; right , there should be good be@@ ers , such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r .
the same as other identification languages contains &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction to which the most common properties like paper format , page number@@ ing and text background are defined as well as to . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ . { document } and needs to be closed with the command \ \ End { document } .
the quick@@ set @-@ to @-@ rise assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a perfect function for the quick creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the assist@@ ants ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some rooms for the creation of the document . there are also some examples related to the document related settings .
document categories : this is her@@ edit@@ ary : articles ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; report &#93; , article &#91; report &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ v@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , films &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; or custom .
encoding : this is her@@ eby set the character encoding . it should use the character encoding of the system . modern systems increasingly use UTF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best , UTF @-@ 8x should be used ( for correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most frequently used packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; . for the integration , they are only managed only in the cross field .
articles ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . you should always use German text files .
new users are not worried anymore . it is only a brief description of the functions and further information in this section are given in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers - just like other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; k@@ ile ; you should have noticed any mathematical environment . however , it is still noticed by the modest appearance of output file . however , it will save you by high@@ lighting time and tap .
by entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically creates a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the addition line for the command set ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set off in the menu settings ; set up La@@ Te@@ X commands .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; the sub@@ division of the document in the following elements ( part is the most beautiful and sub@@ set element ) :
in view of the document in the structural view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective level .
when creating the own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful . once a DVI ; file &#91; linear file &#93; has been created , jumps &amp; tile ; by a click with the medium mouse button in DVI ; viewer at the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the form@@ at@@ ted document and also other information such as the font type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , converting and to print out DVI ; -@@ Files for various systems and devices .
when using the R@@ Ã ¼ r@@ ts@@ p search , the elements of the DVI ; file with the editor is shortened , and once upon an item in the DVI ; source code , the exact opposite is the exact opposite of it . once upon a section in the lat@@ ex ; source code was cli@@ cked ; it is presented to the corresponding item in DVI ; viewer .
Master document : this function is used for work with multiple files . with a master document the work is simplified using other integrated .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be adjusted for project settings .
quick assembly : the lat@@ ex ; source code will be compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in source code ) .
file custom@@ ization : in this mode , the DVI ; file is mounted on an alarm system , and there is no appeal by &amp; Ok@@ ular@@ line ; after the quick assembly .
in viewing the processing tool bar , the three main selection fields should be developed into the document . the first select box is designed for quick setup of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The ver@@ itable &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection box Fur@@ ther is for entries in articles such as keywords , mer@@ ging , notes , or references . these activities are :
name : this command will create a designation for a section , a picture or different element .
reference : is used for reference to a fixed name ( select a selection box ) .
when using quote , a select list will be displayed with literary entries . for &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x files , this only works if the file is necessary to a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; - the &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; -@@ files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; written by hand .
the last drop down with the name Gr@@ is@@ lan@@ ders is used for the definition of font names . it can be noted the font size for the main text , the joints etc . , etc. are the following font names are available :
at the call of &amp; k@@ ha@@ ste ; there are two choices for completion : 1 . the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document type and legend settings . 2 . the document may be written by reason to hand .
bra@@ ckets on the command \ \ &apos; s class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; defines the font size . if the font is not specified at the beginning , this can also happen in the text .
once the above source code has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code has to be compiled . the easiest way to this is the use of men@@ tioning or of the button quick construction .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; hurry ; for storing the storage automatically .
the comp@@ iling of the document fails , should be searched in the log@@ ging after errors . if using fast , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the log@@ ging should also be respected .
an environment ( English environment ) is a text that is treated differently than the remaining document . for example , a report with the font size is made . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } encour@@ ages the number of let@@ tu@@ bing in the environment - b@@ bing a giant @-@ tu@@ b@@ bing . ( English Hu@@ ge ) .
these are only supported within the environment ( of \ \ ) { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restrictions ( number ) for foreign exchange within one environment .
there are many opportunities to listen to the reading and user friendliness of the document . it can be used for example certain fon@@ ts , fat pressure , cur@@ sive printing , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands are either using the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the surrounding area .
\ \ &apos; { stamps } : this command is available for the course of courses until it is closed with a \ \ &apos; s { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be represented by \ \ &apos; s { word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : creates a quote from the document . the quote begins with \ \ &apos; { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ end { Qu@@ ote } .
after the background to writing the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; file language is presented , now a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for the creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; .
once the wi@@ zard was entered a bit text , a few adjust@@ ments should be performed for better read@@ ability of the document . there should be a quote from a few positions in the fat and cur@@ sive printing and a poem to the application to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , it can be turned back to editor by Editor @-@ View or C@@ tr@@ l E ( internal viewer ) . an external viewer must be closed at an external viewer .
once the DVI @-@ file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into one &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun .
DVI ; is a large file format . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ converting or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file , the same steps as for the preparation of the document ( see ) . in the 7th step - can be printed on DVI , then you can print the document using file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar does not encourage the conversion of DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion can start into the tool@@ bar using the buttons used in the tool .
the forward @-@ looking forward guide the direct jump from the editor to add @-@ to @-@ one position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Bin@@ ders . to do this , only Modern will have to set up c@@ ile settings ...
to select the pre @-@ draft solution , the mouse indicator has to be positioned in one line of the source codes and will be cli@@ cked on pre@@ heat @-@ looking . the jump to the corresponding place in DVI ; viewer is then done .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with one click of the medium mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Document of &amp; k@@ ile ; set up and to the corresponding line . this must be set up &amp; drop ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; set up as text editor ( settings ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
if using high @-@ speed the &amp; DVI @-@ viewer use , an error can be found . if an error occurs , it should be shown in the log file or in the news window .
the log@@ ging file Er@@ kl@@ ash the error source in source code . in the editor , there is always the line in which the error appears . in order to view the f@@ law@@ ed line , the log file has to be cli@@ cked on the log@@ ging , navigating immediately to the error in the log@@ ging line .
once on the corresponding button in the tool bar is cli@@ cked , a window to selecting the template is displayed . the default entries are :
when selecting a document , a document may be written either by reason to new or the assistant to rapid creation of a new document . further information in this section are included in the section .
common users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; c@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new model , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file can be created or a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template by creating a existing document and create a selection of file template from document .
when creating a new document using file New , some character strings will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings ... settings will be adjusted .
when creating the own template , it is necessary to know what character strings be replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string will be replaced by entering document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ \ &apos; s $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { items } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the assistant and the associated entry into the editor . once the document has been created this way , the following steps were accomplished :
when creating a new document , the own template can be selected instead of standard sizes .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files created . will be a simple way to create a template , should be searched for one in the internet and searched the steps below .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; used as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; ) . many settings for &amp; Kate ; can be made out directly in the menus .
to learn more about Kate &apos;s &amp; Kate ; and to learn his friends , the manual should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can also be downloaded directly with reading the chapter works by &amp; Kate ;
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ command reference , which can be called upon the Men@@ us Help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with penet@@ rated C@@ tr@@ l key to increase the &amp; tex ; -@@ word . that means that in this way , click on the \ \ par \ \ associated ski@@ p \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ .
when pulling the text with penet@@ rated lin@@ ker mouse button , the fully @-@ balanced text is automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with penet@@ rated switch , parts of the source text in the Edi@@ tor@@ window will be radi@@ ated .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the ability to browse these different types of source codes and empha@@ size . for example , the lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from normal text and also the mathematical forms are highlighted by another color .
a lot of assist@@ ants in the text marks . it is an own type of reading marks within the text . the menu entry , or the corresponding key stamp , is empha@@ sized that it is also highlighted in the first entry of a drawing automatically .
the processor is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate ; already excellent breakfasts have been added ; &amp; lat@@ ex ; important features for the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source codes for their selection . under processing tools , the following commands are included to the text selection :
displays a complete paragraph ( group of rows , which included on both sides ) . this extended meaning will not include a text with continuous lines , i.e. tables , lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of source codes . the only preventive thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the waste is separated by two blank lines .
the word appears below the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended importance , as this command also contains &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a mixed star ( * ) at the end .
for sale of a part of the document can be removed from this first and off the button . &amp; Kate ; offers the key@@ chain C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers its own commands for a faster speed . under editing , the following commands are included in the text of the text :
removes a complete unit . definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description to edit output .
it was already clear that environments can play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; k@@ ile ; for more commands in an active environment for a perfect simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor will be placed directly before the command to create the surrounding area .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor will be placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is before or within the instruction \ \ begin } , it will jump to the end of the surrounding area ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a lot of soft@@ ened ambient commands , the view can be lost rapidly . this command will close the last @-@ made environment , so that the ambient structure is not dist@@ orted .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by stap@@ les { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond to the processor .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor will be placed directly in front of the welded bracket .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor will be placed directly behind the soft cl@@ amp .
if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the soft cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; group # is located at the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
during the typ@@ ing of many welded groups in bra@@ ckets , this command can be lost rapidly . this command will close the last @-@ made group , so the W@@ ax@@ ed structure of the &amp; tex ; groups are not divided .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple touch characters used to be used . for the purpose of this purpose is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign is used for two simple touch characters . also available for the demonstration of the beginning . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and covers two pre@@ valent test characters for lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic one of the double initial sign can be set up under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X and be eliminated .
there are also specific settings ( e.g. n@@ st or French ) and thus can be used by German or French specialties . there are also many more languages available .
when you can switch from Shift ; ON@@ G@@ AB@@ ET@@ AST@@ E for a smart line breaks . if the current position is located within a lists -@@ environment ( e.g. sk@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , it has a line breaks , but at the same time the command \ \ item .
in a tables area close t &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ \ &apos; s line with an enclosed line break off .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to empha@@ size vo@@ icing &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be set up under settings ; set up La@@ Te@@ X .
some users can arrange the columns in tables environments , and all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; k@@ ile ; try to be able to encourage you . although this post@@ ulator is not the addition of the table , it is possible to add up &amp; ile ; some intermediate space for the columns position of the current tab@@ ators .
although &amp; Kate ; already has a good source code full of code , it has been added to &amp; k@@ ile ; for specific commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , three according to need and the other two are implemented for the automatic transfer . all these modes are set up for different work@@ stations under Settings ... to set up ...

when the switch is checked , the last letter of entry will be removed and understand@@ able , ER@@ T thus becomes the complete list . on the other hand , the list may also reduce the list by entering a further letters .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are comp@@ lied with selection of a command . alternatively , jump stamps are possible , so that a simple jump to these positions is possible by using the ligh@@ test stamp marks , and the seas@@ oned parameters can be folded .

the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; possibly have little to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows you to benefit from the additional functionality and do not wait until somebody is used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements . more
to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we start with the menu plug @-@ in . it will open the following dialog :
this dialogue enables you to manage all the plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ ELE@@ MENT :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins is used without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path leads to the search of the plug @-@ ins .
often working on a project several persons in a type of hier@@ arch@@ ical relation to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the speci@@ fying of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties @-@ Dialog box .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nickname of the user and serves to clear identification .
a member may have several roles in the project , such as team leader as well as sub @-@ project leader .
the user can search for yourself from the list of te@@ amm@@ ates , who it is . this happens by exam@@ ining the team member from the list and the button S@@ etze as presses . the currently selected member ( your identification ) appears bold after which you are : text .
nickname and attitude of their own identity are important in terms of messages and notes . see for further information on comments .
in addition to the overview of your team there is another advantage through the recording of the members of the team : it can be created an event on the team leader if something is happening . see in for further information .
event promotions are actions that are executed if something specific in the project is happening . an example would be the recording of opening and closing of the project , as much someone has worked , or the sending of a message if a file is secured , or a script that will enter a file into CV@@ S , as soon as it will be added to the project , etc ;
on the site Con@@ figuration of Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog can be created , edited and deleted .
an E@@ mail is sent to the mailing list of selected address data . the address can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see in which such guides are set up .
notes are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
ann@@ ot@@ ations is simple . it can be selected either the note -@@ entry from the Editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword can be entered in a commentary box .
ann@@ ot@@ ations can be sent to a unified member of the team . in this case , the nickname @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) , whereby the nickname of the designated nickname of the team member is the leader of the team leader After the enrich@@ ment and Sub@@ project leaders , the appropriate area or sub @-@ project names should be led , as shown in the examples below .
nickname and roll@@ ers @-@ names are independent of large or small friction but spaces around the bra@@ ckets and the : make the note inv@@ alid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ att@@ ing languages which is DT@@ D &apos;s table and web@@ based form@@ att@@ ing and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
the settings are re@@ achable via the Settings menu . only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for others can be found in .
the settings can be set up by settings Qu@@ ant@@ a ... called upon . Dies@@ er@@ dialog covers a few pages that are treated to each other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding cars including car completion can be changed . the entries are :
large / small sni@@ pp@@ le of tags : large / small sni@@ ff from automatically included tags . normal size / small sni@@ ff means that tags are inserted as they are described in the daily XML files .
large / pet@@ ed attribute of attributes : large / small sni@@ ff from automatic attribute . normal bulk / small sni@@ ff means that attributes are inserted as described in the day XML files .
optional tags include : if required , if required , for which the exclusive day is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
start and termination date automatically update : when enabled , the corresponding day will be changed and vice versa .
automatic detection of acc@@ ent signs : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding coding during enem@@ a .
M@@ IM@@ E types : mim@@ yp@@ es for detection of various types of files . using the standard default , the default values can be restored .
standard character encoding : the coding of newly created or in other ways than using file opening files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) , but this setting will be exposed in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . this attitude will be exposed in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates regularly backup copies , allowing for a blackout or crash when the next start of the program can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as the saving of the file . also for non @-@ stored documents , backup will regularly be created .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing area or a personal view ( or the documentation in a cart@@ el ) , which makes it possible to watch the documentation , preview and source code simultaneously .
set the window settings back next to the next start is useful if the user interface has come through , changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depends on views of each other . it meets the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command line parameters .
the warning messages range serves the tax of the possibility to dis@@ able the display of war@@ nings by An@@ ha@@ ken by no more questions .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can change the display of symbols instead of scripts , as the synchron@@ ization of the V@@ PL@@ - and source code view in shared mode . concerning the various Mo@@ di see .
here , the Par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the picture of the Par@@ ser @-@ node in the document , can be adjusted in details .
in the area of mouse click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change the trigger button using the click of the structural building .
in the structural tree settings the visibility of no@@ des can be automatically opened in the tree , the up@@ dating sti@@ ff@@ ness of the tree with editing and how deep in a change of structural tree is to be opened , while empty groups are those in which the current document has not been found .
the area for fixed short@@ cuts ( a type of templates ) can be divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; DT@@ EP ; s . this means it can be a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ cl@@ ause abbrevi@@ ation something else than in a group valid for Jav@@ as@@ cript .
this plug @-@ ins can be administr@@ ated here . plug @-@ ins are used by third page , which can be used by any other part @-@ enabled application , at the most known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; - to insert a plug @-@ in , the following may be stated :
address : the path to the plug@@ in , if it is not at a stand there like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is handed over to the plug@@ in at the start , so it can open the current file , the associated file ( path of current file ) or the project folder .
component in &quot; Only @-@ Read &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in is ref@@ using to store . only @-@ read @-@ k@@ parts normally deny the store when this option is not chosen .
check the plug @-@ in : is this activ@@ ates , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the given information is correct . if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , the trou@@ bl@@ es@@ hooting was completely re@@ developed . diet support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was set , as well as support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ in concept was implemented , which allows different implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins .
currently only one plug @-@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ts .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ ins in the project settings . with the button options next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ in selection box , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface :
a view that is displayed in the content of monitored variable . appears normally in the left Do@@ ck .
a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . appears normally in the lower dock .
a view that is shown in the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . appears normally in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything is available or part of the following functionality .
this promotion becomes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , or it shares the plug @-@ in with , on debit demands . this action is caused by default if a project is opened , so that the normal situation does not have to be considered .
the counter to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session Star@@ te the meeting . closes the connection to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger or exit the l@@ apping to meet requirements .
sends a HTTP requirement to the server to guide a Deb@@ ug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . this requirement is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger issue .
points the Deb@@ ug@@ ger to start with the execution of the script and the current line is continuously available . if this happens while the script will continue , the execution will continue . if it happens , before a debit claim started , the script will start with the request .

this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us to your needs and how you can help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; help to get better .
documentation type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ets ( DT@@ EP ; S ) will be used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; enabling &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; skills such as car completion and scripts ; their simplicity and flexibility makes of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script language or &amp; CSS ; and day file included two file types , the tag and descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files containing the extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars ( above the Edi@@ tier window ) , add text and instructions faster into a document than a user ever could .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s can be created hanging ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see in for details about converting .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool bar . short , one &amp; DT@@ EP ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes of tags as well as the layout and content of the Fe@@ atu@@ res@@ alog@@ es , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the day shows . the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; itself . tool@@ bars allow a quick paste of tags in a document without any risk of writing .
tag files are nothing as a folder . they only contain the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the day XML files . day folders carry the name of the written language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declare if they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advised to use as many users can use a better insight and more information about working with them .
the following chapter describes every element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits will be in a simple way .
this is the root element of a day XML document . it can only contain once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it doesn &apos;t contain anything else than anything else .
the tag type is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( family 2 only )
only valid for the class type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 only )
only valid for the type of Method . is the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 only )
yes , the day has a common attribute group and the attributes added within this tags can be added to any other day . ( family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . that is a mere element type element .
describes a attribute of a tags . this element can only be used once for each attribute . additionally , there is further tags that will describe how this attribute is to be shown &amp; etc ; This is a only element @-@ type element .
speci@@ fies the source codes for the attributes in the Tag Edi@@ tor@@ dialog and in the attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to meet the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p methodology within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a section and a methodology name . the arguments that will be handed to the method . may be empty or % day name % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container day that group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can only be used for an attribute description . it is a single element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of attribute tags within one dialog . this day can only be used for each attribute in a dialog only once ( for example for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specify the position and size of a field in the dialog . this day should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the defin@@ ing tags . this element is a only element type .
there is a list of elements that end up a day . this element is a only element type .
all day XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; Declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ti@@ pped and closed correctly .
space characters influence nothing , but watch out &amp; lt ; sign . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; text &gt; will not be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to review the Tag@@ XML files , the tools can start up in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to launch and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . . another dialogue will appear , its simple instructions will follow .
this function is currently not available . at present , check is only at the loading of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
in the following example , for a family of 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; ELE@@ MENT from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ sch@@ ema . the file name for this day XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following example , for a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file is supposed to be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; class &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also quite simple and there is an editor that can be edited via DT@@ D edit DT@@ D settings ; for one out of a list of selectable &amp; DT@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; it should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = Re@@ verse 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D indication . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nickname .
a action can set up actions with settings ... to be created . click on New Action for the same dialog :
this promotion has been assigned to this action . using the User Station , a key short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ one is the current key short@@ cut .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered into the Det@@ onation settings and inserted in execution of this text in document at the current cur@@ sor position . see example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this promotion , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) , which can change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , the quick start -@@ dialog or the various Look in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML DT@@ EPs .
the first must be given the script &apos;s name and the interpre@@ ter . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line ; $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / scripts in their path : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in command line :
% f : we replaced the current document URL . in case of a local document file , file : / from the document name is removed .
% pi@@ d : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the ongoing &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance is running , the text unique is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ COP is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from external script .
the parameters for this event , normally the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or path to the project file .
in addition to the methods described above , a script input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to default . in the selection box , the default input can be determined , which is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected section of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually useful only with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of issue : normal output , on the default time@@ . it can specify what should be written with the text of the default text , by the value of the selection box is set by :
if there are many tags in the market language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . in this case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool bar with the name of the market .
once a tool bar is added , you will need to add actions and configure actions . select Settings actions .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts the edit mode .
fill in all necessary fields and add them to the appropriate tool bar .
complete everything and , in case the tag attributes and you plan your use , enable dialog &quot; to edit &quot; tag , &quot; if available , so that a input when using the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is that a bad symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have trouble .
for creating a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; k@@ icon@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphics , other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ icon@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose edit size other .
please note that the created symbol is not only helping you to note what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; .
in terms of that the day starts , then , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually referred to as los , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should be at least a message to the user . start@@ led ; -@@ tag is going to be inserted in the current document .
after the creation of the symbol it must still be connected to the action . this happens via the menu with settings of actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the button and continue on with other tags , so it is still what gives , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions to the tool bar or it should set this for a better overview of some separ@@ ator into multiple groups . open the tool@@ bar via settings tool@@ bars . make sure the required tool@@ bar is selected .
I would like to select the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my tool bar . after selecting the Element@@ es , which should be added to the tool bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I want a fast way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview , I &apos;ll select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note , as the separ@@ ator does not support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool bar may believe that the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Button the opposite of the start button .
the new tool bar must be tested by creating all symbols to ensure that everything works .
back in the right folder . after Neu@@ e@@ XML doesn &apos;t exist , it will be stored im@@ bal file , but your tool@@ bars ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust their &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their tool@@ bars ( s ) will be loaded ( will be ) if a file is opened from the corresponding type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user , the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ att@@ ing language that you like to enjoy . thus , this chapter describes how I create an &amp; PHP ; document @-@ tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory if someone has done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; language . then you &apos;ll need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . let the first part we leave you to the second we treat here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c you = p@@ ad , relative to this file , for example ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these document@@ ations , e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Section 2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ html @-@ 2 = tors 2.@@ html @-@ 2 = tag@@ 2@@ html @-@ 2 = tag@@ 2@@ html @-@ 3 = day@@ .@@ html @-@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree produces the visible portion of documentation in the document tree . for example , see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c you = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html G@@ etting Start@@ ed = Introduction , ... Introduction = dex@@ tion@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = long @-@ synchron@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before G@@ etting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this shows that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for chess problems ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents are refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently the upper end of the construction supervision &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; file is displayed ! ) .
space characters influence nothing , but watch out &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; res@@ sources will be replaced .
the section section is the range of do@@ cr@@ c file , which is to be shown to the design of the context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; -@@ Script the documentation would display the my@@ sq@@ l _ fet@@ ch _ array function . there are only two types of entries here . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file association @-@ lines .
a simple list of separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c and make up to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / etc / qu@@ ant@@ a / doc or copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that these are well and worth being shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation were used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory for the use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory for the use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Society . they will not be rich , but proud of being involved in the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the her@@ ni@@ ated resources ( DT@@ EP packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or else . at different places there is an e @-@ mail menu entry , as DT@@ D DT@@ D Package ( DT@@ EP ) with email , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users are checked and only made available for the publication . in order to sign a useful contribution , we recommend to sign the resources for a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the source of resources guarantees , both for our team and for later users .
when up@@ loading , you will be asked for their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys , you may have an exit . in the dialogue New resource you will have to stay empty ( URL @-@ preview can be empty ) and with clicking OK the upload .
upload the upload DT@@ D DT@@ D Package ( DT@@ EP ) to upload factory tool@@ bars , and can be started in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts .
after downloading a resource , nor before installation , exam@@ ines &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and the signature . if the integrity is given and the resource is correct , a message appears with the name of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages which is currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , creation can be time @-@ consuming , because hundreds of tag files can be necessary in day XML format . there is easier way to convert DT@@ D automatically into a DT@@ EP package .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D Store and Conver@@ ting a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which is to be used . afterwards the following dialog appears :
objective name : the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Defin@@ i@@ ration line : the string that is used in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tag , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d
for the course of the DT@@ EP after the conversion : if enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this opportunity .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand this and full use of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you must first create this fundamental concepts with these fundamental concepts . this chapter attempts to bring them closer to these concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and projects . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; available . from tool@@ bars over actions is everything that is marked as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administr@@ ators , different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are available to each in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements present a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local items are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; - patterns up to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a specific project . simply said , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder &apos;s tree , making the common use of special tools and patterns of all the staff within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Edi@@ tor@@ ch window , the building views , the cart@@ ons with information and the tool@@ bars . please check in and for further information on these areas .
you can click the boxes with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document pass@@ able entries , like close to the current , other or all the boxes , restart , or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right click in the Edi@@ tor@@ area leads to another context menu on the processed document content , such as basic editing steps ( copying / paste / paste ) , processing the word under the mouse pointing device or open the file , if the string is described below the mouse po@@ inter .
at the top end of the Edi@@ tor@@ f@@ enst@@ ers are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bars will be shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the tool@@ bar will be adapted to the new functions and thereby associated user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert into their document , then click the symbol that represents the day . if you want to insert the data for this just inserted day . if you want to add some attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the construction views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , open and walk through . in the presentation with cart@@ ei@@ vers are available for files , project , pattern processes , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation construction views .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all the files in the project using right mou@@ sec@@ lick . actions such as adding , removal , upload or delete files from the storage medium can be done with the then shown context menu .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; There are all possibilities .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; work area . global templates are always available , local templates only for the respective users and templates in projects are only us@@ eless in the project . more to templates are available .
here you can find information on the available scripts . the concept of inclusion in Global , Local and Project works here . by clicking on the left @-@ hand mouse button , you can retri@@ eve the available information on a script . via the right mouse button , further functions are available , such as the script , to edit or send an email .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by links @-@ clicking of an elementary proposition , the cur@@ sor will set up the position of the element . by right @-@ click of an elementary proposition opens a list of commands in relation to navigation and refresh@@ ment of the tree .
this tree appears below the other construction views . with it , some attributes and nam@@ esp@@ ace can change with it . it allows to change the contents of all available attributes with a few cli@@ cks .
here is the complete documentation on the Web @-@ technique for your development . you can create your documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be edited , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two cart@@ els at the bottom of the window , which can be achieved using the beneficial information : the news window and the problem window .
this box shows information about each in Qu@@ ant@@ a running script . such as the DT@@ D of current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this cardboard box shows all errors in the current document of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ scripts that are executed , do all error messages ( such as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are expanded extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding order . the chocolate @-@ page of the tool bar is the possibility to define independent commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool bar with E@@ mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar archive over &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they get a tool bar in an email , they can secure these in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other and download !
it &apos;s reasonable if you want to adapt the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; files on your system . to get a complete list of all options , you give . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check whether your path contains the &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 bin folder . also , you should ensure that no older version of &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H before their bin folder . it is the same for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; was optimized for a fast web development and combines a mature development environment with a wide range of powerful functions .
during an effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , an independent , ext@@ end@@ able market @-@ up languages would say ? well , this would make it be the absolute most powerful web development tool for &amp; K@@ DE ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the appropriate &amp; IDE ;
well , to the af@@ ore@@ mentioned claim must be kept that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; K@@ DE ; developer community is not only possible for someone else ? thanks to the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ sm@@ ells , not only this is possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to expand as they need it for their need .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows web development to improve the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . through self @-@ yesterday &apos;s actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task possible . through the program Kom@@ som@@ ites you can see &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; extending without any scripts of scrip@@ ting skills . ( read more about it in . )
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for quick web development and quickly developed to a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; Plus is in any way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in detail more detailed documentation is provided with help : / qu@@ ant@@ a ( either enter this URL into &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; help : / qu@@ ant@@ a run ) .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; is currently being developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time when you open a file , which is not included , where the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for the later use . if you are trying to store the selected file / text outside the local / project presentation folder , only an error is reported .
converted to paste from the cli@@ p@@ board there , special characters used for &amp; HTML ; -@@ Sch@@ ed@@ ging , that it is correct and not to be understood by the browser as form@@ att@@ ing instruction .
convert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ Connect , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first line to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
switches the block selection . it allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; shift ; button to select .
go directly to a line number . that &apos;s very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ Script error message !

shows the symbol @-@ old left from the main window . this column allows you to put book@@ marks with a mouse click .
when reading book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu with entries of previous or next , depending on the cur@@ sor position in the document .

to insert files to insert files into the current project . the selected files are then copied to the project directory .
searches the project list after new files that could be there . that enables you to copy graphics files into your project folder or a sub @-@ folder and add them to the project .
downloads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and if you have a further input / output modules ( Ki@@ o Sl@@ aves ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects you will find the details .
invites you to find a project tool . these are kept in Project / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu , if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
opens up a dialog to add a new tool bar . these tool@@ bars can be set up using settings . tool@@ bars will be saved by tool tool@@ bars or you will be asked when you want to store the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool bar from the point of view . it does not delete from the hard disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you will be asked whether you would like to do this .
this allows you to send her own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Team , that the tool bar is present in the next release ) . the menu option opens a new E@@ Mail message with the tool@@ bar as an app@@ endi@@ x .
allows the upload of tool@@ bars onto the main server , where any other can access it . see in .
charging a &amp; DT@@ D ; that you or any someone else has and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
load / offset of the du@@ ti@@ ties from the &amp; DT@@ D ; is meaningful if the du@@ ti@@ ties consist of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; if this global is not present and a write permission in the global K@@ DE file is not available , it fails to load the loading .
this menu contains a list of tags provided in the currently loaded tool bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard that contains the tags / actions on this tool bar .
allows access to the current day setup dialog , if there is one . this entry is always available in the menu tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activ@@ ating or de@@ activated the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us means that insert the tool@@ bar if this day has contra@@ di@@ ct the rules .
in the plug @-@ ins menu , the available plug @-@ ins available under the menu option are listed below . click on . click to activate a activated plug @-@ in .

immediate switching between the different types of user interface . by some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the switch can sometimes need time or in@@ nice graphics . recommended is the box office mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which is the default in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu for each open sub@@ window contains one entry . with a selection of a contract , the appropriate sub@@ window is activated .
switches the display of the status bar at the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main track respectively .
changes in this dialogue influence each application that use the K@@ HTML role , including the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .

a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars or which can change and follow the sequences .
this should create a help according to the environment &apos;s environment , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as at any open source project , developers can always use aid . if you want to support &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled at the top of the bottom of the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project automatically complet@@ es . all these paths and author information fields can be later extended with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . if you enter the name , file will be filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can find the server address of the machine , which one wants to access , except for local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used . depending on the remote user &apos;s setting , an adaptation could be needed .
this is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files used for different projects should be used instead of the standard .
this is the folder in which the tool@@ bars for the project is stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files used for different projects should be used instead of the standard .
that allows to add files from the local file system into the project . you can select multiple files or folder .
this setting is great if you want to download and change it . if you want to download and change it . if you want to download and change it , you have to go differently with ser@@ vers@@ ed scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc . ) .
if files , which are located somewhere in the main part of the project , will be set up . if a project is new , it will not be an@@ ha@@ ken .
this option displays all files and folders within the main folder and you can take a precise selection of vou@@ ches .
this shows a list of files in the main file . you can select the required files by check@@ box or , by removing the h@@ ooks , out of the project .
the last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be changed in the menu with Project Properties in the menu space in the menu profiles , or with the key shift Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholder possible ) , which are re @-@ read for project @-@ related operations such as project folder .
comple@@ mentary option on top , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ signals are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded during opening of the project , can be read more about projections .
the desired de@@ bug@@ gers can be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in can be set with the button options . in this case , the bug fixes .
in the sub@@ window profile , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by showing their own construction supervision for each profile .
in the sub @-@ window team configuration , project members may be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see details in the details .
in the sub@@ window event configuration , you can switch event actions and add these actions , change or delete . event actions are executed once a certain event happens , such as the backing of a file . see in details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us opens ; the last project that was opened . you can &apos;t influence this behavior .
to open another project , select the project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the project will open , and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file will automatically be stored . you will be asked whether you want to save changes before leaving when qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens if you upload a new project .
the project supervision provides free access to the files in the project . there you can be administr@@ ated in the current project .
folders are likewise , however , open the entries of opening and opening ... in the context menu ( with the right mouse button menu ) :
the profile can be selected here . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows the removal of the actual profile . if only a profile is available , the button is b@@ lown off to prevent removing removing .
the password will keep in the core memory and forgot on Progra@@ mmer . this opportunity is useful if common up@@ loading files is needed and the more un@@ safe password on the plate store does not come into question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave dialogue when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many high load profiles can be uploaded and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded onto various servers . when editing or creating a profile will show this dialogue :
this is the server name to be copied to files . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and the installed Ki@@ o Sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; ft@@ p ; , file ( locally ) and NFS can choose .
port for transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator runs a service not at the usual port .
depending on your Ang@@ st@@ ink , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it according to your discretion . the password is stored on the plate , so it can &apos;t be read easily , but everyone with programm@@ ers can easily be seen in clear text .
a project view is only one set files and tool@@ bars . it can be loaded in a project by many views , i.e. by simple exchange of view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded , and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be stored or deleted in the menu project or the project tool bar , accessible via Settings tool tool@@ bar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to its own mode .
as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; best above the tool@@ bars tool@@ bar . use and add @-@ in . adding tool@@ bars is described below in the section Add by tool@@ bars .
tool@@ bars and symbols can be adjusted either via context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which with new action , will remove tool tool@@ bars or tool@@ bars , which can be specified in the dialogue , which may be indicated which actions should be visible on this or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menus to an action ( symbol ) on a tool bar , in addition to remove the entries promotion and action , that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bar and the actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu , setting tool tool@@ bars ... and set up actions .
templates are in the essential document skel@@ eton , code cuts and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used templates basically like a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , post@@ p@@ one or any at the system &apos;s existing directory in the storage room . templates are set in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the restrictions you have for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions indicated in the beginning of each template .
binary is all that is not pure text . it can normally be inserted in documents by links ( e.g. images with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in stock space under global templates . more information about the Templ@@ ates tree is available in .
documents can be done by any text document type . based on this templates , new documents can be created . normally more specific documents can be created in respective sub@@ folders . it is usually done a simple sc@@ aff@@ ection for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in such a way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the storage room under global templates . see in for more information about the Templ@@ ates tree .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document is based on a template but the same text area will always be inserted into the documents . you can find everything from a comment via a final menu system on Jav@@ as@@ cript or Perl base . some examples are available in stock room under global templates . see in for more information about the Templ@@ ates tree .
as the name says , these templates are for whole websites as templates . they are a collection of different documents organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
design a document structure according to your ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File As submission to store local template ....
as soon as this happened , you notice that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) , the template is not visible in the project tree . check in the storage room under project projects .
select text in your document and click to store file as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be drawn with pulling and drain on the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file is only able to copy only into one template folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as pulling and inser@@ ting or insert over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on a folder or in the project files tree view on a folder , click on the template &apos;s template and secure a name for the template . by default , it can be saved as local or global presentation .
project projects allow a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ er with &amp; PHP ; shape , insert files or link with them . additionally , you can keep some things using using templates in projects very profound in the eye .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files contained in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / Templ@@ ates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / Templ@@ ates . each of this folder meets one of four types of containers , as described above .
to determine the behavior of a folder is to click on the folder with the right mouse button and select in the context menu features . the following dialogue appears :
a select field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is blind@@ ed when El@@ ter@@ istic attributes is disgu@@ sted .
this is enabled by default and adapted for everything except for ordinary folders . if a regular file would be stopped , it would be explic@@ it activated in this path except it would be explic@@ it . in case of a normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , it is likely to be found in a regular file .
allowed earlier or presented text for templates in this folder . this could be general sc@@ roll or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project , allowing copying of contents into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ er a whole presentation already with the appropriate header lines / foot@@ er lines .
in addition , we have a text @-@ up menu ( showing the right mouse button ) to add or copy and add templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source code editor that can be reached via the menu . the first mode replaces the source code editor through the V@@ PL ; editor and the second is shared the editing window in two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; Editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; - page and an cur@@ sor . then you can edit and when needed for source code editor , in which the changes in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor to a document that includes &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; file editor . to edit &amp; PHP , it is still the source code editor . there are no plans to change this code .
the second mode works exactly as the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor syn@@ ch@@ ron , this mode is already active , the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke uses the active cur@@ sor of a window to others , where the position is maintained in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source code editor is set to set up via Settings ... After selecting V@@ PL ; -@@ View may be set between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in general , the recommendation can be adjusted automatically . in principle , the recommendation can be adjusted for fast computer and a great span for slow computer .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so the processing of invisible tags is possible in working with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called upon , as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor , which is to change the h@@ unter . so you can change the following :
met@@ a @-@ tags allow the storage of information on the document itself , e.g. whi@@ ch@@ words for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click into the list allows the change of the input , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword Key@@ word 2 on the content .
CSS rules are the new way to design the identification of pages in browser . you can add CSS rules using buttons below the list or delete . a change on the list is possible as with the met@@ a @-@ elements , which is currently not supported by CSS rules .
it is possible to bind an external CSS @-@ style template by pressing the File button and select the corresponding file .
the use of cur@@ sor is like in a word processor , possible through due to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing or sh@@ atter .
the tags of tags is made in the same way via the tool@@ bars , as in the source code editor , it is necessary to note that the paste does not be inserted in identical identical tags , e.g. when an anchor tag is inserted with text , any other surrounding anch@@ ors must be removed .
some tool bar like the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; they will need to work the tables or lists of tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ sl@@ d@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for exam@@ ining style templates . in contrast to other programs for styles , the search for certain elements is possible and the design of the style template can be followed .
to comp@@ ile &amp; x@@ sl@@ d@@ b@@ g ; successfully comp@@ ile , except &amp; K@@ DE ; nor the lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt libraries , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are present at a typical installation of &amp; K@@ DE ; already available .

there are many graphic tools for compar@@ ing . so why &amp; diff@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contributions made many changes , and at the same time the entry was corrected . another programmer had changed much text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts in mer@@ ging .
the program used by me was only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly had changed within this lines . and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps only the inser@@ tion had changed . the mer@@ ging of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could be differences within one line and changes to white signs . later , any quantity of further useful functions were added .
if you want to compare text quickly , copy it simply into the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the compar@@ ative window .
a function which made a lot of work was the compar@@ ing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
also 3 @-@ way co @-@ merge is fully supported . this is useful if two people can work independently from one piece of co@@ de and changes . the original file ( the base ) helps the resolution of conflicts and shows at the same time the expected outcome . in this editor , you can even directly edit the results directly . the screenshot shows three Qu@@ ell files to merge :
&amp; diff@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you with the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging complete folder . this screen photo shows &amp; diff@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folder merge :
&amp; diff@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and operate the options of today &apos;s color monitors . if you have to check co@@ de frequently , you will like this feature .
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are shown clearly . if lines only differ in certain number of white characters , you can see the summary at a summary in the column at the left side . ( no trouble longer if any one changes the inser@@ tion . )
if one file is equal , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means both files differ .
if all files are the same name but in different folders , then you can make yourself completely exp@@ orting the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example :
diff@@ use 2 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder
opening dialog allows manual setting of fil@@ en@@ ames , select the selection above the file browser ( file ... ) or the Select a recently opened file . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file . if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences are carried out with two files .
over the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons or merge takes place . if for A file is selected , for B and C , however , a folder , then use &amp; de@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders .
if merge is enabled , the input field is active for target and can be changed . however , it is not necessary to determine immediately an output file . you can do this step later when saving .
the set @-@ button opens a dialog with settings . here you can define options before you start with the compar@@ isons / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a file , but only parts of a text compare . &amp; diff@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board to the active compar@@ ative window . in the opening process , you don &apos;t need to select any files you can simply connect the dialog using the sender button .
you can also use Zi@@ thro@@ es and Use : simply draw a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a compar@@ ative window .
which idea is behind it ? sometimes it contains a file such as several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would have only two corresponding files , they would be able to copy them into &amp; diff@@ diff@@ 3 ; you can simply copy and then compare the relevant sections .
note : at the moment you can &apos;t pull out anything &amp; diff@@ diff@@ 3 ; just the fine text in a compar@@ ative window is supported .
warning : some editors interpre@@ t the pulling and inser@@ tion of text into another program as out@@ crop and insert ( instead of copying and insert ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text box is the info line . the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Any Info line has a different color . ( if the path is too long , let the mouse lie for a while on the line . then a small aux@@ ili@@ ary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . A has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these settings can be changed via the Settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , one sees the color which differs from different files . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s good in the next section ( merge ) good .
in addition to the text , the check column column . if differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , for example , white characters are only available in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare individuals . )
the vertical line , which separates the merge column of text , will be interrupted at places where the respective source file is activated . if the line breaks is activated , the line is shown at broken lines .
the result window ( among the compar@@ ative Americans ) also has a info @-@ line with the inscription : , the file name and &#91; changes &#93; if you have processed the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! to all conflicts are dissolved , Save the buttons ! ! ! ( use the buttons jump to next sol@@ dered / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ ators are used , any difference is also to be solved in the same time .
by clicking on the left hand column in one of the window , the group is displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will appear in every window , where the beginning of the group will not be visible . ) This group will then highlighted the current group . it will be highlighted with color background colour for current area and on the left side a black bar will appear .
sometimes , through the automatic mer@@ ging or through manual processing , no more line is left in the group ; this is only a plac@@ eholder for the event that you can change your mind and perhaps again choose another source . this text is not displayed in the final stored file , nor in a marking that you may copy and elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; assembly works ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the results window . go carefully with this function .
note : if you choose the options , the options ignore or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments enabled , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
navigate primarily with the image and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are in one of the window , you can use the arrow keys to the left , right , end , Str@@ g @-@ beginning and tr@@ l end , si@@ w how you can also use it from other programs . the transfer column will also be used by other programs .
in the eye @-@ window you can also use the other buttons to edit . using the insert button , you can switch between insert and over@@ lap mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left @-@ hand mouse button synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective Group ( as already stated in the section ) and the edi@@ table window .
the tool bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / previous difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture ) to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture ) or the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , there must be a conflict between deleted and un@@ solved conflicts .
to copy the selection in the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the copying -@@ button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or tr@@ l insert ) . if this option is activated , which will always mark your cli@@ p@@ board automatically and the manual copy fails . be careful , because you could acci@@ dentally over@@ write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
Z@@ eil@@ ers are stored according to the under@@ lying operating system . UNIX versions are using a Z@@ eil@@ en@@ feed sign \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use vehicle re@@ feed + Z@@ eil@@ en@@ closures \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 reserves the source code of the source file , so you should not use &amp; diff@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using binary files .
the options and list of the last used files will be automatically stored and re@@ produced at the next start . ( menu insert - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 )
select a script with a fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides writings with variable width , you should not use it . )
if you enable this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c font . if the chosen font does not support this representation , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered rendered . on these systems , the button automatically displays an odd colour .
when this option is enabled , the pres@@ et button is inserted the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator sign will be inserted .
if you push or press Return , the previous line will be automatically used for the next line .
when this option is enabled , any selection automatically is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . manual copy the cli@@ p@@ board then .
you can choose which line @-@ end type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used .
while using files tries &amp; diff@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines can be ignored in the source file . only during this first step , white characters are ignored . in this step , white characters are not ignored . even when together , white signs are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a vehicle retri@@ eve &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , and then you could save only one Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ue &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored &amp; diff@@ diff@@ 3 ; the car race mark , but then you could be treated differently with different sizes . during the merge this option must be disabled . in default , this option is disabled .
default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) ignored . in the result , the differences are still shown , but they will be treated like white characters .
default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
intensive after even smaller differences . the option is activated in default . it is effectively in complicated and large files , but slowly at very large files .
in the automation mode , this setting is determined , as long as the result of the selection is indicated before the next un@@ solved conflict will continue .
trig@@ gers all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file as a source . if you want this only from time to time , you can better use the functions Cho@@ le A / B / C for all un@@ scal@@ able white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments , if the options ignore or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments enabled .
these options are treated in the chapter on the scanning of folders and through a mer@@ ging of mer@@ ging . look for details under documentation to the directory and merge connection .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , the original version is the suff@@ ix .@@ original box . if already such a backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ original exists , this will be deleted without any further backup .
adap@@ ting the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently ongoing program . you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; end and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is set in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; because the language is set on the control centre globally . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if one activated this option , the top setting is used for all entries .
via the selection fields for encoding appears a short note , which is the local coding . ( this can &apos;t be changed here and has a purely informal character . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this affect how special characters are treated and interpreted . as encoding for each file can be adjusted individually , even files can be compared and combined with different coding .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding must be used for storing .
if you define pre @-@ processing command , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files can be 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the processing command can only be done with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can define the encoding of the issue of processing commands .
switch this off to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting of changes in the text or over@@ sight . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options ignore or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments enabled . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , you may only see the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed next to normal nor a second transfer column with the required information .
sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines . just send the less important window . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
arran@@ ges the comparison window next to each other or succ@@ essi@@ vely . this can also be useful for viewing of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes consider the differences and then decide if you compare only two files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file it will be handed over to this external command . in &amp; diff@@ diff@@ 3 ; the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre @-@ processor , which is exactly your requirements . you can use this function for example to remove dis@@ rup@@ tive parts or to correct the input .
when reading a file it is given first to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is given ( see above ) , the output of this command command is used . the output of the command is used only when the line is equal . each input line must have an associated issue line .
the idea behind it is to enable the user to enable more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program yourself . however , the good news is , however , that in most cases linked or per@@ l perfectly sufficient .
in this connection , use this pre@@ processing command to convert the input to major letters : SE@@ D &apos;@@ S / \ \ ( . * \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ ) refers to the folded text in the first cl@@ amp . the \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in upper case letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some key words to automatically generated character strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with drivers , you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may like this regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the Ig@@ nor@@ ing of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further processing command for Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ ys@@ . sed &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hits will be replaced by nothing .
sometimes you might want to perform several results at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use to separate the results from each other . example :
instead of sed , you can also use something different such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switch &apos; However at per@@ l some details differently . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal Pre@@ processor are maintained for viewing and mer@@ ging . the further operations will only change the data , which the line @-@ like al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus can be seen .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ off @-@ processor is the output of the normal pre@@ processor .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as in any function , the text changes or differences , you may acci@@ dentally notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often you need to edit a lot of files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and assemble full file with &amp; de@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder .
... for each object a proposal to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can the merge sim@@ ulate and shows the sim@@ ulated changes , without it really perform ,
... selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of individual files . you just need to specify files on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three files are collected , folder 1 is used as a base . if no target file is given , use &amp; diff@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as a target file .
note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically , not the merge . to select the merge , you &apos;ll need to press the respective menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see further details . )
while reading the folder you will inform you a little news window about the current progress . if you cancel the scanning the folder , only the files are listed , which have been compared to then .
when scanning the folder is complete , shows &amp; diff@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
any file and file that was found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure will normally be displayed usually . you can click on the + / - button , or click on the object double or by clicking on the object ) or push the arrow keys to the left / right .
when you click on a file , the file comparison will start and it appears a compar@@ ative window .
the symbol in the column Name reflects the file type in the first file ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window of the selected object . in such a case , the assembly @-@ clock action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind .
as seen in the above picture , in the columns A / B / C , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used .
identical entries , the color is identical , even if the age of entries are different .
folders are regarded as identical , if their overall content is identical . then you also have the same color . with folders , the age is un@@ significant for its color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . colours reflect the colors of a leaf which is only green , then yellow becomes yellow and later when it is old , red becomes red .
... A and C are identical but not B : copying B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical but not a : copy from A ( or if a doesn &apos;t exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C does not have the same file type ( e.g. A folder and B a file ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory data types . as long as such f@@ law@@ ed objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B not have the same file type ( e.g. A folder and B a file is ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory data types . as long as such f@@ law@@ ed objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
the mode for synchron@@ ize is active , if only two folder and no explic@@ it target file is specified , and if the option is synchron@@ ize directories . then select &amp; diff@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so afterwards both folders are identical .
... A and B exist , but not identical : mer@@ ging and the result in both folders . ( the user looks as the visible file name for the output file only B ; right after mer@@ ging copies &amp; diff@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders will be merged , then select &amp; de@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and proposes the newer file to copy . if the file are different , but the same date appears differently , but the date is identical .. such as such errors are not removed , the merge cannot be started .
during the merge , a file is processed after the other . it &apos;s status column indicates , and according to other messages when something unexpected can be completed . if the merge is completed , you should take a final review and see if the status is fine .
if in alignment dialog , the file compar@@ ative method is selected , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display another columns . these contain the number of un@@ loaded , dissolved , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for dissolved conflicts is only shown if three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either run the selected entry ( file or or@@ aries ) or all entries on one . if you have chosen all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start together .
please note : if you have no target file specified , then in the three @-@ file merge mode C is used as the target , the B and / or B is used as a target .
if you chose a target folder , please check if all entries are displayed in the target folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options to be ski@@ pped in folder structure . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to lead all entries : select directory together / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( key short@@ cut ) : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if caused by contra@@ dic@@ tory data types still inv@@ alid merge actions , a message appears on the in@@ correct elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you complete any entries , a dialogue window will appear with the options , sim@@ ulate and break .
choose sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen , without the really changes made . you will then get an exhaus@@ tive list of all actions .
&amp; diff@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute specific actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is needed ( execute a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( please note the screenshot ) .
if you &apos;re done with a file , select another directory together / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you still haven &apos;t saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then , &amp; de@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work continues with the next entry .
if &amp; diff@@ diff@@ 3 ; on an error , a message and detailed status information appears . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to select the problem of the problem . if you have the option to select another action for the entry or to solve the problem in any way before you proceed with the mer@@ ging .
in case some entries were individually collected , you can notice &amp; de@@ diff@@ 3 ; this entries ( in the current session ) and leads them not again later , these entries are taken as a matter . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... ) now has a section called directory mer@@ ging with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern will be shown in the elementary tree . separate patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not correspond to this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not shown in the elementary tree . it can be given more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not shown in the elementary tree . it can be given more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
ignore files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mati@@ sch produced files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this file is specific with a .@@ c@@ v@@ signals file . ( see under info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ signals . )
in some file systems files have a checked attribute . in other file systems there is a default point . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the Element@@ um or not . this option is enabled in default .
in links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in default .
in case of links on folder : if the option is switched off , the links like normal ste@@ wards are treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; diff@@ diff@@ 3 ; do not apply to a folder of a link to himself and &amp; diff@@ diff@@ 3 ; crash@@ es off . ) This option is switched off in default .
leads a complete analysis of each file by and displays statistics columns . ( the number of sol@@ dered , un@@ powder , non@@ - white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when it is applied to files that do not contain any text . ( specify an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large files via a slow network , it may be easier to compare only the date of date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is stored in default .
similar to confidenti@@ ality date of date . there is no real comparison instead . these files are regarded as identical , if they are equal to any size . that can be useful for example when copying the date of date . please use caution . this option is stored in default .
activ@@ ating the synchron@@ ize mode , if two files are compared and no target file specified . in this mode , the proposals for mer@@ ging files are identical to both folders . also , the results of merge files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default .
if there are differences , instead of merge the copy of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is assumed as uncertain , because it is assumed that the other file has not been changed . ) This option is switched off in default .
if a file or folder will be replaced or deleted , the original version is renamed and receives the extension .@@ orig@@ . if an old backup file is deleted with the .@@ original extension already , this also affects the normal mer@@ ging of single files , not only the merge whole file . this option is enabled in default .
normally , the file merge display remains visible , you can shift the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want to change the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want , you can switch the window directory &amp; text window to switch between the windows and text windows between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file via double @-@ click . however , there is also a corresponding menu entry . you can also use a single file directly , without only the folder will run . once you store the result , the status will be reset , and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder .
however , this status is lost , however , when you read the directory again : directory menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of Ki@@ o Sl@@ aves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders to open on local or remote computer .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local file .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things you should note :
a path can be relatively . or .. s . that &apos;s not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolutely .

the main purpose is currently as a difference in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op first starts to start the built @-@ in differences . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button over the differences and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part show from the context menu .
normally needed &amp; diff@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is applied as a part , &amp; de@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; de@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that if not the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since generation of the patch file .
if &amp; diff@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . the merge or compar@@ ing of folders is not supported in part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now hot it is Com@@ pare ) . in addition , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs already very long and have learned a lot in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who have gone this path or go so .
you probably compiled the program from the sources and configure the configure script by the correct PRE@@ F@@ IX . in the default configure / usr / local , but then K@@ DE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information about this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are first treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is not identical as yet . i@@ F similar lines . next to Each other , this tri@@ b@@ is , but this b@@ is often the case .
the editor is noticeable for any difference in the files where it begins and where it ends . however , this important information is lost , however , if the result is simply stored as text file , and it &apos;s too much effort to design extra a private file format which could save this information .
the effort for this was so far too big . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text should be another editor .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c lin@@ ts ; and the text does not delete . what does that mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; diff@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to empha@@ size from differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and l@@ acks the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all the features of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.1 or newer .
for information , as you can use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE you can find on the homepage .
a list of the latest changes will be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the Qu@@ el package .
to comp@@ ile &amp; install diff@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; K@@ DE ; to comp@@ ile and install , use the following command in the basic set of &amp; de@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system installed in which K@@ DE is installed . if you are uncertain , you will find further details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no problems with comp@@ iling . if you still have difficulty , please report on the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists thereof .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or orbit ) copy into the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or orbit @-@ insert ) add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current mark .
only differences are : files are identical in all folders that are not in folder structure , and therefore do not appear in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you have to read the folder with the function Ref@@ res@@ h ) to these options . )
only entries are displayed , the differences are indicated . in case the target file does not already contain in the target file . if the target file does not already contain these files , they are missing according to merge . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in the default program .
note the buttons to choose from the source with the labelling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are attached to the end of the selected group in the results window ( if they are already present ) , if the lines are already present , they will be removed when clicking on the button .
default , this option is de@@ activated . the differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a miniature preview of all virtual working surfaces . it is quite convenient to change the ongoing programmes on the work@@ spaces , to change their size , to end or move it . this works both within a desktop and also several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can show all virtual work@@ spaces as well as the applications . applications can be selected and even be moved on desktop and other applications .
with the medium mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible within a desktop , as well as other spaces .
the context menu depends where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context menu has only been set up on the empty background ... and end . if , however , the context menu and the name of the application , as well as the entries minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , at desktop and end .
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of desktop . appears only if it was cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to selected virtual desktop . only appears when it was cli@@ cked on an application .
if this cross field is marked , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the medium mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ spaces .
when this field is crossed , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of virtual working surfaces are displayed .
cross the field allows the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displaying the numbers of virtual working surfaces . it is provided together with name , the names are provided with ordin@@ ance numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop .
when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also shown as a background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displayed .
when this field is crossed , the ongoing programmes are displayed as small windows in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty work@@ spaces are shown to allow their selection .
here is the view of the programming window . simple , simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the programming window . symbol shows the window with their standard symbol and pixels . note : pixel resolution is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main f@@ lin@@ ers can appear : classic leaves &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in some other window managers appear ; horizont@@ ally , all virtual working areas in a horizontal and ver@@ tically show in a vertical line , which is very good for the display at the side of mind .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager miniature program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display window as symbols or with their content and move away . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
click the mouse button to set up in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and set out the switch from the switch ... allows you to display the dialog settings .
at the moment , this can not be changed in the dialog settings : but you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t have to contact the file server or turn to your system administrator . in this file , you must enter the key wind@@ ow@@ Transpar@@ ent mode and refer to that value . possible values are :
since &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package base is , you need an functioning installation of the K@@ DE Group package .

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen size . you can use &amp; k@@ mag , a portion of the screen . this application is interesting for different users . this application includes artists , web designers , and people with a vision . this documentation is to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; co@@ mag .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very efficient use which is constantly expanding to expand new functions . it is optimised for use on high @-@ performance machines .
if you &amp; k@@ mag , a window as pictured above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag , displays the enlarged area of screen . in the following , this window appears as an extension window . the image that is displayed in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of screen and is referred to as the selection window .
in the default setting , &amp; k@@ like ; the area around the mouse pointing device like a mobile micro@@ scope . alternatively , you can &amp; can be able to display a selected screen range in the enlargement window ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) .
want to avoid that the mouse indicator is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse pointing device . please note that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the form of the mouse po@@ inter . this is always the standard K@@ DE ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse @-@ indicator .
in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can change it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways :
move the mouse pointing to the enlargement window and hold the left mouse button , so you can move the contents of the enlargement window and move . this also goes with the arrows keys .
if you need to push the &amp; Shift ; button or add the M@@ MB ; you can post@@ p@@ one the select window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection process is fixed and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; k@@ mag . features a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , copy to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later in other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
starting or stops the up@@ dating of the ad . stop the up@@ dating , that the required CPU time goes to 0 .
select the Update rate ( Very low , low , medium , high , very high ) . the higher the up@@ dating rate , the more CPU time is required .
in this mode , a select window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your typ@@ ed short command to save files , opening a new window , print , new@@ com@@ ets ( with the button document again re@@ load in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ) , magni@@ f@@ ters , shred@@ ders &amp; etc .
k@@ mag also known as &amp; k@@ ak@@ fier ; is a screen size . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to use a range of screen to look at the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is suitable for different people of use : from research or artist to the web@@ designer or tend@@ han@@ dicapped .
detailed user documentation you can find with help : / k@@ mag ( either enter this URL into the address bar of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start a hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mag ) .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse indicator has waited for a while at the same point . it is intended to help people who suffer the RS@@ I Syndrome ( re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ strain @-@ track syndrome ) and which every mouse click pains .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse indicator gets a while on the same place . it is thought to help people who em@@ ulate the re@@ peti@@ tive strain inhibit@@ ing ( RS@@ I ) syndrome , and which every mouse click pains . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . however , this requires a little exercise .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle pain when using the mouse button and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you can cause pain that are related to your computer &apos;s use , if you are looking for a doctor if this is not done .
to clari@@ fy it again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will avoid pain that arise when clicking with the mouse , it is against pain that are caused by the beam because of the mouse , and as with all ergonomic aux@@ ili@@ ary agents : the result can vary for each differently .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and execute a mouse click , once you inter@@ rupt the movement .
if the intelligent re@@ loc@@ ating is enabled , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after the push of the mouse button is em@@ ulated . you can now move the mouse button before leaving the mouse button . this way you can remove the bri@@ dging with pressed mou@@ st@@ aste . the intelligent del@@ eting requires a little exercise , but you get used to get used quickly .
this soft time must be completed following the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click .
if Intel@@ li@@ gn@@ es is switched on , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will be waiting for the mouse button before adding the mouse button , if there is no mouse button .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now , this function is enabled by clicking on the right and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . this movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt which will start the first time , but can be changed later .
when the sound appears delayed , you can reduce the response time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to sound &amp; multimedia , choose there sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ pper sound buffer you can set up at a lower value to reduce the response times .
if this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; started at each start of &amp; K@@ DE ; this function is currently only under &amp; K@@ DE ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please check out the respective documentation to find out how you automatically start a program .
set all settings on the values that were set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the button on the button , settings will be reset to the stand@@ ings after the last drop of application .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with default settings . especially the intelligent shift should be switched off first . if you get used to the automatic mouse click here , you can later move the smart shifting .
if you are using the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to decrease the response times of &amp; K@@ DE ; to decrease sounds .
first , you should be aware of what places a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window , which do not have a link , does not lead to un@@ wanted reactions . therefore , you can park the mouse at such places , until you want to use them again .
if your mouse is bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you need to pull out the mouse ball . as it happens , it is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be clear if you view the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . dirt and dirt can be scrat@@ ched easily with a flat blade or finger nails .
in very rare situations , the operating system canc@@ els the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the intelligent shift in this case , that means &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the operation can no longer be replaced by letting the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under a different window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click . herein , the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will be reset ; and you can work as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue mouse cli@@ cks and sets the cur@@ sor to another spot .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor to place where you want it . but you do not want to make use of mouse click on a neutral area of desktop if you don &apos;t want to create any extra mouse cli@@ cks . secure zones for the mouse po@@ inters are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the title lines of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent shift , but I don &apos;t make it to edit text .
the intelligent shift is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is highly possible to mark it into the cli@@ p@@ board or to add it into the cli@@ p@@ board , but it will probably only cause problems . here are some advice :
do not use the intelligent shift , if you just start to start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; Please select text instead : run a mouse click on the end of the text area and hold the switch button , while you move the mouse pointing to the other end of the text and again the mouse button .
use the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . this will happen every time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button is playing a sound like a mouse click . later you can use the intelligent shift to use without the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . however , it requires some exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; installed . that should be the case most of the system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse cli@@ cks is available only if the system has a sound card and loud@@ speaker and are set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; actu@@ ated the mouse button as soon as the mouse indicator has waited for short . this program has been developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome , and those that beg@@ ged the bri@@ dle pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured that a certain moment is waiting for a pulling @-@ operation begins before the mouse button is released . in this way , pulling and removal with the mouse can also be done .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows the dum@@ b user to talk about their computer .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; allows users to talk the computer for yourself . the user can choose from a list of conversation , pro@@ positions which are to be spoken once again .
on the first page of the assistant ( left screen ) , enter the command , which will later be used for the speech output of text . further details can be found in the description of the dialog .
on the second page you can choose the standard text box . from the text fitting , you can often choose the text matching , without having to tap into . the passages can be processed naturally .
on the third side ( right screen photo ) , you determine the dictionary for the verbal language . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can compare the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly shown and contains essentially an input field for key@@ ing your sentences ( the lower white field on screen ) and a run of the sentences already spoken ( the upper white field in the screen ) .
if you have a mouth , you can enter the phr@@ ases that you want to hear . each spoken phrase will be attached to the memory . you can select from these sets that should be spoken once again .
with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the installation dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two card cards , voice output and at@@ titudes , page address , and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language .
in the input field of the card output speech , give the command to call the language requirement . in the drop down box below the input field , you place the character encoding , containing the text to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two types of text on the text . select the check@@ box , if the text should remain unchanged as standard input to the speech generator .
if the check@@ box is not selected , the text will be given as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course , the command to speech output by your language generator depends . you can find this command in documentation to your language generator . examples are available in App@@ endi@@ x .
with possible kt@@ ops as language service is used &amp; k@@ mouth ; as first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD voice service . if this is successful , the other settings will be available for voice output and is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the option of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
by selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the key short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the menu instruction manual or in the bar for text fitting .
the chosen text passage is spoken directly with the selection of So@@ fort . additionally , the chosen text passage is transferred only to the input field initially only in the input field .
with the second drop box , the editing system for Text@@ pass@@ agen@@ buch , you can define whether the text box can be stored automatically at the closing of the editing system .
with the selection of text matching book store , the book is saved . if you choose any changes , the text box book will not be saved , select &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text box is to be saved .
the page links contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the word transi@@ tional . in the main window next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth . a select box , if this list contains more than a dictionary . with this drop @-@ down box you can choose the currently used dictionary for wor@@ d@@ ration .
with the buttons on the right you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add , order of books or export them into a file . below the list you can set up the name and select the language for the dictionary .
for this source , choose the desired language ; &amp; mouth ; reads the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation . the frequency of each word is simply determined by deri@@ vative of the occurr@@ ence . additionally , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only correct words into the new dictionary .
with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask what dic@@ tion@@ aries are collected , and how they will be weigh@@ ted .
with this option , you will create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; re @-@ issued words automatically into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary .
the main window of the window to processing text fitting is two divided . in the upper part , the text boxes are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit an selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding key code . if you have selected a text box book , you can only change its name .
promotions , such as new text matching or books , or selected texts and books can be easily accessed by selecting the menu bar , in tool@@ bar or via a folding menu .
the sequence of text fitting or text passages you can change by drag with the mouse to the new spot or with the arrow keys and the Alt ; key .
the selected text is cut out and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , it will be used otherwise , otherwise the selected areas of the system .
the selected text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , it will be used otherwise , otherwise the selected areas of the system .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in an input field , it will be used otherwise , otherwise the selected sets of the storage system .
if this menu entry is crossed , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons used for frequently used commands . by default , the tool bar is mounted directly under the menu bar . mouse click on the narrow@@ ly left side and drag can be moved to another spot .
if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow body is displayed in the lower part of the main file with references to the condition of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not cru@@ sted , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is crossed , a sliding bar for text boxes are displayed directly under the tool bar . mouse click on the narrow@@ ly left side and drag can be moved to another spot .
probably you have the command for the speech output not correct or not fully entered . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General Settings and specify the command for speech output on the card output speech . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to further details . )
Festival is a language edition system of the Edinburgh University . currently only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ isch are supported . the license allows to use the festival free of charge and spread without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the speech output , it is assumed that the file is installed in the / usr / local / festival . the command is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator . currently it supports only the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and spread without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for the establishment of the speech output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ ech@@ os file . the speech output is then possible with one of the three commands examples :
for the third example , the option has to be turned on as default entry . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . he conver@@ ts a list of Phon@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to disman@@ tle the text in Phon@@ eme . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ commercial applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text to phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax always swallowed the final sign of the text , so that an additional sign must be added . the complete order is therefore more elabor@@ ate than in the other examples :
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / / usr / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; art@@ boards / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ;
all parts of the command must be written in a line . the option is to be sent as default entry .
the speech dem@@ on of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ wide speech service , which provides all &amp; K@@ DE ; applications a standard interface for speech output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various speech output systems .
as the setting of the guide takes place only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you just need to use possible kt@@ ach@@ ts@@ d as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the installation dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully use a language generator ( and of course &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires approximately 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on the individual of your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak to spend text by the computer . it is saved as a list already saved sentences which allows users to rev@@ ise the user again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . on the computer must be a language syn@@ thesizer installed .
detailed user documentation you can find with help : / k@@ mouth ( either enter this URL into the mailing list of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start a hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the speech output system of &amp; K@@ DE ; - is an of modules existing service , which allows every application to read text on the &amp; D@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a part system in &amp; K@@ DE ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) , it provides a common application interface for &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ programm@@ ers ready to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS capabilities . also users offer interesting opportunities .
reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; Kate ; even if &amp; Kate ; in other &amp; K@@ DE ; applications embedded .
the speech output is performed via the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program , which uses various background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
allows the creation of language spending on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) about the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; help program .
in the future : support for speech @-@ up languages such as Vo@@ ice@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; speech @-@ up language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and speech @-@ up @-@ met@@ a @-@ language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the speech output of &amp; K@@ DE ; , an application without visible windows that offers T@@ TS @-@ services via &amp; D@@ bus ; offers .
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and set of kt@@ ts@@ d on kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
one module for the web browser &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a web site or parts of it .
a module for the text editor &amp; Kate ; with which a text file can be read or partially read .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( htt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) , please refer to the list of htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ n@@ .org / mail@@ . / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ n@@ .org / mail@@ . the developers can also find in IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # K@@ DE @-@ Acc@@ essibility ) .
before you register &amp; kt@@ ops , you need to install the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program and set correctly . see also
during the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as yet no speakers are set up , the card speaker is displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the card card will be indicated .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer various languages and voices , so also different male or female , or such that is described in volume or speed . you should also set up several variants for a speaker . you should at least set a speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ops , use the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher than the standard speaker .
various speakers for the same syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are comparable to several print @-@ ups for the same printer .
when you click on the card tra@@ verse speaker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card card is displayed . this will also appear automatically if you start a kt@@ m@@ gr and is not a speaker yet .
all the speakers already appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear above in the list . the top speaker is used for speech output when an application gives no speaker .
with a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the sequence of speaker in the list determines its priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
choose a voting type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a young and girls voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker appears on the card nar@@ r@@ ator . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the card and check if speech output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so the T@@ TS @-@ service of &amp; K@@ DE ; starts . see . now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; use order to create text applications and manage text applications . see .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start the speech output system by &amp; K@@ DE ; click on the card tra@@ verse general to open this card card . here you can set some general options .
mark the check@@ box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ops ; this starts to enable the card ticket orders , and you can create text orders and read it . see . remove the marking , the K@@ TT@@ SD is adjusted , and the T@@ TS system is disabled .
if kt@@ m@@ gr is terminated , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; if the box is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled .
if this check@@ box is marked and kt@@ om@@ m@@ gr automatically appears in the control bar at the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the reading is complete .
with the buttons in this row , you can start text records , break , stop and hold back again .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ cli@@ p@@ board and open a text file for reading . you can also change the speaker for an order .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings are taken on all sides .
the card ticket orders will only be displayed if K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the card and cross there voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can read the text of the displayed web@@ page . check the text that is to be read , and select in the main menu icon texts . after a short time , the speech should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web site . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pre@@ spann@@ er lines and other invisible brands are also pre @-@ read .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can read the displayed text , check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then select the text that will be read , and select in the main menu icon texts . then the speech output should start .
this also works when &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications , as &amp; eg ; in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the message system of &amp; K@@ DE ; that you will notify about of you determined events . you can read the text of these messages also by &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can set up various types of messages . you can notify &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; for example , set up that you &apos;ll be noti@@ fied when your nickname is found . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C message message .
supports a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry in the menu settings of this program . these are possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy depending on application .
filter for character encoding provide a good way to correct and correct messages ; the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is included for delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the term / local / in@@ box as it can be assumed in most cases as required .
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filter is not required .
in filtering the text is processed , before it will be sent to the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . you are useful to replace the pron@@ unci@@ ation to select false language and nar@@ rations , or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the mode of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts .
the Edition of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will be pre @-@ read to all other contracts . if the edition of the Screen @-@ Reader is read , the orders received will be continued again .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important news as &amp; eg ; processor will be too hot . a warning has priority and holds the output of news and normal text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after the issue of the warning .
News have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of a application that is used for messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a website , you can enter the room with &amp; k@@ mouth . &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ noti@@ fications are also news . read it .
the rest are simple text contracts . each order you meet from the card ticket orders , is a word order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that have been used text applications . text yields are intended for issue longer texts , which have no particular ur@@ gency .
all four orders will be processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of an Screen @-@ Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts are reading , this issue will be stopped and finished .
first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text messages as well as on &amp; K@@ DE ; messages .
filters process the text and pass it to the next filters . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there can be further types of filters .
character processors can replace parts of a text by other text . it can be delivered either as words or regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; used by text or regular expressions like : - ) by text or for the form@@ att@@ ing of messages from &amp; counter ; or &amp; mail ; in better understand@@ able form .
&amp; XML ; res@@ duc@@ ers use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program , which sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . if you have sent a female voice on the card card , you can read text from K@@ DE messages to read about .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied for a speech output . if the filter is fixed , his rules does not apply , he will remain the text unchanged at the next filters .
when a word order , a message , warning or any &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Noti@@ fication of &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent them by all activated filters , which were set up on the page below . processing through the filter is done in the list of the list below .
this shows the list of standard normal filters . if a filter is not crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be turned from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of felt , and it will be shown below the following setup dialog .
enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison list . these patterns are found in text , then the text will be exchanged in text against the corresponding replacement text . large and small friction is not considered by comparison .
specify a name for your filters . you can choose any name , it must only differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column match and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column creation . the list is displayed in the displayed sequence from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can upload a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save the current list or delete it . load a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list .
here is a language registered , the filter is only used if the speaker for the text order is one of the here registered languages . click on the button to view a list of languages . you can also hold multiple languages when using the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; press key .
if a value is registered here , the filter is used only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID @-@ running programs will get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ numbers you have to om@@ it . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the applic@@ ator ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 is available , you must only be copied .
the string mapping filter is used only on the text if all conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if match . are all input fields empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
in terms of words the character encoding filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. the words have to be limited on both sides by separ@@ ator ( space character ) .
in this manual , you will find no instructions for writing on regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; expressions &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; tit@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the box .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format in another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such formations . however , the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
specify the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is re@@ achable on the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
with the Speaker set filter , you can send text to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card speaker , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that text by k@@ mail should be read from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text to the filter , it is looking for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected according to the speaker features that send the program the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends and the characteristics of the speaker card speakers . with the Speaker filter , you can over@@ write the selected speaker .
if the filter is written here , the filter is applied if the text contains the given regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can call this with a click on the button to get help with the input .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
here , place the properties of you requested by you . if the text set up the filter conditions above , the speaker is chosen to display the desired requirements at the most . click on the button to display the dialogue selection selection .
use these buttons to store or delete all your settings or delete any settings .
the Speaker filter is only used on the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter if applicable . you must apply at least one condition .
the language version API , by &amp; K@@ DE ; with the programm@@ ers can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the language syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that it can use syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers .
the following section includes a short description of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ D@@ bus ; -@@ interface of the speech output API of &amp; K@@ DE ; the full documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the K@@ DE ; Acc@@ essibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications call for voice services via the &amp; D@@ DS ; -@@ interface from &amp; K@@ DE ; from the program kt@@ ops on the object K@@ Speech .
here is text of text to read and option a language code as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands you give .
open two &amp; counter top ; window . start a kt@@ ops in a window , then a kt@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Um@@ shap@@ er@@ filter , but not pre @-@ read using the module for festival websites .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone , so you do not have to do this if you do not need this voice to read on websites . you also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found on the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain characters or inter@@ ven@@ tional sign seem to cause errors in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so that all pro@@ positions will be ski@@ pped or just chew@@ ing f@@ wel@@ d . what can I do against it ?
first , make sure the option is adjusted to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be solved by a character encoding filter . see .

KT@@ TS is also working with each language syn@@ thesizer which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of the above languages can be in@@ complete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , drag the description of syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages . see also on the site of kt@@ ts ; according to information , which are not included in this manual .
the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses an adap@@ tive module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you wish to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the use of another syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , you get together with the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the XML ; conversion filter but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ops , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including packages of deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have to download the source codes of &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can download and translate or install the tar@@ ball at any time , please translate and install the program with the following commands :
before you cross &amp; kt@@ ts , check first if speech disp@@ at@@ cher works with your language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers right . you can use the script script SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops , which uses the program of speech disp@@ at@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed further , that the device of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is not possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is de@@ composed into single sentences . the user can go down or break down a few , repeat the output or break off .
if an application has a text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , if you have set up a speaker , it can be used for example a female English speaker . if you want a speaker , it will be used otherwise the best speaker , otherwise , if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker is selected , you can see in .
if you click on the card speaker to add , and in order to insert a speaker in the list or click Edit , the card speaker device display is shown . as an example , the module card is shown for Interactive . details on modules will be found below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path at Festival in P@@ AT@@ H is included , you just need to enter the festival .
select the character encoding for text , which is handed over to festival . in general , this setting will automatically be made . generally , Western languages are using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages like Czech or Slovak , use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , make volume , microphone speed , and pitch of synthetic language . if you cannot select a number of controllers , and this grey is shown , the settings will not be displayed .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n votes require several seconds to be loaded due to their size . if you mark this check@@ box , these voices will already be syn@@ thes@@ ized at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so it will be syn@@ thes@@ ized with much higher memory consumption ) .
if this check@@ box cannot be selected , you do not have to set up a speaker ( or just click Apply ) . see .
if this is marked by kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr the programming window is displayed . otherwise , after the start is visible only the Symbol m@@ gr in the system section , but not the programming window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if the check@@ box is marked and kt@@ ach@@ m@@ gr still runs , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . this allows you to keep the pre@@ reading or to control other times .
here are all orders in queu@@ e long , along with the application that has set the order the current status of the order , the number of sets and the straight set movement . the speaker ID meets the column ID on the card nar@@ r@@ ator .
with the buttons in this row , you can choose a full double in the order shown in the list below , pre@@ - or go back . ( but not every contract consists of several sets ) .
with one click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other card cards ) will be adopted and kt@@ ach@@ m@@ gr will shr@@ inks the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , it instead AL@@ SA , G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the Map card Audio . see also .
here only lists are listed and administr@@ ated . issues of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern , war@@ nings and messages will not appear . more information about the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts will be found in .
select the type of audio output . if a component can not be selected , it has been compiled &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the corresponding audio module , or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can &apos;t load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is used for the audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules can be displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . if you have AL@@ SA , select the PCM device here . see also
make the speaker speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % equivalent to about half and 200@@ nbsp ; % approx . double normal microphone speed . so these settings can be implemented , the SO@@ X program must be installed .
click Apply to adopt the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices comprises all PCM devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device works with you . in doubt check standard .
on this card card you can set special actions that will always be executed if the word order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of speech orders :
the Edition of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it is drawn up to all other contracts . after the edition of the Screen @-@ Reader was read , the orders received will be resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have priority a priority . this stage is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved for hot . a warning keeps the output of news and normal text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; mouth ; is an example for an application that speaks news . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a website , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth . nevertheless someone &apos;s welcome you just enter the room .
if a word order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a Screen @-@ Re@@ aders , add &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio edition into the queu@@ e .
this audio file is always played , when a normal word order is interrupted . if in@@ complete sound is active as well as introduc@@ tory message , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card card are only valid for normal text applications . there are no special actions for messages , war@@ nings and the issues of screen reproduction , if these are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ops ; K@@ Noti@@ fy news , start a kt@@ m@@ gr and click on noti@@ fications . the card information is published .
mark this check@@ box to switch the Pre@@ read of &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Dis@@ abling . if this setting is not marked , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; does not read noti@@ fications before .
if this setting is marked , messages will be noti@@ fied at which a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog appears in which you want to add the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message before , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone mentioned your nickname in an IR@@ C message .
all events , otherwise stated in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; igno@@ res .
use this drop down , to determine what &amp; kt@@ ts will do when an event happens . you have the following selection options :
if you select custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
you can insert here the properties of the required speaker . standard cho@@ oses the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the card speaker as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if there is a specific event for a specific application , it will be executed . otherwise , action for all other events of certain application is executed . as the last possibility , the action comes to tra@@ ms that was specified under standard ( all other events ) .

the speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for one voice output . this standard includes brands for control of voices , voice speed , volume level , the sex of the voice and pitch . furthermore , brands for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation of the pron@@ unci@@ ation . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are present :
you need to install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as this is the default with the SS@@ ML edition .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters ( SD@@ B filter ) . S@@ B@@ Ds must start text in single sentences , as only the first set should be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the entire word order . so you can also reset or cancel , even if the language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are not directly supported .
here you can see the pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter . in the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set up as a stat@@ utory recognition filter . you can change the settings or add another pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter , but beginners will be rounded off .
at the sim@@ pl@@ est learning to try out the installation selection by sample . switch over the card selection , change some features and check out how the speaker &apos;s selection has changed . in addition , you have to have set up some more than a speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts , which can start with the pre@@ reading , as only the first set should be processed and not the whole text that can take very long ,
you can then add text messages on the card ticket orders or break off , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal Sat@@ z@@ unlimited filter is automatically set up when you start a kt@@ m@@ gr . it can &apos;t be switched off , just be removed . change anything at that filter , unless you know what you are doing .
compare the text with a regular expression for Satan and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator@@ mark ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the pro@@ posi@@ tional sign ( Dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the pro@@ posi@@ tional sign ( Tab@@ ulated code 8 ) before filtering . please note that the standard Sat@@ z@@ lim@@ it@@ ability filter keeps the character set .
S@@ BD filter will never be applied to &amp; K@@ DE ; messages ( k@@ ening ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders .
if you have removed the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional filtering filter , you can add it again by adding the file _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file .
on the card card selection selection , you can over@@ write the check@@ box for application . the card card is displayed if
use of the standard speakers ( the top on the card speaker ) . in other words , no speakers are defined .
use of the most suitable speaker , which has all properties of a furnished speaking speaker . if you do not delete the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker is out . otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , which is the most introduced properties .
select the method for entering the desired speaking characteristics by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the requested speaker . if this feature doesn &apos;t matter , do not give anything .
mark this check@@ box , if the property should have priority in front of other features . you can also set several marks here .
since the language is a critical factor when understanding is the issue , it will always use this property . the only case you might want to specify the attribute language , if you know that a specific application is sent into another language as the language of the working environment .
to use all properties in the area speakers , using the closest to the following , click the default button , and then use the speaker , which is the closest to the following .
in this case , 0 stands for the last word order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a job number . ( no order number is required 0 ) .

before you create &amp; kt@@ ts , check first if your language syn@@ thesizer works correctly . follow the instructions that you have received with syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , whose source code is revealed . the quality of the voices is generally good and there are multiple voices and languages supported . with many voices , you can adjust volume , microphone speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions that are supplied with festival . would you like to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code from the festival . the German voices will be subject to limitations .
this voice uses Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still set in an early stage stage . un@@ zip the software in the festival / li@@ b / vocals / russian / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to set up a Ky@@ ri@@ ll@@ ische ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding like for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; Distri@@ buted as the first of your distribution &apos;s CDs .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use Russian voice , the encoding must be set to a 8 @-@ bit Ky@@ ri@@ ll@@ ama option , such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . then , the le@@ x@@ ik@@ al analysis and &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; generated from it the audio edition . the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; -@@ program and &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which allows the management of network interfaces , the routine and the DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a series of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to enable the users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the areas of &amp; net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings are displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched by selecting c@@ contro@@ l@@ centre ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their driver must already be operational and configured , thus &amp; net@@ work@@ conf ; the device is displayed at all and allows the setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed on the Inst@@ alling of &amp; Linux ; installed and furnished . network devices later added , the drivers need to be loaded by adap@@ ting the following files , according to the kernel version , are loaded :
the module network settings will be loaded when the network settings will be selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting the module network , this software automatically tries to detect the used platform on the system automatically .
if the platform can &apos;t be recognized , the variety is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and the Rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and is the best . by marking the setup no @-@ again questions can be hit permanently . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will be automatically pres@@ et .
changing the network settings is possible only in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed grey , which means settings can only be considered . in system management mode , you can access the button management mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
the overall functionality of the module is available in system management mode . this is divided into three hor@@ semen :
the tab network interfaces for administration of the system networks . all available network equipment will be displayed . from the tab network interfaces , the following tasks can be carried out :
the default network interfaces can set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the buttons interface ... set up in the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking on the set @-@ up settings shows the dialogue with further options .
the TCP / IP settings are collected by a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , TCP / IP information is provided with the start of system services . there is no further adjustment required . in the list box , there can be either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system .
you can set the TCP / IP configuration without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in an input field IP address , the required TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field , the net@@ mask is fixed .
if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alize the network interface for boats . if the initi@@ alization is not requested , this option should not be activated .
the values in this dialogue are displayed as features of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . if you have already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP address . with ping in the &amp; console , you can determine whether the required address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network equipment can be activated or switched off . switching on an off network device with selection from the list and click interface to activate ....
network equipment can be activated or switched off . activate a activated network device with selection from the list and click interface de@@ activate ....
the computer address of the host is fixed in the local sub@@ net which medi@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is provided by default to TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub@@ networks .
if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network where the Gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name through the respective IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer is required to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , the DNS c@@ ates this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3,@@ 4@@ 3,@@ 67@@ 8,@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator on the name solution part of the horse &apos;s name solution enables simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed pre@@ .@@ DNS entries can be arranged by selecting a paper or exec@@ uting in the list with the buttons or her@@ under in the priority .
by clicking on the button adding ... from the machine calcul@@ ator , a DNS Server can be added . it will be added to the dialog New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then add the button . the entry is then inserted in the list .
from the group computer to name resolution , select one entry and then click on the button Edit .... It is displayed in the dialog Edit .
the list of well @-@ known hosts describes the user name @-@ to @-@ IP address references to TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when there are no DNS servers . in small , enclosed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
normally the list of well known hosts contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses . these still existing version of IP should still be replaced in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click Add ... The dialog New alias is being displayed .
enter the name of the well @-@ known computer and add the button . if the well @-@ known hosts has several alias names , the button is adding several times and enter the further alias names .
select an associated host account from the list and select Edit .... The dialog called Calcul@@ ator is displayed .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then by clicking OK , the list of static hosts is updated .
the settings shown in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system . in order to enable the changes , the command needs to be set in one &amp; counter ; the following command needs to be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; K@@ DE ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the completed version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in one &amp; counter ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool with graphic surface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of their distribution can be used .
for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE ; not only , but additionally the development packages with libraries and other things are needed .
this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; net@@ work@@ conf ; you should comp@@ ile these commands .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about fundamental network technology are given , in the second all of &amp; net@@ work@@ conf ; alter@@ able configuration files are discussed .
this area can &apos;t replace further knowledge on IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information is medi@@ ated on the integration of PCs into a small ( home ) network .
currently IP networks operate with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 5 has never found large spread . IPv6 is expected to see in the near future . this description focuses on widespread IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge which IP address is allocated to a network interface . in foreign networks , am &amp; eg ; workplace is the response agency that can be used a valid IP address or if available , can be DH@@ CP . definitely the IP address can &apos;t be chosen freely !
when setting up a own small ( home ) Network work , the IP address is chosen from a specially reserved area for this purpose to avoid IP address accounts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded to the Internet , so its use is possible .
of course , access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateway .
for smaller networks , you usually use addresses in the range of 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the range is large for networks up to 250 machines .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all the hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.@@ 0 and 12@@ 7@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = its own host ) . the standard route is required for the IP for@@ warding .
the network address 12@@ 7@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this section , the configuration files , which are affected by &amp; net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes altered in DSL connections , so it is not surprising when in case of active DSL connections to find another content than defined there .
for &amp; SuSE ; it is known that this file is ab@@ orted by scripts in search of sub@@ SE@@ config . another state can be expected .

it appears the standard K@@ DE ; -@@ print dialog . if you choose , check out that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the printing dialog .
print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who possess expanded per@@ missions .
cr@@ on , for example , vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; cr@@ cr@@ on ; uses the c@@ ron@@ tab to change the sched@@ ules of the user .
a PO@@ SIX @-@ compliant &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands by &amp; UNIX ; to experience time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a f@@ use program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the ability to create multiple archives on a tape . the first target was to create a surface for tar , which presented the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar to fast , selective un@@ packing . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife : how much longer takes it when you feel ?
before a band can be used , it must be bound by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; spin the band back and read the pre@@ ten@@ sion@@ ing information of the tape . recogni@@ zes &amp; k@@ dat ; the band on the band will not be asked if the band is form@@ at@@ ted .
recognise &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ fix , search it according to the appropriate index on your disk . can &apos;t be found , you will be asked whether the band @-@ index is to be re@@ created .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol changed for the tape drive to indicate that the band is included . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the tape can now be searched for the band .
before throwing the tape , first the integration must be solved . there are three methods to evaluate this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; indicates a modification of the symbol for the band that the integration of the band was solved and shows a corresponding message in the Status Bar . the band can now be cast out without danger .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat it can be used , it must be form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a band species have to form@@ at@@ ted before saving data can be used . this process does not conform to the form@@ att@@ ing at &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not have to be form@@ at@@ ted before it can be form@@ at@@ ted before using the band of &amp; k@@ dat . flo@@ ppy drives are usually form@@ at@@ ted by the tape of the band , DA@@ T drives by contrast .
after entering the band name and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ att@@ ing of the band . all data on the tape are lost ! after completion of the form@@ att@@ ing process , the band will be automatically bound and is ready to use .
before using the backup process , you must select the saf@@ est files . this can be done on three types :
select one file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or file is secured .
mark a f@@ ass@@ ment profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
mark files in the local file tree with a her@@ ring . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder will be secured .
click with the mouse button on the local file tree and pick up in the menu ...
once the backup was initiated , the settings will open for backup . in this dialogue , you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
when you confirm the settings , the dialog appears . the dialog shows the progress of the securing process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
mark one file or folder in one of the archives on the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
mark the files in one of the archives of the band with a her@@ ring . only the marked files and / or sub@@ folder are checked .
click using the mouse button in one of the archives and select the check @-@ in inspection ....
once the testing procedure has been started , the dialog settings for review . in this dialogue , you can check your selection and change the work folder for checking .
if you confirm the settings for checking , dialogue appears . this dialogue shows the progress of the test process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
before introducing the restore , the files which are to be restored will be marked . this can be made on two types :
select a file or folder in one of the archives which belong to the tape drive . it will only be restored the selected file or sub@@ folder .
mark the desired files from one of the archives with a her@@ ring . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder will be restored .
right click on a file or a folder in one of the archives and select in the menu .
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog settings for recovery . in this dialogue , you can check your selection and change the work folder for recovery .
if you confirm the settings for recovery , the dialog appears . this dialogue shows the progress of the recovery process , as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to recre@@ ate the tape inde@@ x@@ file using the band@@ in content . this process will delete all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the volume :
this will create a f@@ ass@@ ment profile with the straight selected files and default settings . you can pre@@ fix the following settings for a f@@ use profile :
the current work folder in which the f@@ use is to be done . the list of noti@@ fy@@ ory files is automatically updated accordingly to the selected working folder .
for all folders that are listed under backup files , that only the files are stored on the same file system , like the folder . folders that are on other file systems can be installed separately under the file system . each entry is viewed from tar regardless of the other file system files .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files are secured , which have changed since then .
the name of the file , which is used to determine changes since last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file from the tar . this causes all files to be secured and create a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; lt ; LT ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings you can set up using the menu option K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be presented :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path must refer to non @-@ re@@ winding version of the band device .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; co@@ dat ; before the tape is attached , the command is loaded to the drive . if some drives is necessary , it may be performed before reading or write operations .
if the option is switched on , track &amp; dat to lock the ej@@ ection mode . possibly , this attitude does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is switched on , the band@@ aging is switched off by &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically dis@@ connect the tape . do not use this option at flo@@ ppy stre@@ amer .
if the option is switched on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ war@@ time block size for the tape drive . doesn &apos;t matter whether this setting is active or not , you must notify &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your band drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ at@@ ted , it is writing a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only prove a memory block on the tape . the content of the file describes as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is the host name : seconds , where the host name is the full name of the system on which the tape was form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have been form@@ at@@ ted since the ep@@ och .
the band ID is used to find a file named in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file in the same name .
the remaining files on the band are pure tar - archives that can manage directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it does not act in incre@@ mental f@@ uses .
check the contents of a backup band . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ viewer for system protocols . the program is appropriate for un@@ experienced users , where you can get information about your system or where the system allows you to get information about your system , experienced users for quick access , for example , on problems related to their server .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the program is appropriate for un@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system is depos@@ ited the different protocol files .
furthermore , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; experienced users the quick access to information about problems that can appear on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; therefore , try to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and evaluated by certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; a number of useful features include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included , and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen photo , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; functions available , with the help of the individual protocol lines of a protocol @-@ file easily filtering and sort . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start tries &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol doesn &apos;t show you , and it opens up with system administr@@ ators . the protocol files are usually not listed under Linux in the file / var / log , for normal users usually don &apos;t have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter out after a selected crit@@ eri@@ on or according to the selected filters . in the default setting , the selection box is displayed next to the selected filters . then a protocol @-@ line will only display , if included in one of the columns &apos;s string search engine is displayed .
you can also select another record at this point . the string search engine will then select the column process , and in addition , in the protocol mode , select the column process , and carry out this in the filter bar named a process , so show you &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; all protocol lines have been sent or created by this process .
this option is activated in default settings and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a striking color as the protocol @-@ lines of the stage indication . the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched off .
if you want to show only certain processes ( for example , in the system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , you can then find the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example , if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the launch of Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use the filter bar .
in addition , you can turn the option to new lines jump in the context menu of the main file system to display all new added protocol lines .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; enables you to use multiple protocol files into separate sub@@ types . to open this feature , use the entries in the menu to open up additional windows and to manage . once you have selected a window , select a Protocol for viewing .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / ks@@ ystem@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ .@@ D@@ ort you will find further current information on the cat@@ ch@@ ment of &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; you will also find in the following folders of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Subversion archive : ks@@ ystem@@ log ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Archive
welcome to &amp; K@@ DE ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the V In@@ it system evol@@ ves quickly for the control of the program starts at the high drive of the system in &amp; Linux ; because it is easier to use , more powerful , and more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I will not go further on historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to set up a machine on System V In@@ it without any re@@ installation and re @-@ format . that &apos;s why you need to be sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was one .
the SY@@ S@@ V In@@ it also differs from BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for every system service which you would like to run at the high drive of the system or change on any other run @-@ level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; System services , not such as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be on one hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you need it . most systems possess this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also want to run a r@@ c.@@ conf / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something with the serial connection .
the kernel is looking for in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first he finds .
the standard run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line as the following :
at this point you can throw a glance into the second column and probably determine that the default is run @-@ level 3 . if you want to change it , then you can change / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab by hand and the 3 change . if you do something through it , then you can repair it by restart the system and run the following :
but how does it start to start the right scripts ? if you enter -@@ l enter into r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following :
you will notice that no real files are in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how starts and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is written thus that there is an argument such as start and stop . you can actually start this script by hand on the command line :
this would read the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it includes a K , the script will stop with the argument stop . if it includes a S , the script will start with the argument .
some people desire a simple way to establish machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server @-@ level , which can only run htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc . furthermore , I could also have a user -@@ Run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc .
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or other hand @-@ device is easy to not say tri@@ vial : just draw an entry from the range of the available system services on one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop to stop ) .
you can also change scripts between Run@@ lev@@ eling or change the position within one level by removing it somewhere else . however , the entry of its original R@@ une level ( or its position ) is removed . this only happens if they withdraw an entry from the range of the Available system services .
note : entries are post@@ pon@@ ed if you select this into a new area . to copy only to a new Run@@ level , you need to choose from the menu Edit or select from the context menu , and even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action .
sometimes the sort of details can not be calculated sometimes . in such a case you must edit the numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to add system service .
note : there are currently no possibility to restore entries that were thrown into the tr@@ ash bin . be careful .
you can use the tab button to activate the various working ranges ( Available System Services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) and the cur@@ sor keys to meet a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry into another Run@@ level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to manually change the registration number or the name of a entry , press the tab button to switch between different fields . connect the button by typ@@ ing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to dis@@ card the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) , if they are available . otherwise , changes are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ lev@@ eling and now starts the machine permanently . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO @-@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the standard run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; designed to run under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way , how system services are started in these distri@@ butions , is simplified the configuration for proprietary intervention programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately is not standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v are planning an expansion of the program for this approach .
in case you are using any other distribution : please check if all configuration files are available , which are required by their respective system service ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) just cancel without news if their configuration files are not present or wrong .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using any other distribution , please send us more information about Run@@ level , so that this manual may be added .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program , you can manage users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adap@@ tion of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made changes , you need to save this . either you use the corresponding symbol of tool@@ bar or record save in the menu file .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , the user and the users list . select the desired user or the desired batch with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialog user and group properties .
some card cards are displayed only if you have activated advanced system settings . only if you can create space constra@@ ints ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , you will be able to register individual settings , if you can install individual settings , if shadow passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD uni@@ boxes are installed .
the password management card appears if shadow passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d , like in BSD , can be installed .
this card card is activated only if for at least a single file system limitation ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ zable at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , there can be changed for any user parameter , where the limits are available in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected using the field file system .
the card groups inform@@ s about the group of selected users . the default group , to which the user is heard , you will find in the Pri@@ mary Group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by signing this in the big field .
the dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , mark this user in the list .
to add a user or a group , select &quot; User or Group &quot; or click the matching Add button of tool@@ bars . editing or delete the selected user or the selected group is an@@ alog@@ ous .
with this module you can install the L@@ ILO @-@ boot manager , remove the boot loader , remove and change the time up to the standard operating system , remove the default operating system , remove , change , change , and more .
