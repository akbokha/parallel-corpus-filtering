<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only part of the entire & URL is translated.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. Babelfish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, translations of translations make no important decisions depending on the translation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the internet can be translated. other text should be translated to the Babelfish side itself, where you can directly insert text directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains different modules for & Konqueror; in spite of their low size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of & Konqueror; by making these easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">For further information about using & Konqueror; and the built-in functions you can find in the manual for & Konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To set up these modules in & Konqueror; set up settings, set up the card tools and select the required modules here.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list with standard setup modules from the KDE; Addons package. please note that you may have more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package that includes & Konqueror; contains before using this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in & Konqueror; click on Extras. then you can view the page that has brought & Konqueror; to crash, if present, delete.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module filters (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & Konqueror; menu bar under extras. with the module you can filter & Konqueror; 's current work directory on different way filters.</seg>
<seg id="12">To view the DOM construction supervision in & Konqueror; select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM which is currently displayed. as default, the display starts with the root notes of the document, for example: an element, all other nodes are subelements of this root canal.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & Konqueror; provides a further view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory on local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various symbols and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The particularity of & FSView; consists of showing-called folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree-Map. each object is shown by a rectangle, its area is proportionally to its size. this size must possess the property that the sum of the size of the subordinate objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView; determines the size of a file or folder, with the size of a folder as the sum of the size of entries is specified. in this way, large files can be easily detected if they are far below in the folder hierarchy. in that way, & FSView may be regarded as a graphic and interactive version of the & UNIX; -command can be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treemap-representation is a rectangle, which represents a file or file in your file system. to simplify navigation possess the rectangle of meaningful colour and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The colour of a rectangle, which is switched over color mode, can be either depth for the easy detection of screws or the picture of any other file association like name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different characteristics of the respective file or folder. for each property, you can define if there is enough space to display, or if the area of subordinates can be used, or if the surface of subordinates may occur. furthermore, you can define the relative position of the labeling in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">At installation algorithms for Treemaps should the rule be observed that the surface is proportional to size of the entry. at the Treemap in & FSView, this goal is not always held. note that less space is not available for frame entries, if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As the arrangement of a entry was done to the subordinate entries, the implementation will be left to it. here, it is necessary for labelling and to avoid placements by framework increasingly beneficial the areas that are possible to be square. the best methods of this are lines, columns or recursive second-allocation.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can designate the minimal surface for an entry on the menu entry. instead, a Rautenpattern is drawn in the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally & FSView was originally designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widgets that was developed for the use of KCachegrind.</seg>

<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by using Compact & Flash; Memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. the camera will then appear as a record drive. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digitization; uses the program gPhoto2 for communication with digital cameras, which has an constantly increasing number of more than 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol, which has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to host and other peripherals without the need additional driver.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the calculator. since photos in general are large files and transmission over the serial port, this connection is now deprecated. & digitization; supports these cameras and execute the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras will be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support has been designed to read the preview pictures of digiplug. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you might not be able to see any examples that could possibly be possible or the creation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things to & digicame; is how easy to extend its functionality by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image plugins interface Project (manual) is a joint module structure for & digitization;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide modules with all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way, as it can also be a user. your advantage is that it is much easier, & digitization; by writing a small module to complement one function, as the changes in & digitization; even carry out themselves.</seg>

<seg id="149">I dare to claim that if you don't have any more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you will not know how many photos you have, then you will definitely not & digitization;. the approach to save metadata both in a database and in the image files are guaranteed very fast searching and secure archiving that you can access to other programs, platforms, and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you do and know before you need something in your system is the structure information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must be organized somehow on your computer. you need to decide if you want to store them on a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; please make sure you need to switch to a bigger drive.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you'll be happy with this structure. holiday images can be found quickly across your location. if you make enough photos, then you will be subfolder as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. you can then download a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, work processes, constant supply of pictures to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will not be able to organize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the stacking processing easier. split new files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplified a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also suggest the metadata option in the installation page of metadata in & digitization; this ensures that Exif- and IPTC data can be written into the file. if you forget, then you can also store the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the respective point in the menu album.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change that? to this, & digitization; they provide a metadata Editor for a number of selected attribute. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now start the real work, as you need to refer to any picture of words, labelling and evaluation. of course, you can set all images that need the same attribute and set the value then. you start the best with the rating or shear. that makes sense when you can concentrate on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now continue with keyword, keywords, how to continue using other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import cataloguized images from another source with embedded maverbial, then the pictures attached to you can create the pictures attached to the right place. the subsort of hierarchy in the tree is no problem and can easily go through the drag of a subtree to another. the changed keywords are followed by & digitization; updated while the subtrees are persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is overcut. this is a very rough representation, as each block of metadata in truth consists of many sections. file names and calendar data are characteristics of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the words - the next section refers to inscriptions, or comments, the third important tool to catalogise your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to see most of your photos only, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. you are sure to be interested in your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance it is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look closer, then catch some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this is the Landeplatz of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in French Normandy 60 years after landing. Wow! one starts to dreaming, associations, the historical period of time is present, you may even hear the silence. so the labelling has completely changed your perception of this panoramic view.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who consider your photos, the title may be more important than the picture itself to create a story. if you show images, you should tell a story. remember, the key is the meaning of the viewer to help Him to help you understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect, if it's the strength only with a labeling for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digitization; you can also export a lot of text in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8) as a sign. you can even expose it for a selection of images at the same time. if you are able to expose your images into the labels and / or the title of the Web-gallery system. so you don't have to tell the story for the opening act.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the time before GPS? when you had to find in another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet before Googleam? good, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now goes with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of geolocalisation are already innumerable and will be able to recreate your travels through pictures with geographical data. & digitization; also, KML files can also be able to open your voyages. you can also export the photos at the reception. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the Google Maps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word-game with copyright and describes the practice of copyright to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all modified versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tell you what information came in the setup page of & digitization; when information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for writer and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the photographers, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographers, for example, the name of a company or organization should be used. after which this value was saved, it should not be changed. this field does not support semicolons as a separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author's title (synonym for the editor): linked to the author. examples of this field may be the title of the photographer. examples include: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a note to the author's field, this field has to be filled.</seg>
<seg id="174">Editors (synonym for vendors): use the Anbieterfeld to identify who this photo. if the photographer has been listed for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here. if the picture is a picture photo, the picture shows the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although these have no protection against misuse. everyone who has no more than basic knowledge in work with calculator, can delete or modify. the solution for this problem is digital watermarks. for professionals and Halb professionals this protection is very important to this.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & digicame; in the near future, a module for the stacking processing is available.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: turnal errors, turnouts, power poles, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, desaster flection, life time, temperature, data size, widespread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs on the road or fire. this kind of losses are the same which can also happen to you with traditional paper photos or negatively. in this section, there are problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics which has a data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, you need to buy these cautious DVDs and you can't buy more than a few years. of course you can also claim CDs and DVDs in archive quality. there are offers on gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself. whether you believe it lies in your dimension game.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you can use good discs and good recording devices and keep them on the right way. however, the best DVD capture are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you are writing a lot of reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to mistakes, even if you have just written a control mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we needed for formatting and control of control. despite this massive protection it consists of chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs there is a favourable program called IsoBuster which seems to work with CDs and DVDs, but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications that damaged data from damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to win the FormatWar against HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. everything was said to CDs and DVDs, of course also for the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device on high-quality media in a not propriated format. read the media with a description, date & author license and then in a clean, dark dry and before animals protected place. do not forget to copy the data onto the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Dismanufacturers keep your statistics for themselves. their manufacturers include a new disk, but not the data. Google represents a major field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives available: disagreement study</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: Disks keep the longest when you are operated in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C. in lower temperature control, the common failure rate increases. some of SMART provided bugs which are imminent. these are especially readers and shifting counter. the expected life time is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete losses due to overvoltage. of course you can also have data loss due to a blackout before you have secured the files, but these losses can normally be restored without huge problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices does not account much, it looks different at devices with computer chips and high-speed processes, these can cause heavy damage. at your computer, these anomalies can cause any loss of data, hardwarage, dismantling motherboards and other defects. protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against electricity points is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that is absorbed part of energy storage and the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug-bar. remember that not each outlet also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should pay attention to the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also ensure that it protects the protection against lightening, ensuring that it protects the right devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">As a overvoltage of any cable can be used on your computer, you should also ensure that all peripherals can be connected to your system. some manufacturers represent overvoltage grids which also provide a phone connection for your modem. others provide connectivity options for the coaxial cable of cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are designed specifically for notebooks, and they also contain the protection for the modem. so you are ideal for the road.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection your system protects your system prior to smaller fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a few seconds can result in the loss of adverse data. it can therefore be useful in an unbreakable electricity supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting overspannings, these devices can automatically shut down your data and run the system. some models allow them to go back up to the current. if you get a UPS, you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the included software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Concerns the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and and compare its security at electricity due to this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can be used for less than 1 euro; 20. this is only a small price difference if you think about how well your computer is to be protected. at the end, you should always remember all the cables before you go to holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service. using the right configuration, you can use this as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup target for your software. Google shared storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">Compared to the hard drives at home, however, very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send the data via the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore suitable for a solution to a local data loss of the most important pictures. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a common backup solution. therefore, it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services available on photos. their free memory is limited to 1 GB. the professional version provides you more, in case of Flickr dramatically more. for $25 a year you get unlimited memory, which should be verified in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically adjusted, thanks to the TCP protocol, and with the large firms use a backup and a partial memory. so, they are safe.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the calculator. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the filesystem support and btrfs make at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that you don't tell you that when a transmission error occurred. all these disturbances remain undiscovered until you have no protection in your computer. nobody seems to have thought about it. the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data way than you have in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable net parts are a further source of transmission losses, as they generate interest frequencies within the data stream. in normal file systems these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes each year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS by Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle it at low level and is highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched its own initiative with his btrfs filesystem. this is still in Alpha status. it uses the same protection mechanisms that use zfs and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in notebook and 46% for worktop systems. Notebooks, the share of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss based on viruses is less widespread than most points. it is currently limited to less damage, such as theft piles or newinstallationen, and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under Linux; no longer has been sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS in order to give the common file systems. a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: incorrectly, only the speed of the investigating process during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not completely filed before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: false, theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Digital cameras are 1-2 bubble settings from fundamental physical limits. it is meant that while the technology is further developed, there is a natural border for this progress. sensitivity and space characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixelsensors. even though this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the final result is more deteriorating. even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10-12 Megapixel. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB disk drive you today for 100 & euro; so don't make anyone responsible for any data loss. so, you can assure your data often following a plan and test this back before you make something dangerous like the reinstallation of your operating system, exchange plates, or the size change of hard disks.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses on an external SATA drive daily. if, then one day, a lightning strikes you're lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster suggests local and destroys a lot. forget plane crash: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the whole house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, Desasterers always means a non-local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs to the neighbouring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as mentioned above is a common cause for a data loss despite guard the panic. if you have a backup which is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be secured. it is a moment without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiating: a backup of the files changed since last time has been changed. this creates a complete moment of time to two points: the complete backup and the final differentiation.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental safeguarding: a backup of the files have been changed since last fuse. this can restore the original status to any time again. this backup comes with a versioning system on the next with the exception that it is only unchecked and not continuously.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that can easily be installed on your machines. in contrast to script-controlled FTP sessions, or other kinds of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of files that have been really changed. this happens when you want to increase safety over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Assure important images directly after you saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach allows you enough time to discover losses and recover. at the same time you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly moment for at least one month and a moment for each month. every other thinner should be done manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, in the image file saved IPTC information, associated XMP files, original retained, memory, scalability, media, relocate images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment..., use of the internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they are interested in your childhood or adolescence, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is foreseeable because of your nature, you must consider what is said today. unfortunately, there is no other option than a certain vigilance. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself as the current system is backward. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. if you have an old system that is important for reading your images, then store it and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, memory and fuse technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay in open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the professional pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size. this is actually always enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let us assume that you have set the scalability with you and the area you want to zoom on a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems such as & linux; you can copy this section and put it on a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">With the command dmesg if your new record has been recognized by the system, but do not impose it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& Breakfast; dd if = / dev / SDB, the new record is / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate in MBgt; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS & dollars; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of ReiserFS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day, no software can read it, then you can create it yourself. this task will be easier by year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format which disappears slowly from the market. therefore, you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard for GIF, but it can save a much more. it is lossless, supported XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata for improved color instruction on heterogeneous platforms, but not as many as TIFF and has a slow compression. this format would we recommend to save your images.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as a picture format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression salesgm (Deflate). however, it requires very large files. with some cameras, you can save your pictures in this format. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a licensed-free and open resource format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG is now available on the need for the use of metadata. it is now available on the TIFF / EP format and we hope to use the competitor Canon and Nikon too sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is probably one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. file information is provided with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; saved the file format for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive in front of your photo, mostly in the raw format, as it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can be used to problems with the link between the metadatendatei and the image file. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as container and put everything there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization that support for completely compatible online metadata standards, which includes a wide range of purposes and modelling, discussions and community work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and reconnaissance efforts to achieve an extensive acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. so long the images are available on the camera system, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert Rohfiles to DNG and save them in your resource archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine editing you can use external programs. if you get the images again with & digitization; edit, then you should add the metadata. these were cut off by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. just export them in Webgaleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact page, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digitization; in the section adding a photos to an album, you can add a description as you can already have to add on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you many more advanced settings for importing pictures to your album keys.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digitization; to use, connect these with the computer, turn the camera on display mode and turn them. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, try to connect with your camera. if the connection is made, a hegeant indicator appears at the bottom. if this is the case, the file name and a symbol for file association settings are displayed. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for file association settings are displayed. if this is the case, photos, movies, music etc. are displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you can download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information to each entry. with the sidebars properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the characteristics of a entry or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and photo information to be stored on the camera. a symbol shows that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have any information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider metadata shows the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer notice, GPS etc. this information is the same as with the metadata side bar from the main window of & digitization; or the image processing. note that these metadata is not available with some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then download the selection of All. this invites all photos from their camera to an album in & digitization; and we would recommend to check if the pictures have been downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can only select the default selection methods of & KDE; you can download the button and then download chosen. the button is chosen as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, a new option is available to download. these pictures have been downloaded from & digitization; in this case, the new pictures have been selected with a star in the preview window. if you select this option, only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you can download or download the buttons, see a dialogue with which you can select the target album in which the photos are stored. the list of existing albums is sorted, displayed in the section My Albums. then select the target album out of the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After choosing the target album, press OK, and & digitization; downloads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete it from the camera. you can all delete all of you by using the button Delete All. if you want to delete it, then you have to delete it first and then delete the reset selection.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no possibility that you have deleted from the camera. if you are not deleted from the camera, you should carefully check whether the photos are successfully removed in a & digitization; if you want to completely delete it from the camera, if you want to completely delete the camera system, because this is considerably faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as a filename for the photos frequently not particularly meaningful name. the file names are usually removed after you upload photos from different recording studios in the same album. therefore, it can be useful, the date and time when the picture has been made to integrate into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for rotating and mirror-based signatures. if you use this last option, you will automatically generate a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transmission opens three additional options, which are carried out before the photos are stored on the plate. if you select this, the corresponding entries from the Exif information is copied to the IPTC fields. with the last option, you can correct the date and time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want a different file format than the default format, you can use the Prefix Photo-% Y-% -% d% H:% M:% S option. turn the option date and time. for more adaptations, you should read the help of the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera file name, you have the possibility to change the filenames in lowercase. or in case letters, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digitization; used for a photo, is displayed below the name, which the camera is available in the preview. your settings for renaming will be stored and automatically used when you open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digitization; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the time of recording. not all cameras present this information. in the section side bar metadata, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded into the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is turned on, and if your camera does not deliver this information, and when you want to turn off this information, use the button and select the automatic rotation and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera has been made available about the date at which the photo was made available, you can use & digitization; this information is based on the image data. all pictures with the same date will be loaded into the same sub-album. not all cameras offer this information available. in the section side bar meta-data you can read what information your camera could be embedded into the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case you'll need to switch off directly in the target album. if you want to change this option, you'll need to install this option. use the button Advanced and choose the option date-based signatures at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from their hosts on your camera is to download. then select High upload dialog & KDE; in which you can select the files you are uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & KDE; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the picture selection is done, ask & digitization; you, where the images should be loaded up. a folder box dialog for the camera will be released. select the desired folder and press OK to upload the uploading. the pictures are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as general term in this document. thus, a position is meant to be displayed in longitude and latitude and can be displayed on a map. the identification of the data can be carried out by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographs, it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographic location. not everyone uses a plane to cartographs an area by automatic recording of the GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural office and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you haven't forgotten where exactly the photo was made, you can open a browser which shows the area. if you want to locate a postcard to another & digitization; users want to locate the site of the photos, or simply use this aspect, it is well to enrich the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how does the GPS data get into the picture? first you should know that exiv2 has supported many GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle and map referencing. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via a reproduction of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module to the geographic subordination (manual) and last about the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is no camera, which has an integrated GPS unit. but there are some who work with GPS receivers together. either as a card module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be saved with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you need to save these data in GPX format as this is the only format supported by the module to geographic mapping.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract the data from images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux. do: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you want to know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the pre-configured coordinates created by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European street types. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>

<seg id="284">Action can be selected on a set-up preview or edit image editing. you will therefore display the default behavior of & digitization; firm, if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization number and data protection data. these data will automatically be selected to the appropriate IPTC data fields when the option is selected when downloading the camera box. this data is also written to the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author's title is a synonym for the editor: this field should be the number of professional photographers, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description to the car field, this must be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for vendors: use this field to specify the photo. this must not be the author, as such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be registered here. if the picture is a warehouse, then the group or agency will be available here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data into the appropriate IPTC rim. this means that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of & digitization; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported; imported without lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Images as embedded dumplings (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments which you can read to your photos, with the images embedded in the pictures. attention: in pictures, which are already shadled, these can be overwritten by & digitization; overwritten.</seg>

<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Refresh to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings for the luminance of & digitization; can be set on this page if possible. however, if you then open the luminance, these settings will be switched on. some pictures have different sizes and the synchrone mode. if you have one, then you can only get on fast computers. if you have one, then you can get a better start results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing is using a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer another color, you can use it here. you can use the toolbar if you use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or brighter colour in the picture. these colors can be specified here. in the image processing, this picture mode can be switched and switched off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling is meant that the images are coded in higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for the immediate explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this surgery reduces the image quality because PNG requires a loss-free algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression. it means a low and 9 high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">Using the TIFF-files option, you can switch the Deflate -compression salgrope for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality since the defect is lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the adjustment of lossless JPEG 2000 files you can save lossless. even if you've posted the loss of loss, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not yet supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digitization; the image processing is only one image viewing for photographs. currently, it develops rapidly to one tool to manipulation your photos. with this dialogue, you can change the settings of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default is that all green pixels are equal to ultraviolet light. if you use this option, this problem produces a minimal loss of details. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option displays the image a little soft, eliminates the 2x2 slide pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">When this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic colour balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white is not set. standard is to use a fixed color balance, which was photographed on a white map which was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD's SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that submitting images in four steps get more details in the trotter. for other cameras this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard it is the shattering, so the parts of your images are burned down, because of the inability of your camera starts to catch a sharp white in the settings. the setting colors create some unusual results because it shows the resins in various rosemones. lastly, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the ressources.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general isn't so quickly lepers like green and red. & dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red-percentage from the still non-saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">When you select the option, you get the possibility to set a level. here's a value of three a compromise and / should be customized for each image individually.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the luminance value according to your taste. you'll probably have to set him somewhat higher than the standard 1. but this can also be done later in the image options of the digitization; -image editing will be done. in order to keep the time for humiliation, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demo site algorithm is a digital picture process, to calculate a complete picture from the partial image data that have many cameras and that provides a Matrix colorless pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA-interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digicame; and Dcraw provide three alternatives to your disposal: Bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD Interpolation. however, according to some tests it was created. VNG-Interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm created by Dcraw. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color variance of your lenses, you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a different color correction, as it is carried out during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions like this to be given. there are also LCMS and & digicame; information like the colour formations of a colour space in the others are to be translated as closely as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when a picture opens in image processing / color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Browse the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you want to store all of your profiles. & digitization; check out these folders during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have here the opportunity & quot; default squot; for your profiles. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. only your images are not managed by the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be used to the camera makers and model that included. not all profiles are included in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain any colour mapping or ammammable error. currently, dcraw Gamma does not have to be found for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you need to carry the paint mapping themselves.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft Proof profile, with which you can emulate how your image would be given a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors may be very satisfied as your camera and some colors may be very saturated, instead of leaving on blind algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious what colour profile is for you for what is intended for. unfortunately, there is not a table of cameras and profiles to fit together. this answer is of course unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profiles expands the style for the target: F for an accurate style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & KDE; Image Plugin Interface. it is an interface supported by a number of & KDE; image viewing and image processing is supported. by using this interface, & digitization; many modules support, which have been written to cooperate with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules you want to use and these are then downloaded from & digitization; these modules appear as new entries in the main menu and in addition, you will find some also in the context menu of the pretext.</seg>
<seg id="323">The short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set up in the menu under settings.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) over KIPI modules, you can get via the KIPI project via http: / / www.kipi-plugin .org or to the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The gashau settings should be easy to understand. the upper regulator cover the time between the image transitions, usually are 4-5 seconds good. the other cross fields switch on the metadata, respectively, which are displayed at the bottom of the pictures during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show a list of all currently supported cameras. on the right side there is a button automatic detection, which is trying to identify a camera that is connected to the computer. these are the port settings. currently there are serial, USB- and USB / FireWire mass storage.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom of the bottom, you can set the path for USB- and Firewire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active when you have a USB- or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera box. you have to set the path here, / mnt / camera or / mnt / cursor, specify on your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digitization; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, turn it into the display mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out whether & digitization; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera odell and port manually. after you have installed your camera, your camera will appear in the menu camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any designation for your camera. this is displayed in the menu's cameras. if you own more than one camera, you can insert all of you here.</seg>

<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digitization; you will find more information about this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digitization; includes a quick image processing with some base tools. you can use these to view your photos and to correction and improvement. image editing can be launched by a click with the left mouse button of the preview of a picture or the context menu of the My details / Edit menu.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to enhance your pictures. some of them are available as modules in & digitization; available so under circumstances no part of your distribution. you will find more information about the KIPI modules in the section image processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">One status line at the lower edge of the window, the file name, current file names, magnifying factor and current picture size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge, including the toolbar for quick access to the most commonly needed functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The processing functions of image editing change your photos. however, no of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or Save the button Save the tool bar. note that you can't recover the original photo as soon as you saved the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">You might need to make a copy of your image before you change it. you can save you using File Save As.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you can't stored the photo, you can restore the original picture by using the File Station, or restore the button the button to restore image processing in the toolbar. you then lose any change that you have done on the photo since last time.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any action of image processing can be reversed or restored. the last action can be reversed by selecting or reinstate using the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should make the keyrings, Ctrl; -z for reversing and remove Ctrl; -Umschalt-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; if you push the back or restore button in the tool bar, press a moment longer, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu agreements, all actions in between also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you start the image processing, you can move between the photos on the same album or the same keyword, by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, picture high, picture down or the entries in the menu file. if you have any changes on the current photo, you will be asked whether you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can in the photo and zoom out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the Ansilicate menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a picture to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: an extension factor automatically select</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Image mode shows the photo in full screen mode. if you don't want this, you can also change the toolbar. if you don't want this, you can call it from the & digitization; main window. see the section on setting the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print the image file, select the Standard & KDE; print dialog. you can customize the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or whole sentences. you just need to select images with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export print assistant. if you follow the assistant, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digicame; main window has a sidebar on the right edge, the important information and promotions available for the selected images. the same sidebar is available, also available in image processing. it is displayed if one of the five riders will be clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clippers, on the same tab, lets the sidebar appear or disappear again into the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the labelling view, you can insert labels with unlimited size or insert. note: the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed to use in the EXIF- and IPTC- fields so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and are arranged by special characters. if you want to use the IPTC-sign field in other applications, you should note these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After which you comments, use either the button user or switch to the next image, the labelling are then stored.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the application button there is a button More. with this, you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also read the metadata into the files. but this is always carried out if you have posted a metadata setup, which is always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The evaluation is an assessment scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorsions. either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard abbreviated Ctrl + 0... 5. the evaluation from the sidebar is used to evaluate more photos at the same time, select this from and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC market. encoding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The box view shows a searchbox for filtering the words, the keyword tree and a select box with the previously seen in this & digitization; -session appealed swords.</seg>
<seg id="362">The sample-tree is adapted dynamically with the search phrase. you can limit the number of possibilities in search for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful if you have many words.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the lower end is another relief for inserting in a picture series. if you have entered various keywords, they are saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords may also be set by markers of the appropriate checkbox in the tree. all keywords of a picture are stored in the IPTC field.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword box, this only applies to the highlighted picture and not on the entire selection, If you want a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword keyword.</seg>
<seg id="366">The page of the keyword is used to change the selection in the main window. usually, the left side bar is used with their album, - Datum-, keyword and search interface. if in addition, one or more keyword filters from the right-hand side will be used, only the section quantity of these two are displayed. all of the displayed are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drain. suppose you have selected several pictures in the main view. if the keyword already exists, you can simply pull it out of the right sidebar and put on the selection. then a dialog appears if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displaying the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword filter is selected on no tablet, which has been selected by Ctrl + a, and afterwards there was a keyword from the right keyword on the selection and set up there. a dialogue asks whether this keyword is set to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">These search for changes takes place at each start of the program. it can also be turned off on settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and determine that it should be one or his, you can easily change this with a double-click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry in which the database is searched. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, key term, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string that is already placed in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify an advanced search over all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you just need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. the options then look as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free space station is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I have mostly adapted to & digitization; s specific implementation adapted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you put a colorfully workflow in the colours of your camera or scanners, you can easily reach the colours of your camera or scanners, allowing you to print the colors on your monitor or scanners, or do the colours you print out of your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme comes on color management, everybody wants to know which buttons it needs to be necessary for the results they want. unfortunately, the sense of this tutorials is to provide sufficient background information about color management. additionally, links with deeper information allow you to get your own informal decisions to make you get the desired outcome.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your picture has passed all six criteria listed below, you don't have to take care of color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">They work on a monitor which is calibrated on the sRGB-colour space. (see further information below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your single other editions are by e-mail or web, where sRGB is the de-facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy, why should you then use a different colour space and have to worry about color pigpng?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see the hufisenshaped region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger colour cards, so visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site, and then click Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to add my monitor when I decided to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! if you are working in the RGB-colour space or not, you will need to sign up your monitor. if you are working on sRGB-allibrates, you must either use your monitor on sRGB-standard, then you'll need to use your monitor on the sRGB standard, an appropriate monitor profile, or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, try a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, compensate, automatic and contrast wiping out the menu automatically, automatically check your colors the best. you will have to experiment with these effects, to see which seems best at your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method is scaled above the whole picture so that the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing his color shading. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed away.</seg>
<seg id="391">Compensate: this method adjust the luminosity of the colours of the selected image, so that the histogram of intensity can be used as flat as possible. thus, the same very good results in improving the contrast of a picture, sometimes it produces only garbage. it is a very powerful operation which causes either miracle in a picture or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright border tones, and adjusted the rot-, green and blue channels on the entire histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and the luminance of the RGB values of a picture by postpone the lowest and highest values in the highest possible range and a new jiusement of all values in between. this is only visible in full-sized images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white-off & digitization; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white off of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-equal correction is something limited because of a colour space with 8-bit per color. if you can do so far from the original picture, areas can occur with overexposed conditions, which works in 16-bit mode, so your possibilities for correction can be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white equivalent balm that is protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start the menu entry colors white off the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The storage window can be adjusted in size. on the left-hand side are adapted to the original image as well as the preview of the target. if you want to see the original whip you want, then it's enough to click on the window window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of Pixels below this markers are displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right above is a histogram displayed that dynamically is modified as soon as you have a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels are very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your score depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadow alignment allows you to improve or dimming the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat with the above-mentioned checks should be used, you should use the colour temperature pipette. press on this button and then switch to the image below for calculating the color temperature of the white noise. this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">Additionally, you can set the white off with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposed indistator increases the colors if more than a colour channel of pixels are overexposed.. you will display the combined result in the white balance displayed. this is shown in a preview of pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons Save as and Store are exactly this. each setting of the white block that you have set to save you in a text file and reload it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The default settings will reset all the filter values again to their standard values and the corresponding white-roll. note that also neutral settings will be given another photo as your original. if you save these changes your original picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the Kodierungers per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit coding is better suitable for high quality images. this encoding requires even more disk space, calculating time and is designed for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool will open the same dialogue such as processing of rough images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. colour mapping can be carried out by the window of color profiles. a detailed manual for use of color profiles can go to the Rate.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under colors tone accurate correction. this tool provides a built-in way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously, allowing you to use these for several photos. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner can always use the same mistakes and you will always need the same corrections. in the manual on the tonic correction, you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find below colors Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The digitization; tool colour effects makes you four colour effects, a solar-effect effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter available.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of the chemical processing was Solarisation, also called Sabatier, an effect of the sensitive photopapier of the additional light. this one had the effect that the brighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second lighting. the result was a partial negative of the picture. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the Solarisation. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what chemical is possible. another increase is finally produced, a negative picture that doesn't produce photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar production efficiency. the original picture is the (1) and that processes (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. he differs from a saturation that it makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simply, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for one on daylight optimised colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujib. Velvia offers very saturated colours at daylight and high contrasts. however, the characteristics make him a film of choice for natural photography. Velvias strongly saturated colors are also a few photographs of photographs, especially the most popular landscapes, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light at contrasting. the parameter levels controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeats the strength of the neonlight. in large pictures the filter can relieve the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras frequently have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to change the different color aspect of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a picture of bad lighting conditions, you can obtain a good choice for brightness / saturation. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation requires a good choice to reduce saturation. all changes you can do in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple leukemia / contrast / Gamma, the tool is very complicated to improve exposure of exposure. even if the dialogue on this tool is very complicated, you need to explain the range of applications only the range of sliders. specifically, the three shifts below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, active channel or the selected area. under the graph, three shifts can be clicked into the image and the left side represents the dark and right side of bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to manage operation is to postpone the control knocking, and make sure the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand, the original and the preview of the picture can be viewed. the preview is dynamic, updated with the settings of the image, updated on the left-hand side are the following options available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: if the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y-axis. for images of a digital camera, linear histogram is frequently dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case, logarithmic organization is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the top for dark tones, middle for bright tones and the lowest for middle tones, frequently called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colour pinpettes can be used in the preview of the original picture, to adjust the input values of the shadow, medium and bright tones automatically. in addition, there is a button for an fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to evaluate the output values as well as in the input rate. for example, compression values can be used as a background to create something else in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, image values are automatically set depending on the image values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and store: using these buttons, the set values in the file system can be stored and later loaded, the Gimp levels format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values will automatically be adjusted for all shadows, means and sun sets. activate the colour pipette you want to use and click on the picture of the original picture for Rot-, Green, Blue and Luminans channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option Transitional Indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you can only see the effect on the preview and it's no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as output values are unchanged. the original picture is marked with (1) and the corrected image (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand side, half of the original and the target image is indicated. the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings. on the right side the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modification channel: this select box allows to specify the channel that is modified from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, two symbols are located between a linear and logarithmic view. most of the linear mode is the most useful. for pictures featuring large areas of constant color, the linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case, logarithmic mode also helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a cuventeil to the right, i.e. the bright sound, then you can see that these bright tones can be corresponded with darker lebars and the corresponding image pixel can be darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos, you want to see a red markings. if you want to change this mark on the curve you want to change the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and store: with these buttons you can do exactly this. every curve you created can be downloaded and later loaded in the file system. file format is the Gimp's format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three color pipettes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, midrange and sun beds. enable the colour pipette you want to use and click on the original picture to put the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option overexposed indicator indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you can only see the effect on the preview and it's no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white picture that was corrected within the luminance channel. shadow and Sonnentöne was used with color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digicame; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or modify the colour shaded parts of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel blender of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">You can select the colour for the histogram: this gives you a first reference as you can correct the channels by adding the relative distribution and precipitation. the left area of the window is showing you a preview of the window. the original can be viewed on your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target features a red marker. if you position this picture appears a vertical line in the histogram to display the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are right: controls for red, green and construction permit you to mix this channels. if you want to activate the appropriate colour components, as the channel Mixer is able to generate DAS tools for the creation of great black-white conversions of your photos. try the green channel for black-and-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a colour to a visible smoke comes from the same place in the color channel and what the case is different, you can enhance your Monochrome conversion into which you can reduce the colourless first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The store and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any mixer setting can be saved later and then download. the use file format is the Gimp-channel format format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option Transitional Indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you can only see the effect on the preview and it's no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in the blue channel re-adjusted. the option Luminance is activated. the original picture is under (1) and the processed image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white-photography was always fascinating about your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a step of working because color pictures can easily be converted to the computer. also with a set of film rollers.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks great, with all scenarios and fits especially well to portraits in the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (TM) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange-filtered: simulates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, marine scenes and air photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) orange-filtered.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic kingdom effects and can simulate lunatic effects on the time of day. so similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) Rotary filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulated a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: generates warm bright and medium tones throughout he adds a little cold into the scrap window. this is very similar to the process of unleaded a pressure and redevelopment in a sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using the & digitization; tool texture, you can use decorative textures on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image regardless of whether it's a color image or not, you can look it like an oil painting on a screen, the stitch of an old master, a pop type portrait of enlarged points or such as a mural on a wall. the menu entry can be used for it.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone of this parameter increases the impression of the depth and three dimensional qualities of texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text-effect has been applied on the picture below. the original picture is (1) and changed (2). the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">The & digitization; tool frame will add a decorative frame to be added to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of a viewer in the limits of a photos is not easy task. to retain its attention, it is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. in picture frame, the module can be started from image editing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, place the desired cream type for your image. go through the picture with a thin line and a broad frame (ideal for black-white pictures), bevelled it with a nice three-dimensional setting of the ideal is for a pop-up effect and decoratively adding a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: the width of the frame is in percent. the range for width is 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The finish setting with the frame is larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">Using this practical tool, you can insert simple formatted text into a single image. this also happens in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with your characteristics as you need. the larger the picture, the larger the character set size. to conclusion, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Every setting you chose for your text may be changed until you push the button "OK." after the picture has been saved, the text part of the image is the image of the image. it cannot be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digitization; tool stencil to apply a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Image Image template can be used in image processing can be used to lay templates about a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template, there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation. you must, however, use the PNG file format and should be able to add with maximum compressing (9) to add template file size. if you want to send your template to the digitization; send us an e-mail in english to the & digitization; Mailing list digicame-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you are using this tool to the first time, you'll need to set your template folder with the button base folder. select the folder in which you have copied the template files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for the stencil, a tree view is reflected, which reflects the folder structure of the template's template. the selection of a folder will update the stencils of the stencils automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob virtually enlarges the picture. it is centered around the position of mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button shrinks the picture below. if you want to drop the template on the whole picture, you'll need to reduce the picture accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Postpone: use this button to shift the picture below the template. take the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">OK. use OK if you want to use the template onto your image. the image will then be adapted automatic of the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digicame; sets three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but generates, especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharpness-mask works on the contrast of the edges to look closer to the edges. indeed, it does not work to remove atmospheric Dunst and it makes it a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and he is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refuses is perhaps the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit complicated in its use and has different parameters for adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus and most digitalized images require a correction of the sharpness. this is precisely that the digitisation process needs to be summarized in a common color. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points can be printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more and more bearable sharpening as normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG image, a camera of internal sharpening has been applied frequently. pictures in the shell format must always be sworn in during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a sharpness already while reading the image. if you disable this, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can get useful results by pressing a photo using the sharpening tool. you can correct the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should do this carefully, because the results are not very natural: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but amplifies the noise. in general, the usable technique increases Refokusse. in general, you can easily fix it via the menu entry. under Refokusse you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to fix the image a little soft, is much easier than it to sharpen. use the tool for a softsign with the menu entry and experiment something with settings. the front window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp masked is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original picture and the preview can help edit the picture. the window display shows the output of the felt with current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and amount. the default values are often good results and should be tried out. if you generate the unsharpest mask to be strong, noise and impression of grats are in the proximity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents a how many pixels are affected by the filters. high-resolution images allow bigger radials. they should therefore sharpen images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wipe image that is added to the original. thereby, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a fraction of the maximum RGB-value and to apply differential amount. it can therefore define a minimal differential so for a channel of filters. in this way, areas with a soft change between the tones are exempt from sharpen and therefore flaw errors in faces, heavens and water areas.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the inspirited filter. the original picture is the (1) and the processed image (2). unsharp masked with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digitization; tool Refokusse refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool is trying to use a picture to & quot; refocussing quot; in which it uses a technique called FIR Vienna Filtration. the traditional technique for sharpening images is usually better results than insharp masked. you can start using the menu by refusing colors refuses in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular fuss is much better than the Gauß's Funding. the Gauß 'slide has also depend on the source pixies that are far from the original quellpixel or so far, the FIR Viennese Inverse is influenced by far from the original pixels, which causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular stention. it is the most important parameter for use of this module. for most pictures, the default value should be 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is very unsharp, but then should pay attention to Heiligenpons.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: the correlation can reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpest effect of module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in space filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values increase from 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 only rarely are helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a usable value is 0,03. a high value is still missing the picture.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauss's sharpness. this is most frequently caused by a previously specified fault filter. in most cases, you should not use this value to 0 to increase annoying artifacts. if you need a value unequal zero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / oderloden filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrizenry: this value determines the size of transformation matrix. however, if you choose large values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß's sharpness. note that the module is very slow if you choose large values for these parameters. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any refuses parameters you have set for later and then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all the cutting, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image. the reason for this is that much surgeries changes are not visible immediately, but leave uncomfortable artifacts later.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read pictures and compressed, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masked better results than sharpening. this could be causing intense masked to use a larger neighborhood as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it must always cause artifacts. even under the optimal conditions there is never to remove artifacts. for the Viennese filters you can show that it is the optimal Lineare filter. practical is the result of the FIR Wiener Filters always at least as good as the unsharpness mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better for processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between different filters, on a small, unfocused image, see:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unclear colour image has to be corrected. this picture has been taken with a analog camera. the unfocussed result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of sharpening error correction in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English below this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob is put down the sharpness of the area that was darkened in order to generate a more natural Pupomile.</seg>
<seg id="514">The colour content allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most developed tool to remove non-desired artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The inlaid algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings for a adjust, you can use the riders smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail production p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of details. a small value leads to a smooth glass above the image. a value of 0.9 should receive details so that no sharpening is needed. please note that it should always be subordinated to the details of the description of the direction.</seg>
<seg id="520">Alpha dependency alpha [0,100]: a small value smooths evenly throughout all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film grabs or CCD noise will generate a high value of wave-like patterns. JPEG Artefacts will be best at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this puts the maximum accuracy factor on all. p then define the relative smoothing. therefore please use this value to the degree of space in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is necessary, because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: there is usually 1 or 2 of the algorithm. usually enough is 1 or 2 out of the algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle width da [5, 90]: angle dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is small, should also be chosen as well. be sure to create small angle a long runtime. thus, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stride length [0,1, 10]: integral stride length in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel glances and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">You can use linear interpolation: the more to quality you get through the choice of this option is only slight. but it doubles the duration. we therefore recommend it to allow him.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save as and loading precisely this. any setting of image errors can hereby be saved in a text file and later loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still be very long and a high CPU load after themselves. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below, you can see how image errors will be corrected using small artifacts. as you see, there is a peculiar black artifact in the foreground, that caused by a bad film storage during the journey. the original picture is below (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The digitisation & digitisation was a very powerful tool to reduce shots. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heckel.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts which come from dust or hair on the lens, which can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, so you can read this tutorial in English.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screen picture above shows a typical scene that was made using a digital camera and high sensitivity. it shows a graven noise that can be successfully removed using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you will only need the subwindow details and the subwindow advanced settings can remain at default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) which is used for the filter. large values increase the time that filters per pixel can be used through the image and the colour in it will be smoother and adjusted for smaller bugs.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness of sharpness. if it is increased, smokers are deleted. you might need to readjust the edges -filter. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer receive and noise or lubricate again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge precision for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the felt. if it is too strong it cannot occur to the whole space or hitting smoking. put it to a value close to the maximum, if you want to remove a weak space or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend you either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by details.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the colour tolerance of the image. we recommend you to change either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by details.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase tolerance values of the dark areas, which typically increases stronger, however, the shadow ranges.</seg>
<seg id="541">Absorption: controls the calibration of the phase shift on variations of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother, noise and phasenjitter appear on the edges. he can remove robbing and phasenjitter on the edges. he can remove smoking and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store and store: these buttons are used exactly for it. all parameters for roaring reduction you have set to be stored in the file system and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original picture is marked with (1) and that corrected (2). the noise reduction was applied to the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture can be crisp for your purpose. the solution to fix the image a little soft, is thankfully easier than a painting with the menu entry corrected and experiment with the glitter. the front window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation to your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digitization; Photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to decrease photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoring gives you the possibility of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to emerge in digital, original or retroactive digitalised pictures of digital, original or retroactively digitised images. the smoothing takes place along the image contours and thereby preserves the content as it does the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texture. the algorithm uses a different tool, the image error correction, developed. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / Franconia and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. it produces some compression & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards that are uncompressed in uncompressed image. this setting is to correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons Save as and Store are exactly this. every setting of photo restoration can hereby be stored in a text file and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still be very long and a high CPU load after themselves. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below, you can reduce how a photo with tie-shaped noise can reduce. the module is applied to a black and white picture that with a Minolta (TM) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film-grain on the faces. the original picture is below (1) and that corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below, you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures will be reduced to an old colour photo that has been read with a scanner. the original picture can be seen from the scannerical light and photopapier. the original picture is below (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digitization; tool Hotpixel allows you to remove Hotpixel from photos that have been taken with a CCD camera, eight have been used algorithms from the JPEGPixi Project that copyright protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are a problem, because there are many cameras with JPEG compression via a built-in suppression of hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; bright pixelquot; on a photo with a dark image subtractive method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button dark. the tool will detect automatic and bright pixels. these are highlighted in image detail.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you can record the dark directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First described, as described in the previous section, you should download the right dark picture to the correct image. note here that the assistant will notice the last dark and reloads this automatically at the next meeting.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview can help you correct the result. the sample window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all areas of view.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the felt. select the best filter method for interpolishing this pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duration: it is determined by an average of the neighbor pixel. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels have a distance of 1 from the pixel block to calculate a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixel.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block can be calculated to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn, to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixel.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel Correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, applied. the original picture has been increased to 300% (1) and the correct image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digitization; Vignetanimal correction is a tool to correct the Vignetum, i.e., exposed corners to correct one image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide-angle lens, particularly those in medium and large photo format, often can't illuminate the entire sensor area. instead & quot; vignetanimal quot; (shady) they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture by sending the light to the sensor there.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has disadvantages. many Center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the Blendenim, which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lens should also be possible, even with center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, otherwise pressure effects caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the major exposure areas of today's filtration and color scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of an Centerfilter, it is possible to simulate the effect of an Centerfilter, which is used without this filter. the algorithm is protected by a Centerfilter to a picture. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators, you can control the Vigneto-correction filter, and with three further exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light controls on the point of the widest density of the Filters. the standard density amounts to 2.0, which allows an optical filter to compensate for a larger degree of Vignetum, reduce it to compensate it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leuphstarch, contrast, and gamma attitudes: the edit of a picture with the Vignetworked correction reduces the luminance of pixels. you will need to readjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controllers make you only positive values, as you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a hostile reproof of the purpose of the target, so let the values for lightness / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digitization; image processing from the menu color Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vigneto correction on a picture. the original picture (1) shows the correct picture in the vertices and (2) the correct image. it was also performed in the picture with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The digitization; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lentils on photos. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. colour distortion can not be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second order deals with the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convwitch form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The third-grade coefficient has a similar circuit effect, but laughs at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the fourth quarter corrected the remote corners to the second degree. if you combine these two can be eliminated, virtually all geometric distortion can be eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the distortion second degree. with negative values can be corrected tp-shaped distortion and positive values hovel-shaped distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the fourth order. this value affects more strongly in the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'corners' parameters are the reverse character of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this is scalzing the image size, and thus leads to a correction of the first degree. negative values increase, while positive the picture shrinks.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value adjust brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialogue with a preview of Reducal correction. the values you use for your image will be stored and used for the next start as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tons or hover-shaped correction should be carried out prior to all concision or size changes. in case you lead this correction as all the first. if you want to re-cut a picture and then make a ton-shaped correction it would be the effect of the wrong one.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool gives you a vertical and horizontal relief line. move it to an important place, such as the sea front or a building screen, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this place. in the connection, you can correct the rolls / hover-shaped distortion with the help of lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">When you fix an cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can use this with the cutting tool in the menu. you can remove them from the image processing or via the zoom control of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures, the riot-shaped correction is sufficient. the next logical step for some motifs such as recordings from front, frame and paintings is the perspective so to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees. note that when you keep the camera with the hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tons-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original picture is below (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the Gimpguru.org website which is reachable in this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (TM) SFX200 Iinfra film, see this URL. this movie has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left-hand side of the window you can select the range for preview. if you postpone the red rectangle with the mouse, you can regard the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can simulate two parameters of filming and filensitivity (ISO). activating the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO controls changes the amount of filming and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in converting. green meadows will know how snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filters are mixing on the reproduce of infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos, as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared profile standard used on a landscape photo of New Zealand. the original picture is under (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the trotter.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digitization; filter movie grabs is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce filming on your pictures, such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, known to increase the sensitivity of the movies to mix the producers of great silver grades.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film designer effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere release from everyday life. if you want to use this special, Gallery-like, street photographic, grained sight especially in your monochrome photos, so you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the granularity. the default value is, though often longer values are needed, to ISO-2400 if you still need more grains, so you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the filming effects on a black / white picture. the original picture is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity is ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digitization; filter oil painting generates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digitization; filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice appearance as an oil painting. natural images and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to affect this effect. the top chooses the brush size between one and five. thick brush are better suited for big images. smoothing the glitter or, from the other side view, the charness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is marked with the (1) and that worked with the (2). pin-size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and Glitter 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digitization; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gradient to produce a carboneskizze. it is therefore not ideal for this effect. it's helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch you. this would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator chooses the pin size and the bottom adjusted the contrast (straight).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon filter filter. the original picture (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be improved further by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digicame; filter engraving shape your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digicame; filter engraving is a quick tool to give your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works especially well in pictures with a simple structure where color does not use the most important in the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the picture into a gray, monumental landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to set the contrast of the filtering process. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by crushing effects. it uses the copyright algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divides the image in cells and looks like it is considered by glass-blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the wavelength 1, the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time for calculating and create a high CPU load. you can break these effects any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo in an art work with unsharpness effects. it uses the copyright algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpness: wipes the image along a creepy lines that go out from a focus. this simulates a zoomous camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radicals: wipes the image by turning the pixels around a centre. this simulates the sharpness of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance sharpness: omens the image to create a non-focus camera se. the object seems to be reversed in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement-sharpness: wipes the picture by horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the sharpness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographing, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Atmospheric nonsense: wipes the picture soft in dark and strong in bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and glossy focus effect (Hamilton Effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or add a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sagittarius: wipes the image by random shifting of pixels and simulates the sharpness of a arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent tempo: finds the paint in the image and get it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it through the colt with an average Pixels value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. so you can end this calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The shelves are a nice small tool to make regentropes on your image. thereby it gives natural your images a wet look. it uses a protected fashion algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Drop size does not allow the size of drips. because the size of the image is not automatically growing with the size of the picture it is often necessary to decrease the size of small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes changes the optical effect of drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can keep using the & digitization; image processing a range free of shelves. use the Select tool to keep the area, e.g. a face that will remain free to stay. if you then start the filters, the area will remain free of rain drops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the shelf life. the original picture (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture (2) indicates a sunset over a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through spies or turning into the right direction. the tools can be found in the menu transformers, rotating or transformers.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo bubbles is definitely one of the most advanced tools in order to enlarge a photo in a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture of shrink is simple. the big question is, how can you find a picture and keep the details sharply? how can you find the missing information or guess? the CImg algorithm used here is a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo is the wrong size you can change it to the desired size with the tool size. choose transformation size change in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is visible below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size is changing a linear interpolation method to increase the pixels. if you want a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to blow up.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many educational programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digitization; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to say the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original size may be retained for the input of the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is necessary, because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">Buttons Save as and loading will be used exactly. each entry for photo can be saved as text file and later loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo bubbles is very quick at what it does, but it can still last long and a high CPU load after themselves. you can interrupt the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below a sample of the picture below by adding a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged view (2) is the result of the linear standard augmentation.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not only a frequent operation, but also a often underestimated tool to create a picture. in order to cut a picture, you just need to cut the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and drag the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle while moving the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you get rid of the mouse button, the area of the photos will be cut off. by this way you will get a good overview of how your photo would look after the cut. you can create the size of the right-cutting area by pushing onto the corners of the rectangle. just create a new rectangle using the left-hand mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting-section, use the button The cut-button in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the entries to save or file save in the menu file to save the newly added photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In front area, you can change the size of the rectangle by setting the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio, which you have defined in the dialogue, will be retained.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After offset ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or cross-format. in the high-format, the larger value of height and width is assigned to width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool according to aspect ratio uses a 10 aspect ratio. that means it is always equal, regardless of whether you can see centimeters, inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons around the selection automatic or vertically centered.</seg>
<seg id="647">In the dialog, you can use the Max. ratio button to cut the range for cutting on the maximum possible, depending on the chosen relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool according to aspect ratio saves his settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you are able to view the power tool, these settings will be stored as default values in the EXIF tables, so the EXIF data are redesigned to display the cut picture and not the original picture.</seg>

<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third elrule, harmonic triangles are one way to divide a rectangle in a similar harmonious triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a split by different natural growth patterns, such as spiral of a Nautilus shell or the petals of a sunflower. it appears in all kinds of things we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden partition is the Irrational number 1,618033988... and it was already used for the old Egyptians and Greeks who designed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1,618 the golden middle. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden midrange provides liquid auxiliary lines for you to put together a picture. these help are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden spiral will bring good results for your photos. compared to third elrule, the golden spiral produces a liquid line which can follow the eye on the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow along this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. there should be something that the eye is in the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects. this can be simply because without the eye, it will fulfill his task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangle also derives from the above-mentioned golden spiral. its commissions are the middle points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are no equivalent triangles. diagonals to this lines can place a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you are using golden triangles inside your framework, you will create an effect of the professional photographer dynamic symmetry. try your image focus on one of the intersection and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition you can't achieve.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and vertical can be used to mirror harmonious particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color, you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the assistance lines can be invisible. in this way, you can adjust the color of lines your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free press is a tool to rotate a picture of any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you do a photo, it's easy to keep the camera straight vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture where things are rotated by an angle. you can use this with the & digitization; image processing and the tool-free press. select transformation, free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the default values are set in degrees. with the button Preferences you can set the slider back to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image will be shown right above.</seg>
<seg id="664">To help your help, the Free press is available a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointing to the two lines. once you can fix it over an important point of the picture, you can adjust it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have shot a picture, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a possibility to repair it is to use the function transformers from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is the function Automatically cutting. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option Anti-Aliasing smoothes the image a bit after the shooting. but note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All persistent transformations are carried out by a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares in the corners of your image. the preview will then be calculated automatically. on the right-hand side of the dialog, you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas that are created through transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including empty areas that are created through transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Corner at the top: shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="673">Corner right above: shows the current angle in degrees on the upper right corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="674">At the bottom of the bottom: shows the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="675">Corner right below: shows the current angle in degrees on the lower right corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image becomes a bit dirty. for a single adaptation this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After choosing the perspective, you get unjoyable triangular holes at the corners. one possibility to transfer this to the picture with transformers cut from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool is used to move a portion of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. this is no rotating, the picture is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module about transformation shots.</seg>
<seg id="679">Use your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you push preferences and vertically at the same time. if you push preferences, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right of the preview area.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and horizontal line is displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the switch tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After completing the damage, the image becomes a bit sleepy. for a single coating this effect is usually negligible, but two chings are caught up twice as much failure and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After etching, the painting has indrical triangular holes in the corners. one possibility to eliminate it, it is the image with transformers cutting out of the image processing.</seg>

Graphs are used in science, especially in computer science, and so far there was no modern & GUI; -program to split by graphs; - or & tcltk; programs with only few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & co-viewer; project set itself to replace these programs through a modern and user-friendly graphic interface with all functions of a well integrated & KDE; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& graphic viewer; is a KDE program for viewing of & graphviz; -graphs. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & graphic viewer; displays Graphene with all possibilities of a well integrated & KDE; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI. it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & Kate; and & Konqueror; (making a change in the graphs in & Kate; the graph is calculated and in & graphic viewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graphs in & Kate; open or drag the graphs in & graphic viewer; open in & Kate; component.</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading of large graphs (currently there are problems starting from about 1000 nodes and a hack to represent more than this node)</seg>
<seg id="731">Other required software: & graphic viewer; is a & KDE; -program that requires the & graphviz; -tool & dot; for presentation of the graphs. required are:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window shows the opened graphs, every one in their own subwindow. at first, if you open & kratviewer; without any argument, the tool bar contains only the symbol file and the (empty) list of final files. click on the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After choosing one or more & dot; -files selected, the main window looks like in the bottom screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview in the corner is shown if the Graph is bigger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special buttons, left and right at pressive & old; -key);</seg>
<seg id="736">The zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below, you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the file has just changed in & grapher; invited file has been modified by another program, the following window is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose if the Graph is to be reloaded, or whether you want to ignore the change, so that later it will change. if you want to change your decision later, you can set the menu option atgraphic viewer; set up, see also.</seg>

<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but change it with the dialog dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">During the program start, you can reopen all the Graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice both as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also define how the graph is to be divided into multiple pages. the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely elected.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you are using multiple pages, you can choose if the parts of the graph will be fit on this page. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph.</seg>

<seg id="750">& dot; algorithm, the standard for grated graphs. it produces hierarchical or historical representations of targeted graphs. the algorithm sets the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and tries to produce as short corners and as short edge-overlaps.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for undefined graphs. it is produced representations according to the springboard model. the camada-Kawai algorithm uses the same with statistical multi-dimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates a springed model of the spring model. it uses the Fruit-Reingold-Heurism, and includes a multilayer trigger for the treatment of large and groued graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & circo; algorithm arranges the nodes circular at the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for specific diagrams of several times cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Open a dialog where you can specify a layout command, which is then executed by a shell. the order should give graphs to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command you can specify & eg; the & graphviz; -algorithms special options, or modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>

<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localisation provides tools available to locate images geographically in the spherical coordinate system, which is used by GPS and Galileo. height, longitude and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data, you need a GPS track as an XML file in GPX format. gpsbabel and gpsyou can download and convert data to you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographic Localization Korrelator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and retrieve the menu. in order to load a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to load a spin file with GPX file. this file contains of course dates back to the same locations as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded into an automatic corcorrelation, the coordinates are displayed in red. GPS spurdata is recorded in GMT time, and therefore the camera-time must be converted with the GMT. this can be done with the time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The deviation for the maximum time deviation gives a top deviation for the GPS-time and camera measures. the deviation is covered, among them, the maximum value is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you don't have a spin data from one place for pictures you can edit the GPX file manually and add to the pictures. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and difference in minutes can be used if you don't have appropriate data. if you know that in reality a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these boundaries here and then correlate to the button.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be manually set with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same place. as the dialog can use the button OK, you only need to use the button OK to set the data on the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set up with the displayed card and get sie.Add this always through, until you have achieved a reaching accuracy. the level must always be selected manually. the card can be changed manually between card mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>

<seg id="821">The KIPI module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums than HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set will encodes UTF-8 to provide a best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders on which the settings can be adapted. the riders are allowed to select all albums that are exported to HTML. with the three buttons on the right side you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area, the alarm will appear and the text of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider's appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this rider is a link for each image. if you click on a picture, a new page will be displayed in the image. otherwise, the image will appear directly with your standard screen, & eg; Kuickshow, displayed.</seg>
<seg id="825">The rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery can be saved with all your respective images. select a folder from which you write permission. a subfolder with the name KIPIHTMLExport, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, EXIF information of your original images are also stored in the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="827">Using other color depth, you can change the default color depth. naturally, it affects the file size. all other settings are self-explaining.</seg>
<seg id="828">The rider curtains allows you to watch some of the settings from the album Reiter for the thumbnails, these are small pictures that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A Progress window displays the user at how far the action is. press dismantling to break the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">When the module has created the pages, the window is not automatically closed. you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors occur during the generation. the web browser will automatically start to display the preview of the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI picture viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as scripts, zooming or shift. the viewer can be used with short-term display and quick access to his functions.</seg>

<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Loss-free module is a tool to change pictures without changing your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows to save images in JPEG format, without the usual losses of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of lossless storage, it is the file size increases because there is no compression of color information. this is, for example, the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool that you can connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client has not currently have documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI teams under KDE-based @ kde.or.Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata Editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the mailing list KDE-based @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata mode, you can copy data from one image to another. select the picture file extensions with which you want to copy the picture file, so the image to which you want to copy the metadata. copy the data after which you have pressed the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function wasn't working with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not in any target format. JPEG is supported while writing. please look at Exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodierer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length, to convert. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add a base mapping in the MP2 or WAV of the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images will be scaled automatically to the correct size for the chosen video format. additionally, you can create a background color for your DVD player. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. you can only use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">First you have to packed the images which are to be packed into MPEG gashau. after that, you can start using the Module MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected from you are then named among image files in the portfolio. there you can also change sorting images or the content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should select the other settings. if you are planning to select the file format, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning the file on a TV, you need to select the corresponding TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is pre-set and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should indicate the time in seconds. the speed of the image will be specified, and a low value creates very sudden, a high, very smooth switch changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set up next. in doubt, you should get it black. in doubt, you can define the name and path of the generated file, you can specify the extension of the MPEG-output file.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify a audio file under the name of the audio file, this will be integrated into the film. after all the settings are adapted to your wishes, you can enjoy the creation of the film. depending on the speed of your computer, you can make sure to drink a coffee and enjoy the gashau if you are back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a hint appears that Kodierer or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the button settings to the right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printing assistant allows you to print several pictures on a sheet of paper. the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g: sense to improve or print with the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import and convert your images stored in the RAW format in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line utility dcraw by Dave Coffin. a original quote from Him is: expect from dcraw not to produce the same results as the software from your camera makers. sometimes you get better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file, then select the module and start the module. the Raw-image converter window appears then in mode for a single image. with the knob you can view the effect of your current settings to the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now readjust the values to optimize the Converting process. the first option decides whether the camera's settings will be used for the white balance. if the result is not optimal, you can process the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected, so you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can select one of the three output formats and the conversion result will be immediately and only the extension is adapted accordingly. JPEG uses a low-loss algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged image format, TIFF reserves all the information of your image and uses lossless LZW compressing.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you prefer to edit your pictures frequently or later you should not use the JPEG format, as it is only a limited number of operations before it is allowed to deteriorate the image quality. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata is stored in the RAW file in the JPEG file in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start converting the button. if you want to cancel the process again, you can use this process.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stacking processing mode allows you to convert various images to once. use this mode, so if you are sure, e.g., by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images. however, you have the opportunity to automatically rewrite the file automatically. this is helpful if these have been generated in an earlier attempt. however, a preview can not show how far the conversion is progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program of the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, starting point and the timestamp of the image.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection. it uses the Book program from ImageMagick package. you can reduce the picture, or enlarge. to this, four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. width or height of the image is automatically selected, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. this option remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your image to screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">No proportional: non-proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed at this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Prepress: prepares the image for the photo pressure. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, Randsize and background colour, is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module, you can send selected images with your preferred email program. it is also possible to change the size of the added pictures before. more images can go to the list of some images and lay there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you start the module, the pictures window with the photos selected from you are displayed. over the button pictures you can add more photos. for the last selected image, you will see a preview on the right-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the picture list and insert the list of images added to the list.</seg>
<seg id="875">The button photos will remove the selected images from the list of the taken pictures.</seg>
<seg id="876">Once you have selected all pictures you can open the new message-window of your e-mail clients. you just need to add the addresses and the subject. you have to add selected images as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Don't pay attention to many photos at once. most email accounts have limitations for the size of sending emails. it might be a good idea to send multiple emails if you want to send many photos.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is stored and used every time until you change them.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must indicate in the input field below the right path for your installation.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must install the mailing agent on your computer before. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in an attached file, the comments will be added to the images into a text file and put the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photofiles, but it is best adjusted under lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore have PNG while you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG using file format and file the original files in JPEG format, then the original Exifdata will be added to the original images.</seg>
<seg id="884">If the process is finished, the window will not be automatically closed that you can view your status messages, looking for errors, but your e-mail program will be started automatically by the end. with the button Close you can schlie this window.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module advanced Diaschau, there is a window with questions such as you want your slide show. you can choose between you selected and select any pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL-transitions in the presentation will be enabled very elegant image passes using OpenGL. however, you need to have a corresponding graphics card, otherwise the gashau will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The filenames option ensures that the filename of images will be displayed in the left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop loop ensures that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop. you can manually disrupt it manually with Esc;</seg>
<seg id="889">The option pictures accidentally select that the images are displayed in a random order. so, the pictures are not used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Under delay between the pictures, the temporary distance between the individual images can be set. 1500 milliseconds are 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. you should be the lightest before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose. random choose one another effect between the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="892">While the slide show you can access a tool bar at the top left side. move the mouse in this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this tool bar you can stop and restart the presentation, jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slide.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left bottom of the screen you can see the current filenames, the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date adjusted is still no documentation. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI teams under KDE-based @ kde.or.Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the working area.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of submenus, as background for your KDE-working area.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes, you can see & pair photo album; see picture. as you can see by a comparison with the picture, you are now in any group, i.e. in people, places and in the group keyword entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you see the categories you have entered your pictures and videos with notes. in addition, there are entries to view the folder structure on your hard drive and, of course, look at the current role models.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you push the mouse to the entry, the view of the browser is changing. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only images are displayed on which both persons are visible. by this selection method you can limit the number of displayed images from a few thousand images to a few more photos.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have chosen all those persons, locations, and other settings, you can view image pictures to watch the images of your account.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, every person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can store with & kphotoalbum; however, for any person a personal image of image, this also applies to places, keywords, and other categories that you have defined. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To show images next to the names, select the button, which you need to set right outside on the tool bar. in the context menu, you can select which you can view the view for each category. it has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of people and at the same time a list of sample words (if you don't have suitable pictures for your keyword).</seg>
<seg id="905">You must, however, define what image for each individual person is to be displayed. in order to view this, you'll need to display the picture text editor, as shown in the image. here you can select the image for the corresponding person. in the Ansilicate window, you can select the image factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image will be shown and cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you want to search in the main window, you'll see a dialog displayed by the dialog for determining the image features very much. this dialogue can be seen once more.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you want to enter a string in the box or description, you can also enter a date and descriptions of the images according to this text. if you want, you can also enter a date after that, for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as from 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom part of the window you can search all images according to certain names, as you can see in the picture. here, images are shown on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the manual for & kphotoalbum; if you don't like to read manuals, but rather want to try the following functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and check out the quick-entry, screen photos and introduction videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & photo album; and in the first dialogue the demo, if you start & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu entry into a photo album; -demo. after that, some sample pictures are loaded and you can try the features of & kphotoalbum; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, please find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as an associated HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the lower edge of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar you can see here:. as the name suggests, this body shows you data statistics about images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The schedules can show you several different periods. every bar shows another unit. you can switch between the units, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a portion of a database by showing the bodies only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The schedules can be used on the following ways: you can change the displayed entries in the database (if you select a date, you will always display the first picture of this date in preview window) and also shows the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in preview View.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of the time bar by press the mouse button, and select the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, so the timestamps will draw. if you select a range, you will preview only pictures of this period. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the time bar.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you two ways to create HTML pages with your pictures. one is integrated in & cphotoalbum; integrated and the other as module available (see) in the following part of the user manual, integrated version that you can create over the menu file HTML....</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages have to be created, you need to take some settings. these are divided into three areas of content, layout and target. in the following, each section will be described exactly.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the superblicks and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on a photo album; HTML example sites, you see an example for these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & pair photo album; -Export file will be created, which is to be seen on the oversight. navie information about the export files you'll find in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Lastly, you can select which information is shown on the HTML pages. for example, you can avoid that information displayed by a party. note that & quot album; currently all images are exported. you can't use this setting to hide certain pictures from a specific viewer.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area, you can define how the HTML pages are supposed to look like. most importation possibilities are clear, why this is not particularly received.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can adjust various resolutions for the pictures. this allows those who have to look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no pictures download which have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer's viewer can change the resolution at any time you have set. so he can browse your pictures with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time, browse. if he wants to display a picture larger, he changes to higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setup area, you place the different stewards and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best choose for all your HTML files a base folder and for each subsequent phrase, a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main file in which all your images are stored. this folder will be stored and next time automatically adds. this folder you can select either a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your pictures, you can check whether this really is all for viewer. if you have created a web browser, after the pages has been created, the URL that you define it should be this folder. otherwise the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">In the case that the HTML files are not yet found in the final destination file. so the import function, see, properly, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of current files, but the basic file in which all subfolder are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The straight setup possibilities were drawn, all three based on basic folders and URLs. in these, a subfolder, whose name you can designate in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">In case you are looking for a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; you may have to add a HTML page to view the images. however, if you want to add a HTML page to view the images, reception on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you have to do with & kphotoalbum; this work is not even done.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. you can import files into your database with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in it if the images itself is stored in the file, or if it's only a link to images that you may have all the pictures into the file, so that you can share all the images so independent and that file is so independent. however, the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can export a .kim file directly from the menu file... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this is an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file is looking for images that are in a double way. first, the images are not found in the file the .kim file. if you are looking for creating the HTML files, you are only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for Export images is described above, you can expose through the "Export File" menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialogue is whether it is to act internal or external .kim files. there are three selection options available to you:</seg>
<seg id="938">If you can copy Manually to the .kin file, you will have to copy the pictures into the same folder as the .kin file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatically copy the .kin file copy & photo album; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most pictures are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files. if you want this, simply select the export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you would not want to limit the pictures in full size, as the .kim file is otherwise very large. here you can limit the size by, for example, that each image should be 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you import a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file import... select & kphotoalbum; the exported database as mentioned in detail.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to import made of four steps. first you need to select which pictures you want to import, afterwards, in which folder permission are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you are personalised the category of people who are to use a file name (if you are a Dane), while this category is required for your database. so, in the third dialogue window, you'll be imported into the third dialog box, which correspond to the categories of imported file, and which categories these categories correspond in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can calculate the categories of imported file using the categories of your current database. an example for this you can see on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It needs to be simple, pictures to browse and watch: if you see pictures, you often want to view images within different picture sets & mdash; if you want to discover images from your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures shown on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will take the various steps from (1) fixed information about your pictures, via (2) and see the view and look at (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program for managing your pictures. it has been expanded and today, it is also taking care of your videos. at many places in this manual it is talked about pictures, but frequently this also includes videos.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the top file of their images. it is a simple XML file, which you can use with a program of your choice, such as normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in the CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; remember the folder in which your pictures are stored and used this at future starts. if you want to read another database with pictures, you can start & photo album; with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Using the menu entry atphoto album; set up... enter a window with which you can change the settings of & pair photo album; in the following section of the user guide you will be explained to you the various setup possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can call setup possibilities and options for viewing. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can retrieve a button on the F1 key and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described in you how you can designate various properties for each image, such as persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups like items, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialogue that is used to already exist already existing groups. for each existing group you can choose a lettering and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the dialogue options, you can set up complete members groups, e.g. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a midday as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">You can select the setup possibilities that you are available for fixed the member groups. with the top selection list you can select the category you want. in the left side box you can configure a list with the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; share its modular system with other graphics applications, such as the digikam and Gwenview. this module is called KIPI and means & KDE; Image Plugin Interface. please refer to the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed through the Module modules and will not be described in this manual as they are not part of & pair photo album; however, they are not part of & pair photo album; however, most modules have a help site that you can call via the modules themselves.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used together with multiple applications, it can be that the modules with & kphotoalbums can be tested initially with the demo database before using the command &gt; kphotoalbum -demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or over the menu. do not say, I would not have been warned!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use modules over KIPI are very different, so it can be different that some modules with & kphotoalbum; do not work. this is the disadvantage, when you share functions with various applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other applications are not supported in albums. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order is not supported, it simulates some modules the order to albums so that you can use the features with & kphotoalbum;</seg>
<seg id="962">It simulates & photoalbums; the current album, which is simply the current opinion, so all images that show you the picture show at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Besides the current album, & kphotoalbum has to be handed over; the modules also pass a list of albums. here goes on a photo album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser shows the content of a category, e.g. all people, then each entry of this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category that you have set up in the installation dialog as a category for virtual albums, so for example, if you have selected the category people, & be a photo album; so if you have selected persons to view, and the module will continue.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. in addition, select the setup dialog and select modules, which are supposed to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example for a start screen, once you start & photo album; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you can see the window display at the top of the toolbar. at the moment you don't find any information about your pictures. in the section we will show you on this window, but now you'll see an overview of all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to see any image with notes. this includes information about the persons appearing on the image, where the picture has been taken separately or for a larger number of images certain notes at the same time. if, for example, it is depicted on all images of Jesper and all pictures taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All of these comments can be used for searching and browses, as you can read in the section, if you want to see these notes if you are using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In see three lists with a text box by selecting persons, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & pair photo album; since you will always be able to use information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea lies the shift of images within the list: if you are depicted a family party and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons, you can find out that the names are shifted upward, the people can find faster and arrange.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to receive a alphabetically sorted list, click the icon for sorting according to date below.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you select notes for each image individually, you might need to edit all selected images and have these pictures with notes. simply click on the front and back buttons that can be found under the preview of the picture right above.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more comfortable to mark all these pictures and use the menu option on once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. furthermore, San Francisco and Los Angeles lies in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as an overgroup. to indicate that it is a supergroup, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the menu, it is possible to add an existing or new Excel or subcategory. additionally, you can also put an entry into a category and place there to sort this entry into a subcategory. attention, this assumes you to sort exactly your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can postpone the individual elements of it, by creating the bodies that form the upper edge of the frame, click and move. you can also make your own window as part of the window that you pull it out of the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you adapted the look of the window to your needs so you are satisfied with the settings, click on the button options... which allows you to store the current setup and the appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also get a frame as well. if you want to display it again later, use the button options... and then click on the window. see this process in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the images showing images in the browser, you will receive an overview of preview pictures of the currently selected images, or all pictures if you do not have a filter. for example, you can see the size of thumbnails with the middle mouse button, configure. try it simply.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you make a picture on the background of your desktop, this image will be set as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">When you click on a picture, it will appear in the picture frame. if you don't have a window with an image viewing, a new display window is created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the picture preview. simply select the corresponding pictures you want, or select either the remove button or select in the menu Edit menu. now you'll see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; provides you a solution for this problem. you can also use the pictures stored on the hard disk. of course you need to record the pictures stored in the database Index. in the picture you'll see the view of & pair photo album; if not all necessary pictures of the disk can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures in which the right corner is cut, are not stored on the hard disk. however, for the pictures 5-9, however, the curtains are present, so & quot; you can see the preview of these pictures. however, you can't view these pictures with the image viewing.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see this function, you need to copy files from folders and copy it again. if so, you don't support you to avoid the insertion of your images. if so, please do not support a major hard drive to save all images.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you'll find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to stay a little more privacy, filtering the pictures you would like to be able to open for others and click on the view menu. alternatively, you can also see all images that can see your little sister, please contacting and choose the menu entry Anything as you can.</seg>
<seg id="990">In this case you have set what images should be hidden in the case of your little sister. if you unlock the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry pictures, which you are locked up. if you want to display the images, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to determine a password which needs to be entered into unlocking the pictures. to install this password, just select password change in the menu privacy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please consider that this picture protection is by no means very safe. for one, all pictures on the hard drive and to the others can read or delete the password in the file index.xml. this type of password protection is only for those who are familiar with & photoalbums; not very familiar, view to private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you want to describe your images with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours so you can describe it at some point. for this reason & quot album; with a picture _ and video viewing. you can start from the preview, as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer you can see in the picture. it shows of course the picture, but additional all information you can enter over the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If you want to see the information box on the top part of the picture you want to see and move it differently. you can also configure which information appear and if any information is displayed. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer. you can see the context menu below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the InfoBox are underlined. if you click on Anne Helene here. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you have chosen people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have uploaded multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them and go back by using the keys picture high and picture. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and end. these features are also available from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several pictures are loaded in the viewer, you can run these as Diaschau. & kphotoalbum; invites you to press a new picture after a few seconds. how often it can press a new picture by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus, and stopped and stopped by the keys Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the viewer of & pair photo album; it is used in full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete place on the screen. simply use the input button to switch back in full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you can use the viewer in the picture you can simply pull out in the picture and zoom out in the mouse. with the Minus button, you can zoom out in the center of the picture. shows as a zoom limit is highlighted and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the dot button, you can reset your zoom, so that the picture is not zoomed. with the uniforms the zooms set the zooms so that each pixel is equivalent to a pixel aspect pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomoperations that work with videos that you are in and out zoom out with the Plus- and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the functions from the context menu, you can rotate the image. this doesn't work with videos. you can make comments about the current picture with the menu point notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures you can see a picture with a person whose name you forgot to set out on the picture. at the moment you can watch the viewing and configuration dialog of the picture to mark these names. however, you will probably prefer to mark the picture and look for more images.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to view the pictures on paper. to see which photos you want, you can start the viewer with the pictures and see them as good or bad, while you look one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to paint pictures with features while you can view them. features include the letters A to Z and you can put a feature because you push the corresponding letter. in see a picture where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have placed features on your pictures, you will be able to edit, print or whatever you have selected, so you just have all on one with notes. this is described in detail. afterwards, you can use a module to copy the selected images onto a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview of view. if you can view the categories in DRE preview, then you can simply push the characters for the feature after the image was selected. you can see it here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case allows you to paint your photo album; painting on the picture.</seg>

<seg id="1011">In order to see a picture shown on the screen. to switch the painting by & kphotoalbum; select on the image from the context menu. to finish the painting, just press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you have to use the application of the program & Povray; not fully controllable, but the documentation to & Povray; should you have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select single objects. then, their features are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire-modell- views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time, but not the object of an item already selected, as all subobjects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object, or select one menu entry in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are possible positions, the following foldable menu is displayed, so that you can choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With delete either from the menu bar, or from the context menu of the right mouse button, you can remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to take these changes. if you have invalid values, a message with an error message appears. then you can correct the input error and discard the changes with abruptions.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; use user documentation in setting dialog, you can access the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the Indies View.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press on a preview in the Economic View and a small example of the scene is rendered with the selected texture, even if you want a subordinated element, even if you want a subordinated item (for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), cross it locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screen picture shows the control points of the camera. you can pull these control points with the mouse button and thus change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">If a transformation is chosen, the control points and there will be a small cross in the wireless model view. this cross marks the centre for scaling and turning as well as the position of shifts. you can change the shift through pulling with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a visual stage. you can specify this value relatively to the visible level of the higher level or as absolute value. objects are only displayed if they are selected or their visibility level smaller or equal to the chosen visual stage level of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object features are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement or if you need any other arrangement, you can set them any way. you can also store several window orders and easily switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window over or below a view, drag the connection to the upper or lower edge of a view. a rectangle then shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the connection to the right or left side of a view. the new view will then be anchored on the right or left side of this view, and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you would like to arrange several views over each other, move the check in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views through clicking on the map counter top in the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from the anchor, drag the touch to the screen or click on the small arrow pointing to the left above-line arrow.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To view a view, click on the small cross in the bottom bar. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between arrow and cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views in the main window. in the menu view you will find entries for any kind of views. new views are narrow, you can anchor them at any point.</seg>

<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can rendering them. & kpovmodeler; 3.1g for rendering, this program has to be installed correctly. as this manual is written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To rendering the current scene, click on the icon Rendering The symbol Renders in the tool bar or select the menu entry scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines image size and quality of rendering. if you want to rendering a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you may include any number of Render modes, from a quick preview of up to Full images in the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the icon The Render's icon or click the Render Modi's menu, the following dialog is open:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Every Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it makes a name to recognize the characteristics of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the card size you can enter the width and height of the straight image. if you want to run only a small section of the image, select the section section and give the image section to rendering in input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination with quality, you can select the properties that use & Povray; for rendering. this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflections lighting. a detailed description of the Render properties can be found in the User manual for & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is framed with only a beam of pixels, various errors can occur. these pictures often have a moirè pattern or stuffed effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not shown if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to decrease the influence of these errors. generally, images do better look at this property.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you switch anti-aliasing, calculates and combines & povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is called super sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling the neighboring pixels with included. the second method is adaptive and adaptive because each pixel is always relieved and adaptive because of the calculated depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray will pass a beam of pixels. if the difference between the colour values on the adjacent Pixels, both pixels will be calculated using a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you calculate the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated using an extra value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays each pixel. if the difference is divided between color values the above-level threshold, then the pixel will be checked in 4 sub-pixel, which can be followed individually and set up on further subdivision. the maximum depth of recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of robbery for the beam process, called Jittering. if you switch Jittering, the Rays changed to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last attitude for the quality of the Renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; which calculates diffuse light reflections. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this card card, you can adjust whether the alpha-channels are calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent, if the corresponding rays have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for viewing the & Povray; console issue. if & Povray; unexpectedly, you can find the reason here.</seg>

<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object-tree to the Editor to import the source code for & Povray; this adds the source code for the text file in the Editor. to import objects into the scene, simply mark the source code in the editor and drag it into the object-tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">Copying and insert into & kpovmodeler; and in your Editor you can also insert the source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>

<seg id="1065">You can adjust the object's catching menu in the context menu of the wireless model views. you can adjust the switch separately for shifts, scaling, and rotating connections.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values show an exact wire model and thus a better look for the displayed objects, but require more time to rendering. for some objects such as the ball you can set the detailed level for two directions separately.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you cross high detail projections for advanced projections, all wire versions are used further, if the camera is an extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall is placed behind the objects. the wall is shown in a board pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the ground, a ground below the objects is rendered. the ground is shown in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you check out cantalaids, the non-recursive antialiasing method for rendering the scenes is used. values for depth and swelling can be adjusted. you can find more precise information regarding parameters you will find in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page, you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the section window orders, you can create and save window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The combination field standard window arrangement: shows all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; used the chosen window arrangement at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of window orders displays all existing window orders. a new arrangement can be added to the button and remove a selected arrangement with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and should not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name shows all views of the chosen window arrangement. new views can be added with the button and remove selected views using the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column, you will create a new column on the right side of the existing windows, with bottom card you get a box office view together with the previous view and webbing the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you've just installed & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you would like to follow in this guide, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners: a ball at a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should keep the following warnings carefully before you complain about that you get as a result just a black screen. if you use a 3D program, you should note these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't have a camera, no rules can be applied for rendering as a result, you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't add light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you'll get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have everything flawlessly installed, see the first preset window order at the first start of & kpovmodeler:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar. read the documentation so you can get an appropriate idea what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will have to use these menus and symbols now often, so you should memorize the menus and symbols, and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, first you need to remove all objects from the object tree. mark the scene and then select the menu entry Edit. so you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire-model view shows how the camera sees all the scene you create. in particular, you notice the scene in the fourth wireless model (right below). this is the view of the scene from the camera's view. this shows you the outcome of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on, you can find the content of the view button, where the different parameters of the camera is found. in the user documentation to & Povray; please find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You do not change anything about the camera's basic settings, but note that the camera is able to change the camera in the control points, with which you can change the camera's target point. just click on the left-hand mouse button and drag it to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you push the button application or the ONGABETASTE, the wire-model views and the object-tree instantly changes these settings. as a result, they look here the scene from the camera's view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you might need to insert an end (insert final body jader) and size on x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a controversial method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a simpler possibility. you can use an infinite plane than ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: choose the plain in the object-tree, change the name and then press the button application or the ONGABETASTE. in the object-tree the new name is displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire-model lookout now shows the level now, even at the moment only as limited endental level. if you rendering the scene, the level extends up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you can check the object tree exactly, you'll notice that you can click on the icon + before the object. in this case, you will find only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and displacement. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the ground to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, just so you can get some of these parameters. select shifting and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First choose the floor to set its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose a certain solaches at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialogue in which you can select, as the object should be inserted. the pigment will then change the name in the object tree (name = ground pigment), with a click on the button you see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of Pigments only shows a Mattes black material because you have settings for the pigment. do you always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview. also, there are many possibilities, but take the easiest way.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see a color on Quader and sphere, click on the button and then call the preview window.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is set right now. if you rendering your image with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color scheme. you need to enter two new attributes. in the color list you need to select two new attributes. then select this entry twice (you can do this too, but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Please select in the object-tree each time and change the colors in the view of the object features:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already be able to perform this step, as you should have the fundamental working class of & kpovmodeler; already understood. the ball lets you create as easy as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object features, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (don't forget the BABETASTE or button application), so the ball has floating over the floor, as you have moved the floor around a unit down downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course the rendering is now a strange result: as before, the ball-surface looks like a Mattes black material. put in the following step to a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material now. as already at the ground, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select replacement object and change the name for instance in the sphere of pigment. click the ball's pigment, then select one-in and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screen photos and click Apply or press the ONE GABETASTE.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The attitudes of gloss effect and reflection produce already some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even when metal is not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of it, which offers you & kpovmodelers. hopefully, you have already learned so much you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytrayjumps is a Render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you have a scene raytracts, the rendition of hypothetical radiance from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera, which rendering scenes) is broken and broken through any pixels of light sources in the scene and like atmospheric effects, such as fog. so the scene is processed for pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see without a camera, the camera is your eye to look at the scene. without a light source, you also see nothing, the image is simple black. obviously, any scene does not need to be moved, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual File dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file which you have previously prepared with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open a new model or create a new model, the file will be added to this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you already saved the model, it is saved by the same name. it is a new file, you need to enter a name and a storage place.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restoring the scene in the last saved version. any changes since the last storage has been discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">You can only select this menu entry only if you don't have any stored changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the recently reversed command. select this menu entry only if you have used editing.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog, in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or cover an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu, you can find options for the setting of & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, key shortcut and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Open a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can use this option prefix for & kpovmodeler; command commands or add new commands.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens up a dialog to set the toolbars. you can add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodelers; commands and remove commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump-map is an option to handle rough surfaces, without changing every whip on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a Bump-Map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric forms which you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these plots. these models will then continue to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">One texture map is a way to give the surface of an object's color to pixel-based, using an image file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser. the application has a file browser, you can select images for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can either be displayed in a private window in size of the image, or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & ball show; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can view with the Click & LMBn; or show the return Return.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can adjust whether any image will appear in your own window, or if all pictures are always to use the same window.</seg>

<seg id="1182">You may need to set existing multimedia buttons so that it will work as & amarok; short command. thereby, make your keyboard to & amarok, control centre.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface from Amarok has many general functions that are generally used in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and should describe the DCOP functions from collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlists browsers and scripts. an example call for the DCOP function could be & zb; look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command-line options of Qt and & KDE; in addition, Amarok has some own command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should enter a feedback if the script can't be implemented because of a lack of addiction. please check in your script if all required modules are present and use dialog, so the user know why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Results require 'Korundum' Rescue error = 'Korundum (KDE binding for ruby) from cdebindings v3.4 is Required for this script.' dialog dialog --sorry '# {error}' exit</seg>
<seg id="1187">In folder scripts / template, you will find a lot of template-scripts in many different languages. they can be used as a base for your own scripts or simply use them to expand the required functions. you will quickly find that the writing of scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarc and Amarok. the easiest way is to use the command dcop; which each KDE installation should be taught.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow the execute of external programs and commands. usually the function exec () is used. in this way, dcop &gt; can be easily accessed. here, an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amarok; sends messages to all running scripts. to this reason, scripts will be able to monitor their default values and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore the events if there is no use.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure the script to display the dialog box. to store and store the setup data each script must take care of each script. when a script is started, Amarc sets the working folder on the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signals that a new piece will play. the script may now & zb; with DCOP features further information on the new piece (for example the metadata or the unit length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newVolume signals a change of volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Custommenclicked: subtle menu contains the path to the selected files of playlist if a user-defined menu entry can be used. to remove one's entry on the menu, you can use the dCOP function dcop amarok script addressful menuItem (submenitemtitle) to remove a entry. use dcop amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenitemtitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & amarok branches off, or if the user stops a script, send & amarok a script that signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed, for example storing files or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages that can be compressed using a webserver. such packages are basically normal Tar-Archive (.tar), which can also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2), which can clearly recognize an archive name such as Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages containing the Extended amarocscript. for this reason, you should rename your script packages right correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main critic must be executable (+ x), the remaining memory modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to obtain the file rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is done, you can download it on www.kde-apps.org and hang on the Wiki Script's page of & amarok on your entry to KDE-apps you should use the amarok category; scripts).</seg>
<seg id="1200">& amarok is an audio player for & KDE; & amarok, has many useful and powerful functions and is still surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & amarok, you can simply pull music simply into the playlist instead of having to go through endless menus. maybe you are looking for a very specific title of thousands in your collection. with & amarok, you'll find a piece for collecting browsers and the quick search will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Maybe you already have some playlists, but you can never decide which you want to hear? then the playlists browsers are exactly the right choice for you. and if your decision is still difficult, the dynamic mode and smart playlists automatically select the correct music after certain criteria.</seg>

<seg id="1242">& amarok is an audio player for Unix systems (such as & zb; Linux). more information can be found in summary of the features and gallery with screen photos.</seg>
<seg id="1243">AmaroK requires only the package Kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you need to have Kdelibs so installed (including those contained in the programs, because & amarok, requires some of them, e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide how to minimize Kdelibs.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD assumes that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of freedeskt.org. Gnome will therefore work, but Fluxbox will cause trouble. we try to support amaroK on all platforms, so we use ketbs and Qt, because they are preparing an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will find a bug in the TagLib library for days. you can also delete the file by sending in ~ / .kde / share / apps / amarok file to bugs.kde.org and also depend on the broken file that caused the crash. thereafter you can delete the file and leave the collection again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Mostly this is that Taglib on reading the meta-infos from this file crashing. please report this bug to the Taglib developer among bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, then try again SQLite. support for this in & amarok is something more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of & amarok used libraries were compiled with the same Compiler Version. if, for example, & amarok, with GCC 3.4, TagLib but with GCC 3.3.x compiled, this leads to collapsing the meta-information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE using artsd then turn off machine. turn off when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or use at least no value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace of e-mail (the e-mail opens automatically at a crash) when it is a common crash when it comes to a good backtrace, the error will be solved.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is how many program can write data as UTF-8 to the meta-infos, but this is not described as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>

<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarokapp: symbol lookup error: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixmapERK7QPixmap, then check whether amaroK used the correct Qt library. this can see with ldd'ancokapp '_ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you possibly need to remove any collizing Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf to adjust the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are some possibilities. most installation problems are easiest by the help of an expert your unix or Linux distribution. you can also find help in other users or developers. use the Forum and IRC under irc.freenode.net in the channel # amarok.</seg>

<seg id="1259">After the start of & amarok, only an empty playlist. how do music pieces come in there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is easy. use the file browser on the left side and open the desired folder. then drag the files into the right part of the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1482">The settings of & k3b;. here you can set up general programming settings. nearly all the features of & k3b; should work on Anhieb. this dialogue is intended for personalise and adjusting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is how many other & KDE; applications also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions, you can use either the command line dcop, or the somewhat more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the functional scope, so rather your taste and type of your task is crucial that the associated programs you give.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume that you can use the command line dcop. to use the & DCOP; functions, you must make sure that & k3b; started. then give something like the following in the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that have all & KDE; -program in common, supports & k3b; mainly two other parts below are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The Standard DCOP interface from & k3b; displays functions such as copyCD, formatDVD and other features to create new projects.</seg>

<seg id="1490">K3b offers the installed K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectinterface, which can only be used on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">CreateFolder (QString name) and createFolder (QString name), addUrl (KURL url, QString), addreseItem (QString path) and renameItem (QString path, QString), seteumeID (QString path)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple file, and then insert files into the new folder:</seg>

<seg id="1494">& audiocreator; is an audio CD; -reader for & KDE; with it you can easily read audio CD; s read and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudioCreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (comp for reading & CD; file data in WAV files to the hard disk) and supported by many coders, which are compatible to MP3, oggenc for OGGs and FLAC (lossless compression). more coders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the titles of the & CD; read and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually a per title) will be compressed into MP3- or OGG format or even in other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, read out & CD;, it is used by & audioCreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other codierer have already been installed, so it is highly unlikely to compile something itself. but if the FLAC does not use it, the installation is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which Kodierer- / file format should be used? the Chapter Welver Kodierer gives a small introduction to Kodierer, audio quality and compressing factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying of protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudioCreator; cdparanoia to read the protection, it is not possible to avoid an protected audio CD; not allowed in any case & audioCreator; even not the mechanisms of copy protection. avoid easily the purchase of copier audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only once (the setup dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration is found), afterwards the daily use of a & CD can be explained to the hard disk. this leads (hopefully) to understand the user's slim approach to which you frequently stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which Kodierer programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the FreeDb from the internet or can work completely without network, where everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is only a brief list of commands given by the main fender. on the page, for example, you can find more information, such as this program will be used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the program types.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Start the CDDB on request of CD data according to the CDDB tab. (this may be locally or online, in the latter case first must first be connected to the internet.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if a encoder is configured in the tab tab, tab - the coding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoder, so that the selection can be read with another encoder as the default. it is too aware that the encoder's encoder settings are configured in the opening dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Open the file manager, so that a file format is selected to encode instead of a full & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Set the dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as protocols, piepsen) for programming events (such as reading the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Open the main dialog dialog by & kaudioCreator; with different card cards (such as encoder, to set up the encoders). here you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, codicals and compression rates, and helps you to choose the right Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other like 'shorts' or 'monkey' that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, you lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG likes an easy advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate, the differences are less important because both Kodiers produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'nt so 'free, lame will be delivered free with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high sound quality (with high bitrates) but compared with OGG slightly lower quality in lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is heard from one machine or calculator-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG-playing equipment is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - If music is to be heard on other devices such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special auto-stereo devices. today - at the beginning of 2009, these tools mostly support MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list with parameters for audio quality and from resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This attitude gives good transparency to most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--compression standard '= This attitude is usually offered to most people and most musical pieces of acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and some less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of titles. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR shared stereo, compression rate approx. 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good Genug for music of young people, portable devices and autostereoplants. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo devices.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting is exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you don't want the absolute top quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information stored manually or automatically fetched through the program from FreeDb via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can be delivered / used by & kaudioCreator; and the code program to create folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with co-programs there is often a combination of programming settings for the Kodierer and these parameters here. the manual or help to the Kodierers explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; titles to the keyword (English: day) if MP3s must be coded with lame, the switch -tt from lame and the title parameter of & kaudioCreator; added. the result looks as follows: '-tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audiocreator; parameters which can be used (= buttons in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what FreeDb is: a free database, in which persons can read / enter the information, so that all other information can be downloaded instead of yourself in the machine. it is too aware that here it is only spoken of text: & CD; title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; more or less valuable, so it cannot be added to the artist nor the music company damage. all information can be given at a bumblebee through a & CD; business, physical or virtuell.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudioCreator; you can actively choose a check box (sending an address) as those used in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears, the email address will not be used when retrieving data from the server (This can only know the programmers that has reviewed the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & audiocreator; for use of FreeDb, the geographic will be used to use the next mirror server. this saves bandwidth on the network and resembles the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of fried eggs for the online retrieval of & CD; information during reading one & CD;. alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the update of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">What programs do you use to store pieces from the & CD to save files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There is rumours that cdparanoia is used, search in source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; s. to note, that the cdparanoia package must be installed first if this is not done yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For storing the selected WAV files, the code can be selected and thus the desired file format can be selected. during the first opening, there are pre-defined entries for 'lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compression of audio data) on the setup of the code. other coders can be added to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed from the linking linux distribution, before the Kodierer can be used. this is also necessary for the customized Kodierer. more information on Kodierer are in the chapter Welver Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installation of a code you can receive further information on its switch by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; Console). thereby, 'lame' will be replaced by the name of the installed Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check out the device code of the & CD; / DVD drive, write and read listeners on your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;). try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. that could give a hint on what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD; read the shell of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step-by-step example. even if you use other settings, you can give this tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, all understood, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to establish those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will launch the program for the first time, setting up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1.</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. however, it's not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do the source files.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd insists and that you have scream on it (eg; by copying the Konqueror something into it).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section is treating the basic set of & audiocreator; something that is thought to be done just once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the approach to read a & CD which needs to be repeated for each release & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the resulting codierer for compression of music (lame) and audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program to use the FreeDb to download the & CD; data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not be able to read a & CD in any case if the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device model is handed over to the program program to read the & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device code of your drive. if this is not working or if more than a & CD; / DVD drive is available, a view into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The map of General settings. there is not much to do here. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything will be shown / entered as shown in screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only if you want to notify incomplete information, so that you will be informed of information regarding the generating reference (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and release the & CD; data automatically displays the internet of a FreeDb machine.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the calculator must be connected during the reading of the & CD; to be connected to the internet, so that it can access the FreeDb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selective field is easier, becomes a & CD; entry is found immediately if you are unhappy with the database entry and the resulting directory name / filenames or tag files, can easily be changed. the directory and file name will be changed and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & KDE; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Aside from this example, you will continue to note: if you want to enter everything manually, if you want to download the database before. however, it is possible to use FreeDb locally within offline mode, but if you need to use FreeDb in the offline mode, the two selection fields will have to be selected, at least the first. mode is set up on the card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us FreeDb. these are attitudes for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from FreeDb server via the internet. how does the system know which data will get the CD? read the section via FreeDb. please read the section on FreeDb.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to side freedb.org and look after a mirror server in your closeness. on this way, the load is distributed between the machines. however, this attitude will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work as equivalent to the server, as many firewalls operate the protocol 8880 in standard, there is maybe more luck with the protocol 80, as the & HTTP; protocol usually is open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to transmit any & CD; data on FreeDb servers. the first check box should be disable.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from screen photo. (make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous pieces: apologies, is there a reason why more than one at the same time when using only one existing drive? parallel reading and encode? the author doesn't know, hence try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: cross this to the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folders for temporary files: when you cross this, it can be useful if only if only space is available on another drive, the box is not enabled, the files will not be specified in the private folder. don't forget this folder when you want to make yourself some with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All around as it is on the screen photo. the command is somewhat long, under circumstances a little bit blotted to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned, it is an attitude for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi system. the resulting bit rate is approximately 224 to 256 kpbs. the compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the limitation of tags on version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can be erased in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the names of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest like in screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">The number of encoded WAV files: at a Dualcore or Quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than a wav file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic set of & kaudioCreator; it is completed. this configuration is used as default for each output of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change them again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section is described, as the process of reading the & CD; on the hard disk is run. we will create MP3 files. first, a connection to the internet is set up, as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from FreeDb want to pick up. the process that is described in this section has to be repeated for each release & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we have a & CD which is not included in FreeDb, you will see screen photos a little different than the dates for one & CD; with successfully released FreeDb, you will learn the & CD; data will be manually able to transfer them out of the Internet. comments are drawn to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not the & CD; this example can be found. it is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, now the & CD, into the drive, which was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in screenshot. this only if the & CD; as an audio CD, could be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen then you are looking for questions and answers to help or go back to the previous section regarding the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD can be picked up successfully by FreeDb, all tracks of the pieces are already filled and in addition, the name of the artist and album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; gives, a window is displayed, and you can select the database entry, which your opinion is best to your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have the check box for the automatic query of FreeDb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also solve this manually by selecting the first button on the toolbar. if you don't have any local database, it will need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 2: the CD Editor - entry of the CD-data and title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Specify the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen picture. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Refeller title', the rest of the data in an input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist does not have to be entered in an input field 'Refeller Title', unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments inidisparell per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments which are common to all the pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from FreeDb the CD editor is not empty, but it is always a good idea to review the contents of the CD editor, so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album names (e.g. all words with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any undesired comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this is limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary sector. if you set up ID3v2 tags, you have set out unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudioCreator; maximum. this option is allowed on the tab card settings; take a look inside the section 'basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags: not supported by all coders or file formats. see in the help of the Kodierer in order to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Just select an entry, obviously with the style of the read CD; matches. in this example, this is not important since we do not transmit the & CD file. for more information, please go to the site of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD-editor appears again and you can see that the fields for the album is already filled with the given data, which we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. the title of the piece for each case and other information you want.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and process you in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD; entered.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window doesn't appear if you have downloaded the data from FreeDb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of toolbar. note that the artist and album are displayed above the list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check sign before each line of a piece. just the title indicates the selection of the piece or out. make sure all the pieces are selected, or do the button all pieces select at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">It has been launched by clicking on the button selection of reading the reading process, so this window appears to confirm. OK, and then we will take a look at the window with the essays and track what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the rider orders to switch off on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window for checking orders. the first piece is read on the hard disk. the status of the program will be displayed in the left bottom of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message appears when you're trying to work with a Kodierer, which you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully coded with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the target file is not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked whether you have writing access to the folder for the temporary files and the target file?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error has occurred right after the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece of it, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3. thus, check out and encode in parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and encode. the used machine with a amd64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous interpreting and encode (of however two different pieces).</seg>

<seg id="1609">This section is directed to persons, compiled by source files, and not intended for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help like the program can be adjusted if it is running, then the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls for many different programs, has many variants of settings. best read the step in step example of the settings and settings. it shows screen photos of different input cards and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still read on? even if only the help menu has been clicked up after the first start of the program, it should go on from this somehow empty screen (especially if the program starts up not an audio CD; in the drive), or from an unusually short menu.</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it? who reads this, probably has started the program. it should look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no email. the author can't reckon this manual. it is thought as the first version of a manual to & audiocreator; thought. who is always something useful to add or change it, may it do. at least only after contact with the author. and if you read this, he has to leave this section and is therefore agree with this proposal.</seg>

<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the Midi- and Karaokespieler of & KDE; besides others, he does not have some properties with real-time graphics and karaoke-screen highlighting of texts also, the other & UNIX; -MIDI players don't have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS and & KDE; support. & kmid; supports the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver, which is used for GUS cards. Alsa is included as soon as it supports a sequenzer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color, so it is easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphic presentation of the activity of each MIDI channel due to highlighting of the compressed buttons on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & Drop so that you can drag & KDE; each MIDI file from one & Konqueror; window on KMid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files (song events or text events). KMid automatically determines the procedure used automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Seat support. if you finish & KDE; during the play of a song, KMid starts again with the same song.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select... from the menu file. it appears the usual file dialog, with whose help you can choose the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from one & Konqueror; window in the & kmid; window, this works also with multiple songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and get the button playing in the tool bar, select the entry matches from the menu (or insert the space bar).</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece starts automatically as soon as you push it on the & kmid; windows. (with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played in succession.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; a piece plays, you can jump in any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="1629">When you find that a song is too fast or too slow down, you can click on the left and right of the speed display and so check the speed speed. to get back the original speed, double-click on the tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the button Pause or the Select of the menu entry in the menu, interrupts the playback. do not play the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Liedtexte can be stored on two types in a piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics event and another both. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set up what events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined, so that you have nothing to adjust the entry automatic text code, so you will automatically have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other type.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set up an event type, choose from the menu settings the entries text events or push-up events. the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summarize. these are played the number after. in this section, how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the Collection Manager. you will find in the menu collection under the point. click here on New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by copying copying and then select the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can adjust the changes in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection, all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not stored. consider that when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, you have to add a song in the collection manager, where you can add a song. again, the file dialog, with whose help you can choose the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setting automatic Add to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If automatic add to the collection is activated, a piece of opening (using file opening or drag & drop) is automatically added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic add to the collection is not enabled, when opening a piece the temporary collection is enabled and eert. this collection will then be added to the opened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection, select the collection and select the desired song and then click on removing.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the sequence in which the songs can be played off. if you choose a series from the submenu setting of the menus, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or select or select random order in the menu, the order is specified.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the Collection Manager, or use the select list on the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song, select the button Next song, the next song from the menu, or press the button arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the button, select the previous piece from the menu, or press the button arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the Collection Manager, choose the delete collection and click on the button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, it doesn't matter, as it is not stored in the leaving & kmid; not stored.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers who are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events in events which understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI-map, converts all the events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and thus allows a trumpet to sound when originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you don't need MIDI-map because all sound cards are compatible (including Awe and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI-maps. so you have to edit the corresponding file from hand (using your favorite image editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-map is a text file, which stores all necessary conditions for playing a piece of play.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section can only appear once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear so often as desired. prerequisite, however, that each appearance possesses a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "Name of the Keymap"... END Define KEYMAP "Another keymap"... END Define CHANNELMAP... END options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an email, so I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can be used for devices which are not General-MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, as the patches of General MIDI is displayed on your specific keyboard, the general use as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equation is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you can't change the sequence and no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is needed to lay all the sounds that you need to put on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM-patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a telector. in addition, you can bear the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if now a MIDI file is playing a note with Patch 127 (the drummer), patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch is meant, in which every tone is a different percussioning instrument (drum, pelvis, maracas & etc;), and not the one in which the sound meaning the pitch is the same drum (as some keyboard boards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to specify how sounds on a certain channel or instrument is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as its presence. you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keyboards are used mainly to form frequencies onto the percolt-channel. check out as an example the included keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to convert some channels to others. if you want to change the first and second channel, make it easy in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is displayed on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the corresponding keymap must be defined on the front in the file. if you want to change the ForcePatch option, all events will try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, the patch is always used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The option ForcePatch can be useful for example to always use the perkish patch on the perkward channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value of PitchBenderRatio indicates, in which relationship of Pitch-Bender events will be converted with the value n, this is used with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then first forwarded. the value 4096 is used, so that no decimal number is reported in the Map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed, because GM ensures that a pitch is to play a Pitch-Bender event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards with two tones can be found up to one octave. to find the correct value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. you will find in the menu below settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The canalview is a window with a whole range of piano (one for each MIDI channel). on these pivials you see which sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel there is a select list where you can select an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (until now) has two different views to display the played sounds. view in the menu settings under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The Tempo-LCD display the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. so, for example, find a song be too fast to follow the text, you can slow down. to change the pace, use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about it, like a piece of music, it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc;. thereby, the same MIDI file can lead to two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anyone, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3-file requires a similar sound quality (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer, you can also modify the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control of everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have compiled a binary form (rpm, deb) of & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support compile. to remove the problem, you need to download and install the source code (e.g. from kmid; 's home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore supports & kmid; Drag & Drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & Konqueror; choose all files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Enable the default to be automatically added to the collection. otherwise, the files are added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can switch the arrow keys to the left by the Tempox LCD to slow down the playback. to restore the standard tempo, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have installed on one & KDE; -Desktop with my MIDI file and & kmid; on this desktop (if I want to play a karaoke file) or checked (if I want to play a karaoke file) or if I want to play a file, just enter the & Konqueror; windows to change and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen quickly a file, without adding it to a collection, turn off the setting automatic Add to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose that you have MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. you only want to play the first file. so, make the setting automatic Add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection contains exactly this a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then disconnect, including B.mid and C.de to create and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you so much! if I hear this song or see the postcard, I animate myself, further on & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Laga (Spain). at the moment I'm not much free time for my Hobbies, but I'm trying to collect a bit of time for my Hobbies, but I'm trying to collect MIDI files, make music and propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where you can download MIDI / karaoke files if you want a question, a mistake or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you just want to make me happy, please write an e-mail: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me a huge upgrade if you send me a postcard from your home town or a Midi- / karaoke file from a local group. if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file, but if you want to send a MIDI file, you should contact me, as I already have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and nobody can tell anyone about it. I would like to emphasize that I will just get another advantage because / if I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, as the sound quality depends on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use an FM device or an AWE card.</seg>

<seg id="1710">It's possible to enrich the preferred links under the menu Bookmark, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchies. if you have an entry, his group and all its subgroups are copied to the current category, and playback begins with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' Current News', Television and Permanent playlist may also be changed by editing the XML configuration files. naturally, you can only do that by an editor, but also through the application itself. click on a name of a category clicks, as well as next editing mode. thanks to the clicks of a subgroup, the XML content is displayed only.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, the menu has to be selected with playlist and select either the edit mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">Any changes have lost if the edit mode is left or another group is selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author & kmplayer, some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation for starting and end can be disabled through editing of ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc and Change of [general Options] No Intro = 0 obpler option to '1'. if the option is not available, it can easily be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate any other animation. & kmplayer; will be the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / unit.xml. the format must be an supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation you don't need to be short, it will automatically end by opening a different source. however, this would be disturbing at the end of animation, but the user can end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the ads of a favorite photos: & lt; Supported; & lt; IMG dur = "file: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif =" file: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif = "file: / / / home / caults.gif; & lt; / bodysuit; In the list testing / some examples of SMIL those of & kmplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider for the configuration of MPlayer in configuration dialog by & kmplayer; here, the path can be set up from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here is the output of MPlayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this rendition in configuration dialog by & kmplayer; everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc. here is an example of how a 'flash' is played with the 'swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & kmplayer; it can even be inserted into the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>

<seg id="1725">The conqueror or & kmplayer; is used in a consoles application and search for error messages related to the browser's browser window. if no error occurs, the backend output is called inside & kmplayer; (view, console or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">So that there is always a pre-given backend for a specific Mime type (of course only if this has been determined), this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc. for example, phonon all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can play TV cards either by MPlayer or Xvideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be checked, the scanner can be used from configuration dialog, or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (video data recorder) settings in kmplayer, the dialog can be found in the settings below - &gt; Quetzle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. to be selected, the correct coding needs to be found (e.g., PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a DVB.</seg>
<seg id="1729">As the VDR support of kmplayer can only use XVideo (probably this kind of playing video equipment under Linux), this is also supported only on the first screen (: 0.0). this is why the videoforlinux must be functioning for the X server. therefore, the XFree86 server must therefore be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>

<seg id="1754">Document categories: this is hereditary: articles (article), book [book], letter [report], article [report], report (DIN) [scrvcl], book (DIN) [scrbook], projector [beamer], films [Prosper] or custom.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Encoding: this is hereby set the character encoding. it should use the character encoding of the system. modern systems increasingly use UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best, UTF-8x should be used (for correct processing of the & latex; -documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most frequently used packages for & latex;. for the integration, they are only managed only in the cross field.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Articles (DIN), book (DIN), report (DIN), letter (DIN): the document classes of Koma-Script (to comply with German DIN regulations). you should always use German text files.</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users are not worried anymore. it is only a brief description of the functions and further information in this section are given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& kile; also offers - just like other source code editors - the highlighting of used commands, settings and elements (as well as the inappropriate). by & kile; you should have noticed any mathematical environment. however, it is still noticed by the modest appearance of output file. however, it will save you by highlighting time and tap.</seg>
<seg id="1760">By entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) by & kile; automatically creates a blank line (for entering the text) and the addition line for the command set (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be set off in the menu settings; set up LaTeX commands.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into some elements. & latex; the subdivision of the document in the following elements (part is the most beautiful and subset element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In view of the document in the structural view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective level.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating the own & latex; files can be very helpful. once a DVI; file [linear file] has been created, jumps & tile; by a click with the medium mouse button in DVI; viewer at the corresponding line in & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font type of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools to view, converting and to print out DVI; -Files for various systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the RÃ ¼ rtsp search, the elements of the DVI; file with the editor is shortened, and once upon an item in the DVI; source code, the exact opposite is the exact opposite of it. once upon a section in the latex; source code was clicked; it is presented to the corresponding item in DVI; viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used for work with multiple files. with a master document the work is simplified using other integrated .tex files. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be adjusted for project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick assembly: the latex; source code will be compiled and the result is automatically displayed (if there are no errors in source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File customization: in this mode, the DVI; file is mounted on an alarm system, and there is no appeal by & Okularline; after the quick assembly.</seg>
<seg id="1769">In viewing the processing tool bar, the three main selection fields should be developed into the document. the first select box is designed for quick setup of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The veritable & latex; -commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection box Further is for entries in articles such as keywords, merging, notes, or references. these activities are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: this command will create a designation for a section, a picture or different element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for reference to a fixed name (select a selection box).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a select list will be displayed with literary entries. for & BibTex files, this only works if the file is necessary to a project. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib; - the & BibTex; -files can also be written in & kile; written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop down with the name Grislanders is used for the definition of font names. it can be noted the font size for the main text, the joints etc., etc. are the following font names are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">At the call of & khaste; there are two choices for completion: 1. the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document type and legend settings. 2. the document may be written by reason to hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Brackets on the command\\ 's class contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] defines the font size. if the font is not specified at the beginning, this can also happen in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code has been entered, the & latex; source code has to be compiled. the easiest way to this is the use of mentioning or of the button quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before compiling. & hurry; for storing the storage automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">The compiling of the document fails, should be searched in the logging after errors. if using fast, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be respected.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (English environment) is a text that is treated differently than the remaining document. for example, a report with the font size is made. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} encourages the number of lettubing in the environment - bbing a giant-tubbing. (English Huge).</seg>
<seg id="1781">These are only supported within the environment (of\\) {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no restrictions (number) for foreign exchange within one environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many opportunities to listen to the reading and user friendliness of the document. it can be used for example certain fonts, fat pressure, cursive printing, submissions, etc. these commands are either using the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ '{stamps}: this command is available for the course of courses until it is closed with a\\' s {emph} or another environment. a single word in a set can be represented by\\ 's {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ Quote: creates a quote from the document. the quote begins with\\ '{Quote} and ends with\\ end {Quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to writing the source code with the & latex; file language is presented, now a step-by-step guide for the creation of a document in & kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once the wizard was entered a bit text, a few adjustments should be performed for better readability of the document. there should be a quote from a few positions in the fat and cursive printing and a poem to the application to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, it can be turned back to editor by Editor-View or Ctrl E (internal viewer). an external viewer must be closed at an external viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI-file has been created, the document can be printed or converted into one & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a large file format. these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF -converting or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file, the same steps as for the preparation of the document (see). in the 7th step - can be printed on DVI, then you can print the document using file printing (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar does not encourage the conversion of DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; file was created from the & latex; source code, the conversion can start into the toolbar using the buttons used in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The forward-looking forward guide the direct jump from the editor to add-to-one position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; provides a corresponding setting for all & latex; -Binders. to do this, only Modern will have to set up cile settings...</seg>
<seg id="1794">To select the pre-draft solution, the mouse indicator has to be positioned in one line of the source codes and will be clicked on preheat-looking. the jump to the corresponding place in DVI; viewer is then done.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with one click of the medium mouse button in DVI; document the corresponding & latex; -Document of & kile; set up and to the corresponding line. this must be set up & drop; in & eyepiece; set up as text editor (settings eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If using high-speed the & DVI-viewer use, an error can be found. if an error occurs, it should be shown in the log file or in the news window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file Erklash the error source in source code. in the editor, there is always the line in which the error appears. in order to view the flawed line, the log file has to be clicked on the logging, navigating immediately to the error in the logging line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once on the corresponding button in the tool bar is clicked, a window to selecting the template is displayed. the default entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting a document, a document may be written either by reason to new or the assistant to rapid creation of a new document. further information in this section are included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Common users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created in & cile; created, stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new model, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file can be created or a new file. & kile; can create a new template by creating a existing document and create a selection of file template from document.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document using file New, some character strings will be replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings... settings will be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating the own template, it is necessary to know what character strings be replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string will be replaced by entering document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\\ 's $DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {items}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the assistant and the associated entry into the editor. once the document has been created this way, the following steps were accomplished:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, the own template can be selected instead of standard sizes.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files created. will be a simple way to create a template, should be searched for one in the internet and searched the steps below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & Kate; used as an internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmers and highlighting of many different types of text files (including & latex; and & BibTex;). many settings for & Kate; can be made out directly in the menus.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about Kate's & Kate; and to learn his friends, the manual should be attracted to Kate. users of & kile; can also be downloaded directly with reading the chapter works by & Kate;</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; offers a very practical & latex; -command reference, which can be called upon the Menus Help LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in & latex; use as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with penetrated Ctrl key to increase the & tex; -word. that means that in this way, click on the\\ par\\ associated skip\\ par\\\\\\\.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When pulling the text with penetrated linker mouse button, the fully-balanced text is automatically copied into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with penetrated switch, parts of the source text in the Editorwindow will be radiated.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; has the ability to browse these different types of source codes and emphasize. for example, the latex; -commands from normal text and also the mathematical forms are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">A lot of assistants in the text marks. it is an own type of reading marks within the text. the menu entry, or the corresponding key stamp, is emphasized that it is also highlighted in the first entry of a drawing automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The processor is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like & kile;. although & Kate; already excellent breakfasts have been added; & latex; important features for the writing of a & latex; source codes for their selection. under processing tools, the following commands are included to the text selection:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Displays a complete paragraph (group of rows, which included on both sides). this extended meaning will not include a text with continuous lines, i.e. tables, latex; -commands and all other lines of source codes. the only preventive thing in & kile; is that the waste is separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">The word appears below the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended importance, as this command also contains & latex; -commands with a mixed star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">For sale of a part of the document can be removed from this first and off the button. & Kate; offers the keychain Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & kile; offers its own commands for a faster speed. under editing, the following commands are included in the text of the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete unit. definition for a paragraph in & kile; is included in the description to edit output.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It was already clear that environments can play a central role in & latex; therefore, & kile; for more commands in an active environment for a perfect simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). cursor will be placed directly before the command to create the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command will jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). cursor will be placed directly behind the command to close the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is before or within the instruction\\ begin}, it will jump to the end of the surrounding area (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering a lot of softened ambient commands, the view can be lost rapidly. this command will close the last-made environment, so that the ambient structure is not distorted.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also offers special commands for latex; groups that are determined by staples {...}. under Edit TeX group are some important commands that correspond to the processor.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command will jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). cursor will be placed directly in front of the welded bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command will jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). cursor will be placed directly behind the soft clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is before or behind the soft clamp of a & tex; group # is located at the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">During the typing of many welded groups in brackets, this command can be lost rapidly. this command will close the last-made group, so the Waxed structure of the & tex; groups are not divided.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple touch characters used to be used. for the purpose of this purpose is used in & kile; the sign is used for two simple touch characters. also available for the demonstration of the beginning. & kile; knows this case and covers two prevalent test characters for latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic one of the double initial sign can be set up under Settings... LaTeX and be eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1833">There are also specific settings (e.g. nst or French) and thus can be used by German or French specialties. there are also many more languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When you can switch from Shift; ONGABETASTE for a smart line breaks. if the current position is located within a lists -environment (e.g. skate or itemize), it has a line breaks, but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">In a tables area close t & kile; the current line with\\\\\ 's line with an enclosed line break off.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & kile; is intelligent enough to emphasize voicing & latex; - or user-defined environments. these can be set up under settings; set up LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users can arrange the columns in tables environments, and all Et characters (amp;) among each other. & kile; try to be able to encourage you. although this postulator is not the addition of the table, it is possible to add up & ile; some intermediate space for the columns position of the current tabators.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & Kate; already has a good source code full of code, it has been added to & kile; for specific commands (mostly for & latex;), three according to need and the other two are implemented for the automatic transfer. all these modes are set up for different workstations under Settings... to set up...</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning of a new environment using the\\ 'command} it will add & drop; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} according to an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When the switch is checked, the last letter of entry will be removed and understandable, ERT thus becomes the complete list. on the other hand, the list may also reduce the list by entering a further letters.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a brief description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions are complied with selection of a command. alternatively, jump stamps are possible, so that a simple jump to these positions is possible by using the lightest stamp marks, and the seasoned parameters can be folded.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Set up atile; set up... khaste; set free settings to these lists. there can be different parts lists for xtex; - and & latex; -commands as well as diameter of the general language used.</seg>

<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for formatting / script / etc; language. then you'll need to create the docrc file. let the first part we leave you to the second we treat here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc you = pad, relative to this file, for example php42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these documentations, e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Section 2 = Sec2.html-2 = tors 2.html-2 = tag2html-2 = tag2html-3 = day.html-3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree produces the visible portion of documentation in the document tree. for example, see now in the & PHP; documentation:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc you = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = index.html Getting Started = Introduction,... Introduction = dextion.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = long-synchron.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this shows that it is a subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for chess problems (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents are referenced directly to a file (and consequently the upper end of the construction supervision & mdash; file is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Space characters influence nothing, but watch out & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; ressources will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The section section is the range of docrc file, which is to be shown to the design of the context-sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; -Script the documentation would display the mysql _ fetch _ array function. there are only two types of entries here. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file association-lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separated context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc and make up to $HOME / .kde / share / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / etc / quanta / doc or copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are well and worth being shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation were used to the & quantaplus; -Repository for the use by the & quantaplus; -Repository for the use by the & quantaplus; -Society. they will not be rich, but proud of being involved in the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the herniated resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent via email to friends, partners or else. at different places there is an e-mail menu entry, as DTD DTD Package (DTEP) with email, toolbar toolbar with email, in context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, where all other & quantaplus; users are checked and only made available for the publication. in order to sign a useful contribution, we recommend to sign the resources for a GPG / PGP key. thus, the source of resources guarantees, both for our team and for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you will be asked for their passphrase for their private GPG key (the passphrase is not stored), or in the case that you have multiple keys, you may have an exit. in the dialogue New resource you will have to stay empty (URL-preview can be empty) and with clicking OK the upload.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Upload the upload DTD DTD Package (DTEP) to upload factory toolbars, and can be started in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, nor before installation, examines & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and the signature. if the integrity is given and the resource is correct, a message appears with the name of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages which is currently not supported by & quantaplus; however, creation can be time-consuming, because hundreds of tag files can be necessary in day XML format. there is easier way to convert DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD Store and Converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description, which is to be used. afterwards the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Objective name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE Definiration line: the string that is used in! DOCTYPE tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">For the course of the DTEP after the conversion: if enabled, & quantaplus; after converting the & descriptionrc; -Editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. in order to understand this and full use of & quantaplus, you must first create this fundamental concepts with these fundamental concepts. this chapter attempts to bring them closer to these concepts, without their understanding & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, locally and projects. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; available. from toolbars over actions is everything that is marked as global, in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators, different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are available to each in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements present a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local items are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; - patterns up to toolbars with special actions especially for the files of a specific project. simply said, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder's tree, making the common use of special tools and patterns of all the staff within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editorch window, the building views, the cartons with information and the toolbars. please check in and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the boxes with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document passable entries, like close to the current, other or all the boxes, restart, or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the Editorarea leads to another context menu on the processed document content, such as basic editing steps (copying / paste / paste), processing the word under the mouse pointing device or open the file, if the string is described below the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the Editorfensters are the toolbars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of toolbars will be shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus; the toolbar will be adapted to the new functions and thereby associated user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert into their document, then click the symbol that represents the day. if you want to insert the data for this just inserted day. if you want to add some attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The construction views (QIT;) allow to navigate in the information about & quantaplus; to navigate, open and walk through. in the presentation with carteivers are available for files, project, pattern processes, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation construction views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all the files in the project using right mouseclick. actions such as adding, removal, upload or delete files from the storage medium can be done with the then shown context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; There are all possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which they are used. the category depends on & quantaplus; work area. global templates are always available, local templates only for the respective users and templates in projects are only useless in the project. more to templates are available.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information on the available scripts. the concept of inclusion in Global, Local and Project works here. by clicking on the left-hand mouse button, you can retrieve the available information on a script. via the right mouse button, further functions are available, such as the script, to edit or send an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by links-clicking of an elementary proposition, the cursor will set up the position of the element. by right-click of an elementary proposition opens a list of commands in relation to navigation and refreshment of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears below the other construction views. with it, some attributes and namespace can change with it. it allows to change the contents of all available attributes with a few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the Web-technique for your development. you can create your documentation for & quantaplus; you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be edited, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two cartels at the bottom of the window, which can be achieved using the beneficial information: the news window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This box shows information about each in Quanta running script. such as the DTD of current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This cardboard box shows all errors in the current document of the current document. & quantaplus; -scripts that are executed, do all error messages (such as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are expanded extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding order. the chocolate-page of the tool bar is the possibility to define independent commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a tool bar with Email. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed Tar archive over & kmail;. if they get a tool bar in an email, they can secure these in & quantaplus; like any other and download!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It's reasonable if you want to adapt the place of & quantaplus; files on your system. to get a complete list of all options, you give. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with starting & quantaplus, you should check whether your path contains the & KDE; 3 bin folder. also, you should ensure that no older version of & KDE; 3 in PATH before their bin folder. it is the same for & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; was optimized for a fast web development and combines a mature development environment with a wide range of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During an effort to create the best & HTML; the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus, an independent, extendable market-up languages would say? well, this would make it be the absolute most powerful web development tool for & KDE; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, & quantaplus; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then it should be & quantaplus; for the appropriate & IDE;</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the aforementioned claim must be kept that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & KDE; developer community is not only possible for someone else? thanks to the & KDE; -smells, not only this is possible, but it allows users and developers, & quantaplus; to expand as they need it for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web development to improve the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). through self-yesterday's actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost every task possible. through the program Komsomites you can see & quantaplus; extending without any scripts of scripting skills. (read more about it in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for quick web development and quickly developed to a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quanta; Plus is in any way connected with commercial versions of & quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in detail more detailed documentation is provided with help: / quanta (either enter this URL into & conqueror; help: / quanta run).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& quanta; is currently being developed and supported by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time when you open a file, which is not included, where the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for the later use. if you are trying to store the selected file / text outside the local / project presentation folder, only an error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converted to paste from the clipboard there, special characters used for & HTML; -Schedging, that it is correct and not to be understood by the browser as formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Convert the text from the clipboard in & URL; -Connect, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. first line to insert & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection. it allows you to select text blocks using the & shift; button to select.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. that's very helpful if your & PHP; -Script error message!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches for a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed, with GUI and predefined expressions, to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Shows the news window, or not. that's the window in which you see the advertisement of scripts and the Debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Training and switching of problem reporters at the lower edge of the & quantaplus; the problem center is activated once you changes to the structural tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Shows the symbol-old left from the main window. this column allows you to put bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">When reading bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu with entries of previous or next, depending on the cursor position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmark from other open documents appear in the menu after the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens a existing project from the hard disk. & quantaplus; projects are saved with the .webprj file extension.</seg>
<seg id="2128">To insert files to insert files into the current project. the selected files are then copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project list after new files that could be there. that enables you to copy graphics files into your project folder or a sub-folder and add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Downloads the files in your project on the server. the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of & KDE; and if you have a further input / output modules (Kio Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings such as & quantaplus; the project manages. in the chapter & quantaplus; projects you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Invites you to find a project tool. these are kept in Project / toolbars and are only in this menu, if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens up a dialog to add a new tool bar. these toolbars can be set up using settings. toolbars will be saved by tool toolbars or you will be asked when you want to store the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a tool bar from the point of view. it does not delete from the hard disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you will be asked whether you would like to do this.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send her own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; -Team, that the tool bar is present in the next release). the menu option opens a new EMail message with the toolbar as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the upload of toolbars onto the main server, where any other can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Charging a & DTD; that you or any someone else has and convert into the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / offset of the dutities from the & DTD; is meaningful if the dutities consist of the & DTEP; if this global is not present and a write permission in the global KDE file is not available, it fails to load the loading.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags provided in the currently loaded tool bar. if the standard (HTML;) tool bar is loaded, there is a sub-menu standard that contains the tags / actions on this tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day setup dialog, if there is one. this entry is always available in the menu tags, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activating or deactivated the intelligent insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent inserting means that & quantaplus means that insert the toolbar if this day has contradict the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-ins menu, the available plug-ins available under the menu option are listed below. click on. click to activate a activated plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Chooses the soundproofing mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemata depends on the makes; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of line characteristics. very useful if you know people using other OS platforms for developing. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Check the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using external use Tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of user interface. by some limitations in the KDE libraries, the switch can sometimes need time or innice graphics. recommended is the box office mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which is the default in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu for each open subwindow contains one entry. with a selection of a contract, the appropriate subwindow is activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches the display of the status bar at the lower edge of the & quantaplus; main track respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2150">Changes in this dialogue influence each application that use the KHTML role, including the & Konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Specifies the behaviour of the Editorfensters. in the documentation of & Kate; you find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbars or which can change and follow the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the environment's environment, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as at any open source project, developers can always use aid. if you want to support & quantaplus; development in financial form, find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled at the top of the bottom of the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project automatically completes. all these paths and author information fields can be later extended with Shift; F7 project project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. if you enter the name, file will be filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can find the server address of the machine, which one wants to access, except for local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used. depending on the remote user's setting, an adaptation could be needed.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a common collection of files used for different projects should be used instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the toolbars for the project is stored. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a common collection of files used for different projects should be used instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">That allows to add files from the local file system into the project. you can select multiple files or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you want to download and change it. if you want to download and change it. if you want to download and change it, you have to go differently with serversed scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc.).</seg>
<seg id="2164">If files, which are located somewhere in the main part of the project, will be set up. if a project is new, it will not be anhaken.</seg>
<seg id="2165">This option displays all files and folders within the main folder and you can take a precise selection of vouches.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main file. you can select the required files by checkbox or, by removing the hooks, out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be changed in the menu with Project Properties in the menu space in the menu profiles, or with the key shift Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistants and are described in detail. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholder possible), which are re-read for project-related operations such as project folder.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Complementary option on top, also files that are listed in .cvsignals are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded during opening of the project, can be read more about projections.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The desired debuggers can be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the debugger plug-in can be set with the button options. in this case, the bug fixes.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the subwindow profile, upload profiles (see in) can be set, as well the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by showing their own construction supervision for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the sub-window team configuration, project members may be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see details in the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the subwindow event configuration, you can switch event actions and add these actions, change or delete. event actions are executed once a certain event happens, such as the backing of a file. see in details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus opens; the last project that was opened. you can't influence this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select the project... from the menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar. the project will open, and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus; closed, the project file will automatically be stored. you will be asked whether you want to save changes before leaving when quantaplus; changed files. the same happens if you upload a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project supervision provides free access to the files in the project. there you can be administrated in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders are likewise, however, open the entries of opening and opening... in the context menu (with the right mouse button menu):</seg>
<seg id="2181">The profile can be selected here. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows the removal of the actual profile. if only a profile is available, the button is blown off to prevent removing removing.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will keep in the core memory and forgot on Programmer. this opportunity is useful if common uploading files is needed and the more unsafe password on the plate store does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or simply leave dialogue when you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many high load profiles can be uploaded and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded onto various servers. when editing or creating a profile will show this dialogue:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server name to be copied to files. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for the uploading. the list depends on the version of & KDE; and the installed Kio Slaves. at least you should choose from & ftp;, file (locally) and NFS can choose.</seg>
<seg id="2188">Port for transfer. normally, this does not have to be changed, except the network administrator runs a service not at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your Angstink, this is either a time-saving function or danger. use it according to your discretion. the password is stored on the plate, so it can't be read easily, but everyone with programmers can easily be seen in clear text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set files and toolbars. it can be loaded in a project by many views, i.e. by simple exchange of view, various files and toolbars can be loaded, and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored or deleted in the menu project or the project tool bar, accessible via Settings tool toolbar, open or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has to do most. this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to its own mode.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above are toolbars in & quantaplus; best above the toolbars toolbar. use and add-in. adding toolbars is described below in the section Add by toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Toolbars and symbols can be adjusted either via context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which with new action, will remove tool toolbars or toolbars, which can be specified in the dialogue, which may be indicated which actions should be visible on this or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menus to an action (symbol) on a tool bar, in addition to remove the entries promotion and action, that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can set up toolbars in the menu, setting tool toolbars... and set up actions.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are in the essential document skeleton, code cuts and files to link. & quantaplus; used templates basically like a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces. you can copy, postpone or any at the system's existing directory in the storage room. templates are set in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you have for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; supplied templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions indicated in the beginning of each template.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not pure text. it can normally be inserted in documents by links (e.g. images with IMG src = / src / url). some examples can be found in stock space under global templates. more information about the Templates tree is available in.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be done by any text document type. based on this templates, new documents can be created. normally more specific documents can be created in respective subfolders. it is usually done a simple scaffection for the purpose and organises the work in such a way to be efficient. some examples can be found in the storage room under global templates. see in for more information about the Templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document is based on a template but the same text area will always be inserted into the documents. you can find everything from a comment via a final menu system on Javascript or Perl base. some examples are available in stock room under global templates. see in for more information about the Templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates are for whole websites as templates. they are a collection of different documents organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure according to your (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select File As submission to store local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as this happened, you notice that (even if it was stored as a project template), the template is not visible in the project tree. check in the storage room under project projects.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click to store file as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can easily be drawn with pulling and drain on the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file is only able to copy only into one template folder. it can be used for all file management functions, such as pulling and inserting or insert over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder or in the project files tree view on a folder, click on the template's template and secure a name for the template. by default, it can be saved as local or global presentation.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project projects allow a very target-oriented approach. you can insert headlines and footer with & PHP; shape, insert files or link with them. additionally, you can keep some things using using templates in projects very profound in the eye.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files contained in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / Templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / Templates. each of this folder meets one of four types of containers, as described above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To determine the behavior of a folder is to click on the folder with the right mouse button and select in the context menu features. the following dialogue appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A select field with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is blinded when Elteristic attributes is disgusted.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and adapted for everything except for ordinary folders. if a regular file would be stopped, it would be explicit activated in this path except it would be explicit. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, it is likely to be found in a regular file.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allowed earlier or presented text for templates in this folder. this could be general scroll or footer for all templates for a specific project, allowing copying of contents into a folder with special headlines / footer a whole presentation already with the appropriate header lines / footer lines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, we have a text-up menu (showing the right mouse button) to add or copy and add templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & source code editor that can be reached via the menu. the first mode replaces the source code editor through the VPL; editor and the second is shared the editing window in two parts: the source code editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; Editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; - page and an cursor. then you can edit and when needed for source code editor, in which the changes in the VPL; -Editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor to a document that includes & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; file editor. to edit & PHP, it is still the source code editor. there are no plans to change this code.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly as the first, except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source code editor and in the VPL; editor synchron, this mode is already active, the keystroke uses the active cursor of a window to others, where the position is maintained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; -Editor and the source code editor is set to set up via Settings... After selecting VPL; -View may be set between synchronisation after one click or automatically. in general, the recommendation can be adjusted automatically. in principle, the recommendation can be adjusted for fast computer and a great span for slow computer.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so the processing of invisible tags is possible in working with the VPL; editor is also called upon, as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; -Editor, which is to change the hunter. so you can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-tags allow the storage of information on the document itself, e.g. whichwords for Internet search engines. meta-elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed. a click into the list allows the change of the input, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword Keyword 2 on the content.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the identification of pages in browser. you can add CSS rules using buttons below the list or delete. a change on the list is possible as with the meta-elements, which is currently not supported by CSS rules.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to bind an external CSS-style template by pressing the File button and select the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of cursor is like in a word processor, possible through due to the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor behaves as usual. text can be inserted as usual. text can be inserted by typing or shatter.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The tags of tags is made in the same way via the toolbars, as in the source code editor, it is necessary to note that the paste does not be inserted in identical identical tags, e.g. when an anchor tag is inserted with text, any other surrounding anchors must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some tool bar like the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled. they will later work in & VPL; they will need to work the tables or lists of toolbars.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphic tools for comparing. so why & diffdiff3;? let me explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributions made many changes, and at the same time the entry was corrected. another programmer had changed much text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts in merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me was only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly had changed within this lines. and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps only the insertion had changed. the merging of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could be differences within one line and changes to white signs. later, any quantity of further useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you want to compare text quickly, copy it simply into the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function which made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way co-merge is fully supported. this is useful if two people can work independently from one piece of code and changes. the original file (the base) helps the resolution of conflicts and shows at the same time the expected outcome. in this editor, you can even directly edit the results directly. the screenshot shows three Quell files to merge:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& diffdiff3; helps you with the comparisons and merging complete folder. this screen photo shows & diffdiff3; in folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& diffdiff3; shows the exact differences and operate the options of today's color monitors. if you have to check code frequently, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabulators are shown clearly. if lines only differ in certain number of white characters, you can see the summary at a summary in the column at the left side. (no trouble longer if any one changes the insertion.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If one file is equal, and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files are the same name but in different folders, then you can make yourself completely exporting the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Diffuse 2 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening dialog allows manual setting of filenames, select the selection above the file browser (file...) or the Select a recently opened file. you don't have to specify a third file. if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences are carried out with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Over the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparisons or merge takes place. if for A file is selected, for B and C, however, a folder, then use & dediff3; the file name from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merge is enabled, the input field is active for target and can be changed. however, it is not necessary to determine immediately an output file. you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set-button opens a dialog with settings. here you can define options before you start with the comparisons / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a file, but only parts of a text compare. & diffdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard to the active comparative window. in the opening process, you don't need to select any files you can simply connect the dialog using the sender button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use Zithroes and Use: simply draw a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which idea is behind it? sometimes it contains a file such as several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would have only two corresponding files, they would be able to copy them into & diffdiff3; you can simply copy and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: at the moment you can't pull out anything & diffdiff3; just the fine text in a comparative window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and insertion of text into another program as outcrop and insert (instead of copying and insert). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text box is the info line. the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) Any Info line has a different color. (if the path is too long, let the mouse lie for a while on the line. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are the letters A, B and C. A has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these settings can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, one sees the color which differs from different files. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files. that's good in the next section (merge) good.</seg>
<seg id="2306">In addition to the text, the check column column. if differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white signs are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, for example, white characters are only available in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few, rare individuals.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which separates the merge column of text, will be interrupted at places where the respective source file is activated. if the line breaks is activated, the line is shown at broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparative Americans) also has a info-line with the inscription:, the file name and [changes] if you have processed the result. usually it contains text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! to all conflicts are dissolved, Save the buttons!!! (use the buttons jump to next soldered / unsolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparators are used, any difference is also to be solved in the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking on the left hand column in one of the window, the group is displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will appear in every window, where the beginning of the group will not be visible.) This group will then highlighted the current group. it will be highlighted with color background colour for current area and on the left side a black bar will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, through the automatic merging or through manual processing, no more line is left in the group; this is only a placeholder for the event that you can change your mind and perhaps again choose another source. this text is not displayed in the final stored file, nor in a marking that you may copy and elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; assembly works; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the results window. go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if you choose the options, the options ignore or Ignore C / C + + comments enabled, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate primarily with the image and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you are in one of the window, you can use the arrow keys to the left, right, end, Strg-beginning and trl end, siw how you can also use it from other programs. the transfer column will also be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye-window you can also use the other buttons to edit. using the insert button, you can switch between insert and overlap mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left-hand mouse button synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective Group (as already stated in the section) and the editable window.</seg>
<seg id="2318">The tool bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / previous difference (Ctrl-picture) to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture) or the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture) or to the next / previous conflict. therefore, there must be a conflict between deleted and unsolved conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the selection in the clipboard, you need to copy the copying -button (Ctrl-C or trl insert). if this option is activated, which will always mark your clipboard automatically and the manual copy fails. be careful, because you could accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeilers are stored according to the underlying operating system. UNIX versions are using a Zeilenfeed sign\, and Win32-based systems use vehicle refeed + Zeilenclosures\\ r\. KDiff3 reserves the source code of the source file, so you should not use & diffdiff3; also not using binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the last used files will be automatically stored and reproduced at the next start. (menu insert - &gt; KDiff3)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a script with a fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides writings with variable width, you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences are displayed in italic font. if the chosen font does not support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered rendered. on these systems, the button automatically displays an odd colour.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is enabled, the preset button is inserted the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise, a tabulator sign will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you push or press Return, the previous line will be automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, any selection automatically is copied into the clipboard. manual copy the clipboard then.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can choose which line-end type you prefer to save. the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">While using files tries & diffdiff3; first, all completely identical lines can be ignored in the source file. only during this first step, white characters are ignored. in this step, white characters are not ignored. even when together, white signs are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a vehicle retrieve '\' at the end of one line, and then you could save only one Zeilenue '\'. usually ignored & diffdiff3; the car race mark, but then you could be treated differently with different sizes. during the merge this option must be disabled. in default, this option is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">Default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') ignored. in the result, the differences are still shown, but they will be treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">Default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive after even smaller differences. the option is activated in default. it is effectively in complicated and large files, but slowly at very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the automation mode, this setting is determined, as long as the result of the selection is indicated before the next unsolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Triggers all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file as a source. if you want this only from time to time, you can better use the functions Chole A / B / C for all unscalable white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments, if the options ignore or Ignore C / C + + comments enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter on the scanning of folders and through a merging of merging. look for details under documentation to the directory and merge connection.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, the original version is the suffix .original box. if already such a backup file with the suffix .original exists, this will be deleted without any further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapting the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the currently ongoing program. you need & kdiff3; end and restart, so that the change is active. (this option is set in the KDE version of & kdiff3; because the language is set on the control centre globally.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if one activated this option, the top setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Via the selection fields for encoding appears a short note, which is the local coding. (this can't be changed here and has a purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this affect how special characters are treated and interpreted. as encoding for each file can be adjusted individually, even files can be compared and combined with different coding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding must be used for storing.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing command, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files can be 16-bit Unicode, but the processing command can only be done with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can define the encoding of the issue of processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Switch this off to suppress highlighting of changes in the text or oversight. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options ignore or Ignore C / C + + comments enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, you may only see the differences between two of three files. after selecting A & lt; -gt; B, A & lt; -gt; C, A & lt; -gt; C is displayed next to normal nor a second transfer column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines. just send the less important window. (this option is located in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arranges the comparison window next to each other or successively. this can also be useful for viewing of long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes consider the differences and then decide if you compare only two files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it will be handed over to this external command. in & diffdiff3; the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own pre-processor, which is exactly your requirements. you can use this function for example to remove disruptive parts or to correct the input.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it is given first to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is given (see above), the output of this command command is used. the output of the command is used only when the line is equal. each input line must have an associated issue line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to enable the user to enable more flexibility when setting the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program yourself. however, the good news is, however, that in most cases linked or perl perfectly sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">In this connection, use this preprocessing command to convert the input to major letters: SED'S /\\ (. *\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) refers to the folded text in the first clamp. the\\ U converts the found text in upper case letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some key words to automatically generated character strings (info: / cvs / keyword\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with drivers, you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may like this regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The Ignoring of numbers is actually a built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of a further processing command for Zeilenabys. sed 's / [0123456789.-] / / g' Every sign between '[' and ']' is a hit, and each hits will be replaced by nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several results at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' use to separate the results from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed, you can also use something different such as perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replacement / switch 'However at perl some details differently. where sed\\ (and\\) requires, perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal Preprocessor are maintained for viewing and merging. the further operations will only change the data, which the line-like algorythmus can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the line-off-processor is the output of the normal preprocessor.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as in any function, the text changes or differences, you may accidentally notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often you need to edit a lot of files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and assemble full file with & dediff3; complete folder.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... for each object a proposal to merge; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can the merge simulate and shows the simulated changes, without it really perform,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... selected actions either with all (F7 key) or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparisons and merging of individual files. you just need to specify files on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three files are collected, folder 1 is used as a base. if no target file is given, use & diffdiff3; folder 3 as a target file.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically, not the merge. to select the merge, you'll need to press the respective menu entry or press the F7 key. (see further details.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder you will inform you a little news window about the current progress. if you cancel the scanning the folder, only the files are listed, which have been compared to then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is complete, shows & diffdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Any file and file that was found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure will normally be displayed usually. you can click on the + / - button, or click on the object double or by clicking on the object) or push the arrow keys to the left / right.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you click on a file, the file comparison will start and it appears a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column Name reflects the file type in the first file (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window of the selected object. in such a case, the assembly-clock action cannot be selected automatically. if the merge is started, you will be informed about problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the above picture, in the columns A / B / C, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used.</seg>
<seg id="2376">Identical entries, the color is identical, even if the age of entries are different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are regarded as identical, if their overall content is identical. then you also have the same color. with folders, the age is unsignificant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. colours reflect the colors of a leaf which is only green, then yellow becomes yellow and later when it is old, red becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical but not B: copying B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical but not a: copy from A (or if a doesn't exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C does not have the same file type (e.g. A folder and B a file): error: contradictory data types. as long as such flawed objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B not have the same file type (e.g. A folder and B a file is): error: contradictory data types. as long as such flawed objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronize is active, if only two folder and no explicit target file is specified, and if the option is synchronize directories. then select & diffdiff3; the necessary action, so afterwards both folders are identical.</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: merging and the result in both folders. (the user looks as the visible file name for the output file only B; right after merging copies & diffdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders will be merged, then select & dediff3; the date of files and proposes the newer file to copy. if the file are different, but the same date appears differently, but the date is identical.. such as such errors are not removed, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the merge, a file is processed after the other. it's status column indicates, and according to other messages when something unexpected can be completed. if the merge is completed, you should take a final review and see if the status is fine.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in alignment dialog, the file comparative method is selected, KDiff3 will display another columns. these contain the number of unloaded, dissolved, not white and white conflicts. (the column for dissolved conflicts is only shown if three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either run the selected entry (file or oraries) or all entries on one. if you have chosen all the merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start together.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have no target file specified, then in the three-file merge mode C is used as the target, the B and / or B is used as a target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you chose a target folder, please check if all entries are displayed in the target folder, even in the folder structure. there are some options to be skipped in folder structure. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To lead all entries: select directory together / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (key shortcut): select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If caused by contradictory data types still invalid merge actions, a message appears on the incorrect elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you complete any entries, a dialogue window will appear with the options, simulate and break.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Choose simulate if you want to see what would happen, without the really changes made. you will then get an exhaustive list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& diffdiff3; then execute specific actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is needed (execute a single file), then a merge window opens (please note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you're done with a file, select another directory together / continue or press F7. if you still haven't saved, a corresponding dialog appears. then, & dediff3; his work continues with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & diffdiff3; on an error, a message and detailed status information appears. at the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you to select the problem of the problem. if you have the option to select another action for the entry or to solve the problem in any way before you proceed with the merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">In case some entries were individually collected, you can notice & dediff3; this entries (in the current session) and leads them not again later, these entries are taken as a matter. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Settings - &gt; KDiff3 setup...) now has a section called directory merging with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern will be shown in the elementary tree. separate patterns with a semicolon;. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not correspond to this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not shown in the elementary tree. it can be given more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not shown in the elementary tree. it can be given more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignore files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatisch produced files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this file is specific with a .cvsignals file. (see under info: / cvs / cvsignals.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems files have a checked attribute. in other file systems there is a default point. this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the Elementum or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">In links to files: if the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is switched on, the files are compared to which the links show. this is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">In case of links on folder: if the option is switched off, the links like normal stewards are treated and recursively searched. (note that & diffdiff3; do not apply to a folder of a link to himself and & diffdiff3; crashes off.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Leads a complete analysis of each file by and displays statistics columns. (the number of soldered, unpowder, non- white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when it is applied to files that do not contain any text. (specify an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large files via a slow network, it may be easier to compare only the date of date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security. please use caution. this option is stored in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to confidentiality date of date. there is no real comparison instead. these files are regarded as identical, if they are equal to any size. that can be useful for example when copying the date of date. please use caution. this option is stored in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activating the synchronize mode, if two files are compared and no target file specified. in this mode, the proposals for merging files are identical to both folders. also, the results of merge files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merge the copy of the newer file is proposed as action. (this is assumed as uncertain, because it is assumed that the other file has not been changed.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder will be replaced or deleted, the original version is renamed and receives the extension .orig. if an old backup file is deleted with the .original extension already, this also affects the normal merging of single files, not only the merge whole file. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the file merge display remains visible, you can shift the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want to change the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want, you can switch the window directory & text window to switch between the windows and text windows between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file via double-click. however, there is also a corresponding menu entry. you can also use a single file directly, without only the folder will run. once you store the result, the status will be reset, and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost, however, when you read the directory again: directory menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of Kio Slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way you can specify files and folders to open on local or remote computer.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local file.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. a few things you should note:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively. or.. s. that's not possible with URLs, these are always absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters have to be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, blank &gt;% 20, etc.), for example, has a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. it follows a brief list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished if a link shows a file or file. then it will always be accepted as a link target. (FTP:, SFTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change of change. therefore, permissions, or change of change from the original. (please note the option of confidentiality).) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently as a difference in KDevelop. KDevelop first starts to start the built-in differences. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button over the differences and then select In KDiff3Part show from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally needed & diffdiff3; two complete input files. if it is applied as a part, & dediff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then start & dediff3; the patch program to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu in - KDiff3Part. please note that if not the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since generation of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & diffdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports the comparisons of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. the merge or comparing of folders is not supported in part mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now hot it is Compare). in addition, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs already very long and have learned a lot in the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this path or go so.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You probably compiled the program from the sources and configure the configure script by the correct PREFIX. in the default configure / usr / local, but then KDE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are first treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line is not identical as yet. iF similar lines. next to Each other, this tribis, but this bis often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor is noticeable for any difference in the files where it begins and where it ends. however, this important information is lost, however, if the result is simply stored as text file, and it's too much effort to design extra a private file format which could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this was so far too big. you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text should be another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; no src lints; and the text does not delete. what does that mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& diffdiff3; uses many colors to emphasize from differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and lacks the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all the features of & kdiff3; you need & KDE; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">For information, as you can use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE you can find on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of the latest changes will be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or in the file Changelog in the Quel package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile & install diffdiff3; on a system with & KDE; to compile and install, use the following command in the basic set of & dediff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir gives the folder in your system installed in which KDE is installed. if you are uncertain, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automake used, you should have no problems with compiling. if you still have difficulty, please report on the & KDE; mailing lists thereof.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or orbit) copy into the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or orbit-insert) add the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position or replaces the current mark.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences are: files are identical in all folders that are not in folder structure, and therefore do not appear in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you have to read the folder with the function Refresh) to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">Only entries are displayed, the differences are indicated. in case the target file does not already contain in the target file. if the target file does not already contain these files, they are missing according to merge. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is switched off in the default program.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to choose from the source with the labelling A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines are attached to the end of the selected group in the results window (if they are already present), if the lines are already present, they will be removed when clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Default, this option is deactivated. the differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a miniature preview of all virtual working surfaces. it is quite convenient to change the ongoing programmes on the workspaces, to change their size, to end or move it. this works both within a desktop and also several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can show all virtual workspaces as well as the applications. applications can be selected and even be moved on desktop and other applications.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the medium mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible within a desktop, as well as other spaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager; however, the context menu has only been set up on the empty background... and end. if, however, the context menu and the name of the application, as well as the entries minimize, maximize, at desktop and end.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window on the full size of desktop. appears only if it was clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to selected virtual desktop. only appears when it was clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this cross field is marked, windows can be moved within & Kpager; s with the medium mouse button on the desktop and also to other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, in & Kpager, the names of virtual working surfaces are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross the field allows the & Kpager; displaying the numbers of virtual working surfaces. it is provided together with name, the names are provided with ordinance numbers, & eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is crossed, the background of each desktop is also shown as a background in & Kpager; displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is crossed, the ongoing programmes are displayed as small windows in & Kpager; otherwise, only the empty workspaces are shown to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here is the view of the programming window. simple, simple rectangles with the proportions of the programming window. symbol shows the window with their standard symbol and pixels. note: pixel resolution is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; -main fliners can appear: classic leaves & Kpager; in some other window managers appear; horizontally, all virtual working areas in a horizontal and vertically show in a vertical line, which is very good for the display at the side of mind.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager miniature program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display window as symbols or with their content and move away. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the mouse button to set up in & Kpager; and set out the switch from the switch... allows you to display the dialog settings.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment, this can not be changed in the dialog settings: but you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you don't have to contact the file server or turn to your system administrator. in this file, you must enter the key windowTransparent mode and refer to that value. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click, as soon as the mouse indicator gets a while on the same place. it is thought to help people who emulate the repetitive strain inhibiting (RSI) syndrome, and which every mouse click pains. furthermore, it can emulate the pulling with the mouse. however, this requires a little exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle pain when using the mouse button and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you can cause pain that are related to your computer's use, if you are looking for a doctor if this is not done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To clarify it again: even if & kmousetool will avoid pain that arise when clicking with the mouse, it is against pain that are caused by the beam because of the mouse, and as with all ergonomic auxiliary agents: the result can vary for each differently.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and execute a mouse click, once you interrupt the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the intelligent relocating is enabled, & kmousetool; a break after the push of the mouse button is emulated. you can now move the mouse button before leaving the mouse button. this way you can remove the bridging with pressed moustaste. the intelligent deleting requires a little exercise, but you get used to get used quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This soft time must be completed following the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool; a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intellignes is switched on, the shooting time (1 / 10 s) is active. here the time is set, the & kmousetool will be waiting for the mouse button before adding the mouse button, if there is no mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now, this function is enabled by clicking on the right and back, followed by a break, a click with the right mouse button. this movements are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt which will start the first time, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound appears delayed, you can reduce the response time. open the & kcontrolcenter; go to sound & multimedia, choose there sound system and here the rider General. there is a slipper sound buffer you can set up at a lower value to reduce the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is marked, & kmousetool; started at each start of & KDE; this function is currently only under & KDE; available at GNOME or other window environments, please check out the respective documentation to find out how you automatically start a program.</seg>

<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with default settings. especially the intelligent shift should be switched off first. if you get used to the automatic mouse click here, you can later move the smart shifting.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you are using the audible click, it is necessary to decrease the response times of & KDE; to decrease sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of what places a mouse click without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window, which do not have a link, does not lead to unwanted reactions. therefore, you can park the mouse at such places, until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to pull out the mouse ball. as it happens, it is different from mouse to mouse. however, it should be clear if you view the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. dirt and dirt can be scratched easily with a flat blade or finger nails.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system cancels the execution of & kmousetool; if you use the intelligent shift in this case, that means & kmousetool, the operation can no longer be replaced by letting the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use under a different window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click. herein, the status of & kmousetool will be reset; and you can work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another spot.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to place where you want it. but you do not want to make use of mouse click on a neutral area of desktop if you don't want to create any extra mouse clicks. secure zones for the mouse pointers are & eg; the grey areas around the toolbars and menus and the title lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent shift, but I don't make it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent shift is a advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is highly possible to mark it into the clipboard or to add it into the clipboard, but it will probably only cause problems. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the intelligent shift, if you just start to start & kmousetool; Please select text instead: run a mouse click on the end of the text area and hold the switch button, while you move the mouse pointing to the other end of the text and again the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouseclick. this will happen every time when & kmousetool; the mouse button is playing a sound like a mouse click. later you can use the intelligent shift to use without the audible mouseclick. however, it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; use the XTest extension for & X Window; installed. that should be the case most of the system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is available only if the system has a sound card and loudspeaker and are set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; actuated the mouse button as soon as the mouse indicator has waited for short. this program has been developed for people who suffer from the RSI syndrome, and those that begged the bridle pain.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced skills of & ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filter is not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filtering the text is processed, before it will be sent to the program speech dispatcher. you are useful to replace the pronunciation to select false language and narrations, or to avoid certain shortcomings of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the mode of filters, it is important to know how the program "speech dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The Edition of Screen-Readern has the highest priority. it will be pre-read to all other contracts. if the edition of the Screen-Reader is read, the orders received will be continued again.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this stage is important news as & eg; processor will be too hot. a warning has priority and holds the output of news and normal text. these orders will be resumed after the issue of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of a application that is used for messages. while you & eg; a long text on a website, you can enter the room with & kmouth. & KDE; -notifications are also news. read it.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text contracts. each order you meet from the card ticket orders, is a word order. KSayit is an example of applications that have been used text applications. text yields are intended for issue longer texts, which have no particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four orders will be processed in queues, except for the output of Screen-Readers. if an application sends the output of an Screen-Readers, while & ktts are reading, this issue will be stopped and finished.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen-Readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text messages as well as on & KDE; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters process the text and pass it to the next filters. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there can be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Character processors can replace parts of a text by other text. it can be delivered either as words or regular expressions. & ktts; used by text or regular expressions like: -) by text or for the formatting of messages from & counter; or & mail; in better understandable form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; resducers use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; in delivery of & ktts; some XSLT files are included in the translation of & XHTML; in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">You can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program, which sent the text to & ktts; sent to a speaker. if you have sent a female voice on the card card, you can read text from KDE messages to read about.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules, according to which it is applied for a speech output. if the filter is fixed, his rules does not apply, he will remain the text unchanged at the next filters.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a word order, a message, warning or any & KDE; -Notification of & ktts; sent them by all activated filters, which were set up on the page below. processing through the filter is done in the list of the list below.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of standard normal filters. if a filter is not crossed, it is not activated and is not used. filter will be turned from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of felt, and it will be shown below the following setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison list. these patterns are found in text, then the text will be exchanged in text against the corresponding replacement text. large and small friction is not considered by comparison.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Specify a name for your filters. you can choose any name, it must only differ from the names of the other filters.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; which allows the management of network interfaces, the routine and the DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a series of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package has been developed to enable the users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; the areas of & networkconf; create a simple surface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings are displayed in the & kcontrolcenter; the module network settings (networkconf;) can be launched by selecting ccontrolcentre; Internet & network network settings in & menu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & networkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their driver must already be operational and configured, thus & networkconf; the device is displayed at all and allows the setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed on the Installing of & Linux; installed and furnished. network devices later added, the drivers need to be loaded by adapting the following files, according to the kernel version, are loaded:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The module network settings will be loaded when the network settings will be selected in the & kcontrolcenter; -Index. when starting the module network, this software automatically tries to detect the used platform on the system automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform can't be recognized, the variety is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and the Releasestand is the best. by marking the setup no-again questions can be hit permanently. at the next start of the network settings, this selection will be automatically preset.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is possible only in system management mode. previously, all options are displayed grey, which means settings can only be considered. in system management mode, you can access the button management mode at the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">The overall functionality of the module is available in system management mode. this is divided into three horsemen:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab network interfaces for administration of the system networks. all available network equipment will be displayed. from the tab network interfaces, the following tasks can be carried out:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The default network interfaces can set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the buttons interface... set up in the dialog device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. clicking on the set-up settings shows the dialogue with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The TCP / IP settings are collected by a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, TCP / IP information is provided with the start of system services. there is no further adjustment required. in the list box, there can be either DHCP or BOOTP, according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">You can set the TCP / IP configuration without DHCP or BOOTP. in an input field IP address, the required TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field, the netmask is fixed.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is marked, the system initialize the network interface for boats. if the initialization is not requested, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values in this dialogue are displayed as features of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. if you have already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP address. with ping in the & console, you can determine whether the required address is already in use. in doubt the network administrator should be asked.</seg>

<seg id="2818">The computer address of the host is fixed in the local subnet which mediates the physical connection to remote networks and is provided by default to TCP / IP communication with machines in other subnetworks.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If the computer is more than a network interface, the interface must be selected to the network where the Gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name through the respective IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the computer is required to http: / / www.einedomain.org, the DNS cates this name into an IP address such as 123,43,678,90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The calculator on the name solution part of the horse's name solution enables simple administration of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed pre.DNS entries can be arranged by selecting a paper or executing in the list with the buttons or herunder in the priority.</seg>

<seg id="2824">From the group computer to name resolution, select one entry and then click on the button Edit.... It is displayed in the dialog Edit.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of well-known hosts describes the user name-to-IP address references to TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used when there are no DNS servers. in small, enclosed networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally the list of well known hosts contains some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. these still existing version of IP should still be replaced in the future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the well-known computer and click Add... The dialog New alias is being displayed.</seg>

<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is enough if & KDE; and Qt installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the completed version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install in one & counter; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool with graphic surface such as kpackage or the installation tool of their distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case the installation of Qt and & KDE; not only, but additionally the development packages with libraries and other things are needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & networkconf; you should compile these commands.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about fundamental network technology are given, in the second all of & networkconf; alterable configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can't replace further knowledge on IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information is mediated on the integration of PCs into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks operate with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found large spread. IPv6 is expected to see in the near future. this description focuses on widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge which IP address is allocated to a network interface. in foreign networks, am & eg; workplace is the response agency that can be used a valid IP address or if available, can be DHCP. definitely the IP address can't be chosen freely!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a own small (home) Network work, the IP address is chosen from a specially reserved area for this purpose to avoid IP address accounts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, so its use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateway.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, you usually use addresses in the range of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the range is large for networks up to 250 machines.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set on 255.255.255.0 so that all the hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = its own host). the standard route is required for the IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this section, the configuration files, which are affected by & networkconf; and where they are stored in the different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes altered in DSL connections, so it is not surprising when in case of active DSL connections to find another content than defined there.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a fuse program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the ability to create multiple archives on a tape. the first target was to create a surface for tar, which presented the ability of dds2tar to fast, selective unpacking. the second goal was to answer a question that my wife: how much longer takes it when you feel?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be bound by & kdat; this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; spin the band back and read the pretensioning information of the tape. recognizes & kdat; the band on the band will not be asked if the band is formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognise & kdat; the prefix, search it according to the appropriate index on your disk. can't be found, you will be asked whether the band-index is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol changed for the tape drive to indicate that the band is included. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the content of the tape can now be searched for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before throwing the tape, first the integration must be solved. there are three methods to evaluate this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; indicates a modification of the symbol for the band that the integration of the band was solved and shows a corresponding message in the Status Bar. the band can now be cast out without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & kdat it can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band species have to formatted before saving data can be used. this process does not conform to the formatting at & kdat; this process does not have to be formatted before it can be formatted before using the band of & kdat. floppy drives are usually formatted by the tape of the band, DAT drives by contrast.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity goes & kdat; with the formatting of the band. all data on the tape are lost! after completion of the formatting process, the band will be automatically bound and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before using the backup process, you must select the safest files. this can be done on three types:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select one file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or file is secured.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a fassment profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are secured.</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to recreate the tape indexfile using the bandin content. this process will delete all existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two types of the volume:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This will create a fassment profile with the straight selected files and default settings. you can prefix the following settings for a fuse profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current work folder in which the fuse is to be done. the list of notifyory files is automatically updated accordingly to the selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are listed under backup files, that only the files are stored on the same file system, like the folder. folders that are on other file systems can be installed separately under the file system. each entry is viewed from tar regardless of the other file system files.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files are secured, which have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file, which is used to determine changes since last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file from the tar. this causes all files to be secured and create a new snapshot file for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; lt; LT; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings you can set up using the menu option KDat... in the Settings menu. the following settings can be presented:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / Tape). this path must refer to non-rewinding version of the band device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & codat; before the tape is attached, the command is loaded to the drive. if some drives is necessary, it may be performed before reading or write operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched on, track & dat to lock the ejection mode. possibly, this attitude does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, the bandaging is switched off by & kdat; automatically disconnect the tape. do not use this option at floppy streamer.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched on, try & kdat; the hardwartime block size for the tape drive. doesn't matter whether this setting is active or not, you must notify & kdat; in any case the block size for your band drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a band formatted, it is writing a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only prove a memory block on the tape. the content of the file describes as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is the host name: seconds, where the host name is the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have been formatted since the epoch.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file named in the $HOME / .kdat file in the same name.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the band are pure tar - archives that can manage directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it does not act in incremental fuses.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup band. this symbol is only active when a band is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & KDE; -viewer for system protocols. the program is appropriate for unexperienced users, where you can get information about your system or where the system allows you to get information about your system, experienced users for quick access, for example, on problems related to their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background. the program is appropriate for unexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system is deposited the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users the quick access to information about problems that can appear on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore, try to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and evaluated by certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, & ksystemlog; a number of useful features include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included, and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screen photo, & ksystemlog; functions available, with the help of the individual protocol lines of a protocol-file easily filtering and sort. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start tries & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol doesn't show you, and it opens up with system administrators. the protocol files are usually not listed under Linux in the file / var / log, for normal users usually don't have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter out after a selected criterion or according to the selected filters. in the default setting, the selection box is displayed next to the selected filters. then a protocol-line will only display, if included in one of the columns's string search engine is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another record at this point. the string search engine will then select the column process, and in addition, in the protocol mode, select the column process, and carry out this in the filter bar named a process, so show you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines have been sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in default settings and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a striking color as the protocol-lines of the stage indication. the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only certain processes (for example, in the system protocol or in cron protocol), you can then find the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example, if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the launch of Samba server. in this case, use the filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can turn the option to new lines jump in the context menu of the main file system to display all new added protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; enables you to use multiple protocol files into separate subtypes. to open this feature, use the entries in the menu to open up additional windows and to manage. once you have selected a window, select a Protocol for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.or.Dort you will find further current information on the catchment of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you will also find in the following folders of the & KDE; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & KDE; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & KDE; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init system evolves quickly for the control of the program starts at the high drive of the system in & Linux; because it is easier to use, more powerful, and more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further on historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to set up a machine on System V Init without any reinstallation and re-format. that's why you need to be sure that the old Init was removed from there, if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init also differs from BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for every system service which you would like to run at the high drive of the system or change on any other run-level. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; System services, not such as setserial, which is only started once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be on one hand under / etc / rc.d, if you need it. most systems possess this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also want to run a rc.conf / etc / rc.d if you want to run something with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for in different places after the program init and starts the first he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line as the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can throw a glance into the second column and probably determine that the default is run-level 3. if you want to change it, then you can change / etc / inittab by hand and the 3 change. if you do something through it, then you can repair it by restart the system and run the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start to start the right scripts? if you enter -l enter into rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that no real files are in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How starts and stop init actually system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is written thus that there is an argument such as start and stop. you can actually start this script by hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would read the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it includes a K, the script will stop with the argument stop. if it includes a S, the script will start with the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people desire a simple way to establish machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server-level, which can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc. furthermore, I could also have a user -Runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or other hand-device is easy to not say trivial: just draw an entry from the range of the available system services on one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop to stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also change scripts between Runleveling or change the position within one level by removing it somewhere else. however, the entry of its original Rune level (or its position) is removed. this only happens if they withdraw an entry from the range of the Available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are postponed if you select this into a new area. to copy only to a new Runlevel, you need to choose from the menu Edit or select from the context menu, and even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Sometimes the sort of details can not be calculated sometimes. in such a case you must edit the numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to add system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there are currently no possibility to restore entries that were thrown into the trash bin. be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab button to activate the various working ranges (Available System Services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) and the cursor keys to meet a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another Runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To manually change the registration number or the name of a entry, press the tab button to switch between different fields. connect the button by typing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc), if they are available. otherwise, changes are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runleveling and now starts the machine permanently. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO-Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single-user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I provided some system services with & ksysv; designed to run under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way, how system services are started in these distributions, is simplified the configuration for proprietary intervention programs of these distributions, but unfortunately is not standard. the authors of & ksysv are planning an expansion of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">In case you are using any other distribution: please check if all configuration files are available, which are required by their respective system service (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) just cancel without news if their configuration files are not present or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you are using any other distribution, please send us more information about Runlevel, so that this manual may be added.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program, you can manage users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaption of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you need to save this. either you use the corresponding symbol of toolbar or record save in the menu file.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two card cards, the user and the users list. select the desired user or the desired batch with a double-click on the entry. it appears the dialog user and group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some card cards are displayed only if you have activated advanced system settings. only if you can create space constraints (Quota) for users, you will be able to register individual settings, if you can install individual settings, if shadow passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd like in BSD uniboxes are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password management card appears if shadow passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd, like in BSD, can be installed.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card is activated only if for at least a single file system limitation (Quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable at the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here, there can be changed for any user parameter, where the limits are available in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected using the field file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card groups informs about the group of selected users. the default group, to which the user is heard, you will find in the Primary Group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by signing this in the big field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, mark this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or a group, select "User or Group" or click the matching Add button of toolbars. editing or delete the selected user or the selected group is analogous.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO-boot manager, remove the boot loader, remove and change the time up to the standard operating system, remove the default operating system, remove, change, change, and more.</seg>
