although I visited the USA at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordin@@ arily great .
as many of my generation I grew up with American films , American authors have read and operated by American authors .
in fact , this country had a profound profound effect on me that I was mainly found because of an American film journalist .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less reporter , who covered himself with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura @-@ Stu@@ ff , who wanted to occupy the Supreme Court with judges who wanted to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free according to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was , as if it &apos;s the absolute truth , forget everything I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year that I was living in Arizona , my admi@@ ration had only intensi@@ fied for the US .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting you can always be who you are and it &apos;s easy acceptance in a community of equal people .
I had even written a very painful love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his asc@@ ending is for me , as he goes with his narrow @-@ minded people .
he never stops behind the mountain , as you say so beautiful .
he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague , and openly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ American and Women .
nevertheless , people responded to his testimony and voted in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes , whom he won at the Republican elections , was the highest number one reached by the party nominated candidate ever .
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ otte person , I asked myself ?
I could not bring tr@@ ump and his voters to the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
for example , like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the Journ@@ alism programme , people from around the world , a deeply believing man , with whom I could enter@@ tain myself about Islam and its past .
also , Tr@@ um@@ ps is not backed by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to see the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; when watching .
Tr@@ um@@ ps intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity which I experienced in Sandy B@@ ahr , who fights for their lives in the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family that treated me like her son .
it still fits to the dedication of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es that always helped me with much patience and grace to me and my colleagues , to acc@@ ust@@ om us to the complexity of the American life .
then there were Andrew le@@ ak@@ ey , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er council helped me a lot in my career .
these people and those are em@@ bodied by them by em@@ bodied my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump found his way to nom@@ inate republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidates , they gave me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
it turned out , however , that they were the exception of rule .
on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of its contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the discussion with the idea that people voted for tr@@ ump , because they either shared his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ smus , or because they were willing to over@@ see these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is un@@ fair to describe the tr@@ ump @-@ elec@@ tors as ra@@ mp@@ sts .
to arrange the people , one of my friends , is exactly what led us to that situation .
this is superf@@ icial and resp@@ ect@@ ful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows people that their wor@@ ries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities cannot be taken into account .
could it be that these voters , of whom most are white , voted for dr@@ ump because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country , which she has disappointed ?
in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contemp@@ t on those who look differently than he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( O@@ B . ) : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rebellion of the white against all other eth@@ n@@ ici@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; word game from white in response to the White and Whi@@ pl@@ ash , as did the big Van Jones &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; exactly what America has made so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you may always have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country elected as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history he says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the choice of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of the White America &apos;s promise and says : hell with vers@@ atility , religious freedom and the concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the Ru@@ der , they say .
with all this , I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier , who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration of Hillary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have been my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your United States ? &quot; Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your United States ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they called them and their voices were lou@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and lou@@ dly &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
Mr. Khan ended with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t that of America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country , for whom his son was like , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , said the message .
and all the people like Mr. Khan , could not find no place in this new America .
and that breaks me my heart .

from mis@@ ery to the stars : these Latin American children don &apos;t leave their love for music by garbage .
the &quot; Recy@@ cled Instruments Orchestra &quot; from Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what is the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero municipality in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city Cat@@ e@@ ura together ?
the music that is played in both places , not only the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , just 16 kilometres south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an ancient colonial city that is very popular among tourists , but worlds apart from nearby prehistoric ruins and of its world famous cuisine .
for several years , La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) has been playing in the community : one of children and adults existing sym@@ ph@@ ony orchestra , which has found an opportunity for over@@ coming the surrounding poverty .
a school of school with 100 students became the central interest in the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and bands .
but this changed after a coinci@@ dental encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth had a rare hope of hope .
the young band members take their comm@@ itments to the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI writes :
once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laughing and with shining eyes and play in the gu@@ bel you meet day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , Pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ ke , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga .
music from garbage
more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village that is practically on the biggest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in the capital of the capital - on instruments which are made of restored waste material :
music with restored instruments , made up of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycling of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez has started to turn parts of the waste in instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viola , C@@ elli , contra@@ b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion that were all made out of the garbage .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an , Latin American music and music by the Beatles , from Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o Chávez reminds of a local ec@@ ologist and musician teachers of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , at the initial time :
first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach in the same place , the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents , because many of them do not live together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was a bit shown , which he had never seen before : a violin produced by a waste .
today , there is a complete orchestra which plays on instruments from restored material and called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentary called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) shows the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world produces about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
those who live with him and live by him are the poorest - like men in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they transform it into something beautiful .
landing Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspiring spectacle of garbage @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra played music even before Pope Francis :
these Eastern African countries show how technology and team@@ work can fight illegal fishing companies
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing is fought .
this post , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems .
the release happens in an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to joint use of contents .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Li@@ berian waters before the other coast of Africa was seeking .
the East African countries were correspon@@ dent over accordingly , and little incl@@ ined to welcome the criminals of this kind in their co@@ asts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the com@@ rades , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobile mobil@@ ised rapidly against the ship . they refused to share one of their ports and refused to share a fishing permits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries , which all of you refused , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing industry . he is part of a team that discovered the ship of his time and followed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , due to pill@@ aging the country &apos;s stocks .
the core of this initiative , which protects criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO stop illegal fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing stop ) .
alongside Somalia and Madagascar , members of this network are six countries , which then drove the prime minister out of their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are con@@ sp@@ inn@@ ed and working together . they exchange information and stand each other with illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding illegal fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is caught , is hidden , essential because it is extremely difficult to find out . thereby , illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing in regions .
due to the deliber@@ ate ab@@ regard of existing laws , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems may harm the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but during actions against illegal fishing once caused by bureaucra@@ tic hur@@ d@@ les , and also through the worm @-@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , these actions happen today in real time , with trace@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange licenses , learn news on susp@@ icious activities or details , which you noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive , when they move on the open sea , using satellite data .
this enables the authorities to character@@ ize ships which fish in the banned areas - such as susp@@ ects that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such examinations may show whether the involved ships have a fishing licence , where they were on the road and possibly , whether they have a criminal justice .
countries that are against illegal fishing , can use the assumption of such ships in their ports . what does that the ships can &apos;t sell their cargo . and that they could even be forced to commit to the numbers of pun@@ ishments , as in the case of Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about significant financial losses for the owners , which means illegal fishing is financi@@ ally worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Senior Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant responsible for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform has been created to gain an estimated $ 20 million of lost turnover , which will lose eight members of the H@@ ISH network each year due to illegal fishermen that penet@@ rate East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies , such as the region of commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also illegal fishermen .
these practices include activities such as sailing under false flag , fake license documents , speci@@ fying of imag@@ ery seeds , fishing protected species and fishing in protected areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they use targeted international cooperation and make the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ consuming control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ship was illegal and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must@@ n &apos;t run my harbor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . and just this leg@@ ale lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now .
so far the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH has been involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ icious ships .
it has exposed criminal networks , which had distributed counterfeit lic@@ ences in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and has found wing@@ ed ships and found .
because of its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for com@@ b@@ ating crimes , F@@ ISH can share information on illegal fishing over large distances .
&quot; some of our investigations show us quite wide in the networks of organised crime , &quot; Ber@@ gh says .
he builds a system that should help F@@ ISH , susp@@ icious ships more precise .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system that is always developed , also helps to track the illegal ships to hide themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Duncan Cop@@ eland , leader analyst at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at tracking , an NGO , which also deals with fish@@ eries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer run out of satellites .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system which connects different information levels . it should help F@@ ISH help finding criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence global problems of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened together with Google and the Oce@@ ans Oce@@ ana platform : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed globally through the position of any trace@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the neighbors , to get a better picture of it , who does what is doing - this simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bund@@ le their resources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should do this on a global level . &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run with which a global system permits the persecution of ships .
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only criminals but it is f@@ loc@@ u@@ sts .
ships that were previously used without a license and hardly have any consequences too , know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i participated in a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries , since fishing boats increased more lic@@ ences .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia helped , Gre@@ ko 1 found out , the inspec@@ tors have been on board tow@@ ing , their use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
other countries observe these successes . &quot; the effect is so strong that we now have other countries , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; we are a study project . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars will disappear annually through illegal fishing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , six countries have joined the West Africa Task Force for the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim is to fight illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security is the goal to create more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member of Somalia was in its first big triumph : in October , it was named Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship travelling under false flag . and not only the ship was on the way without a license and were used to@@ w @-@ nets that are now banned .
the ship was still located in forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the take of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they act against illegal fishing , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
for F@@ ISH , this is another success of many . and at the same time , evidence that such a special , collabor@@ ative work of work in the oceans actually works throughout the world .

they are considered a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the minister of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela has rejected the request of the opposition to a European referendum , the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes were the negotiations about the political and economic crisis of the country to emp@@ t@@ ying on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the return of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures from these demonstrations as well as arguments and against them .
the debate will also be guided in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ lands Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central @-@ north of the federal state Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Isla Margar@@ ita in the federal state Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country deterior@@ ates continuously , which makes it noticeable in everyday life of the Vene@@ tians through a acute short@@ age of food and drugs .
many representatives of the Opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the minister of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro . ultimately , however , the holding of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne Dí@@ az , Con@@ tribut@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in her latest article the context of government reports :
in the context of social , political and economic crisis , the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine was considered to be the only way to conquer its institutional structures and close a new governance .

the call was commented on Twitter as follows :

the first demonstration in the framework of the Action Program &quot; The Return of Venezuela &quot; was held on Wednesday , 26 October .
the images of Mär@@ schen , which are published in real time , testify among other things an overwhelming participation in people in numerous areas of the country , but also conflicts with polic@@ emen as well as advoc@@ ates of the government .
one of the most frequently shared images shows a prot@@ esters that calls on the guards : &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot;

especially big waves beat the message about the poli@@ tic supp@@ ression in the central @-@ north @-@ located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators moved back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later , they could leave the cathedral back safely , but the protests went on .
in other parts of the country some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police workers , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not wear a skir@@ t because you could see something that could not have many nation@@ alities .
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic , which forms the extent of supp@@ ression per day :

many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a minister in question - this has now been demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of many people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ d@@ ado argue that 1 % of the signatures are fake .
here is your minister @-@ up !
on the road !
other values have taken this protests as a further step in the fight against a government that , from their point of view little against the disast@@ rous economic crisis , and rather busy preparing critical voices :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches always take more to frequency and intensity .
some Vene@@ tians reported the media , they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or go shopping .

this is an adap@@ tive version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , a Argentine news page .
the interview was translated into English and published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced out of his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentine town of Córdoba .
meanwhile , in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera Process in Córdoba , led to his father , in the context of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera Process .
in the trial which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined which were committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano isn &apos;t looking for his life .
starting with the br@@ ushes , the same name as his father will carry up to the brutal military operations in the La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he retained the family sec@@ rec@@ y for himself .
in the situation at that time , I believed that was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years , you do not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
I could not know that my father was a thief , t@@ ort@@ ur@@ ers and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ ming officials . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , his father was Deputy Commander of the intelligence department 141 in prison La Per@@ la .

this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ press@@ ors who was indicted for ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 year child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ x@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced the extent of atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows which great power has a parent about his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went with us into the sports hall . there I was delighted with a boy who made mar@@ tial arts .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and called me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are a as@@ sh@@ ole , you have created yourself with one of the ERP .
just listen , that they will not escape a day , and I must save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation of ERP stands for Ej@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the Military arm of the Revolutionary Workers Party of Argentina .
so he charged me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me , I would be a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it would be al@@ right . because so my father loved me .
on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : University statements , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , propaganda materials , books , simply everything .

&quot; there the prisoners are tortured &quot;
my father took me four times a total of La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
during the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time he ordered me to get out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - all possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a little bit wrapped in a blanket , and ordered me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw it was a large c@@ lot of silver .
on this day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen objects were removed and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
I laugh@@ ed in and saw a song , tortured on humans .
it looked like a field @-@ bed and metal @-@ feathers .
later I found out that it was attached to the end of a Cab@@ al . the other end was attached to the body of the person who had just been there .
they cap@@ tiv@@ ated a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , poured him with water and pursued a load of 220 volts to the gen@@ itali@@ a .

the st@@ ank there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty win@@ der .
years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell of his room came .
I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I never forgot this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible for someone else to do so much suffering ?
&apos;@@ i know that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - to the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and they carried to the eye .
he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , a civilian which was also charged in the process ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a series of matt@@ resses , on which naked people were on the face down - all were folded at hands and feet .
near the entrance , people stood still on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you look so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; why did you answer me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit , killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that , because my father told them home .
besides La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms , which were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero destroyed a man and killed it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to data from survivors , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera Process , was sentenced to death to students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) .
in the following video , Emilio Fes@@ sia , the leader of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the path that you came in here is also the way to which the escape came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were allocated as part of the process of de@@ priv@@ ation a number .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order came from above that they should be moved .
this was the lie - Euph@@ em@@ ism - for shooting of people and disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; mur@@ als &apos;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things home .
at that time in the age I had no idea what the &quot; war &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was later on the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - was clear to me that war yield are a B@@ aj@@ on@@ ett or perhaps military sign that you turn out to an enemy .

but when you go into a house and the fridge , turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... sti@@ ste@@ als , then that no war yield but v@@ and@@ alism .
that is theft .
I always wondered how my father , the leader of security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was an officer at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything therein .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Are you looking for cars on the streets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are no criminals ?
he explo@@ ded rage , stroke me , and cried :
if you go so far , then I will find you and re@@ plen@@ ish you .
we don &apos;t need anyone else !
so my father was .
I have no good memory to him .
when I said in the trial , I showed a photo of that , on which I wore a jacket and a roll pul@@ lover of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home .
at that time , the Defence accused me of being a co @-@ prescription for this crime . I answered , no problem , they can lay my burden for me what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to find out .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the body is the last det@@ ect@@ ful act &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel rep@@ ented .
I have children . if one has children only once , one recogni@@ zes the value of a life .
you continue to evol@@ ve and realize that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , so you were ex@@ iled during the dictatorship of man , but what will the bodies disappear ?
why do children kidn@@ ap ?
one day , my father brought a girl with home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I always stood the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
they could have been put in prison just .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but what did your bodies disappear ?
were these people not families , whose remains were passed to their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last det@@ ect@@ ful act , which one can do a man .
my father told me when democracy was re @-@ introduced , they sent machines to eliminate the remains of the prisoners .
they were crushed and disp@@ osed somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; said my father .
but anything remains always .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the thought to indicate my father , was created during a conversation , when he was placed under house arrest .
I made his accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ geni@@ ous and asked me what the entire patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly def@@ ected , were actually good .
then I cried :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed atro@@ cious crimes , and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well then for@@ gave me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I reported the first display .
I was finally recognized that he was a criminal .
nobody can submit to me that I am vo@@ icing . I finally told against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest standing before the end of the trial .
he was indicted for 4@@ 16 crimes : serious , un@@ lawful liberty of freedom in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 special cases , torture with followed death sequence in five cases and a case of ab@@ duction of a less than 10 year @-@ old child .

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the mag@@ nit@@ ude of judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial concluded between March 1975 and December 1978 committed crimes against 7@@ 16 victims .
43 subjects were found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to 28 cases of life imprisonment and nine cases prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ ens .
eleven of the original 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ judgment : murder , torture and rape by officers . #
all def@@ endants were members of the military , including former military personnel , former police departments , and civil employees .
Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i , together with his pregnant woman , was kidnapped in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the Swiss Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by human heads .
the tribunal part is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations that have been working on justice for years .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , a lawyer of the 1995 Argent@@ inian organization , H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , representing the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the research lasted for 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ in@@ ean government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located to be erected a memorial there , which is now being conducted by human rights organisations .

a translation error makes elderly people in Kyoto to &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot;
the sign with the translation errors to a centre in Kyoto , where you can pro@@ long his driving licence .
the photograph was spread in social media .
processing of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his driving licence in the last month , witnesses of a very particularly mis@@ used translation .
in a shield , the Japanese word ( ko@@ rei@@ fen@@ sh@@ a ) , the &quot; older driver &quot; means , fal@@ sely - perhaps also with mal@@ icious background thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; translated .
the wrong translation was made from 1 to 20 September on electronic read@@ ings in the entrance area and in the building itself .
handling the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , divided into the social media .
the mistake was the translator Julian Holmes , a inhabitants of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also who made the local lo@@ ids carefully .
the Kyoto , Kyoto , which appeared in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that nobody has read the translation of the translation .
this is an ins@@ ult for elderly people and in an international city as Kyoto just un@@ acceptable , &quot; Holmes said .
the f@@ law@@ ed English translation was initially removed . the designation &quot; Mount drivers &quot; ( german : &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate but gramm@@ atically not entirely correct name &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older driver &quot; ) .
the police in Kyoto pre@@ dict@@ ated for the translation errors . furthermore , it declared that the error was already contained in the text that they had received from trans@@ lators , and that the translation was not tested for their correc@@ t@@ ness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really sorry that older people felt by inadequate correction ( translation ) in our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News sat down with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older driver in Japan , and wrote :
the word &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of the drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents are still relevant to concern .
in the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture , for example , 1.@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this represents a percentage of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors 1,@@ 80@@ 3 caused a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents .
with this , their share increased to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased , the proportion of sen@@ iors caused by sen@@ iors have increased in the same period .
the nam@@ ing non @-@ mentioned rep@@ orters published in the article published by the article comments to light , showing the pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese seem@@ ingly against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo via the translation error received following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the translation is not at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so common in Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure tro@@ ve for this bizarre mistake in English .
photo of Flick@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of transmission errors are varied .
to translate , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the text @-@ text and active language skills to send him to the target language .
the latter requires the active master@@ y of the target language - something that is in the case of parent language . in general , the conviction that trans@@ lators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native language .
for example , a French native speaker should be translated from English to French - not by French into English .
photo of Flick@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies don &apos;t employ a staff with English as a mother tongue who could translate translations into English . this may be lacking understanding of the over@@ setting , cost @-@ being , or the relatively low number of English native speakers that learn Japanese .
some companies that have no foreign employees themselves , do not produce fir@@ ming translations . then the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is considered the best , to trans@@ lators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo of Flick@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with fun results .
the ver@@ dic@@ ated and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences , which arise through machine translations , show that technology can not yet replace a human trans@@ lators . this applies to some languages very special .
some of the stran@@ gest English for@@ mut@@ ations in Japan , among them also the en@@ ig@@ matic prints that often decor@@ ate T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for stylish reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo of Flick@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or acceptable as jewelry , or at least harmless . but by big companies or from the government that have the resources to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
the City of Kyoto , in future , uses a serious source for their translations .
Venezuela : protest and Ci@@ ens@@ orship on the Internet and Television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ elan Internet users , that they would have no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online station .
later another user wrote that the internet appearances of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV are no longer accessible .
other online channels also contributed to the protests in Caracas , which were organized by op@@ position@@ ist groups , against the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dis@@ band@@ ed the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos Dí@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was connected , and recommended users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that internet sites Venezu@@ elan provider are locked once again .
this is from the site of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been on the reporting on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission threatened them with fin@@ es and closure if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission looked for &quot; Call to Viol@@ ence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels , I registered myself at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that this is still cheaper than to buy two litres of lim@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ in@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by a blocking of the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two other online stations . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transfers their sessions .
earlier research studies of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , showed that the local Internet provider will sometimes utili@@ ze DNA . this is a technology through which the DNS servers of certain domains are correct .
if a website is blocked by the DNA , the server respon@@ ds or ref@@ uses to send the request to such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ ap@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
on V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the broadcast was set on Thursday , April 6th , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera &apos;s Elvis Flo@@ res , who carried the protests in Caracas , was taken into custody .
Flo@@ res was beaten , while he was in custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels still have access to YouTube , the government is reported to have access to the Internet connections : the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ an@@ ern will continue to keep access to multi @-@ media coverage of the current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls will become a slave to get an apprentic@@ eship
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she is visiting the house where she worked for years .
today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collec@@ ts testimony of other Cri@@ adi@@ tas who were just like the victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a Concise , published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , &quot; slo@@ ping schools &quot; ) , edited and restored by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , in which she was not working together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her graduation from the university , she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride on her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
the one has become something , &quot; she said .
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . when Cri@@ adi@@ tas are known to work in Paraguay , more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the shop is quite simple : a big family with little money over their min@@ ors son or her under@@ age daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof over the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to pay for countless days of house@@ work , which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that as part of a treaty you cannot raise .
this practice described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widely used in Paraguay due to participation and acceptance by large parts of the society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations .
after completing his studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected witness testimon@@ ies , re@@ cher@@ ished and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call things in the name , because the feeling of gratitude , that will be vacc@@ inated with the Cri@@ adi@@ tas , will not be silent in general .
&quot; Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is the family that will improve their daughter in the faith that they can close their training , improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something from itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the family that puts the girl with itself and justi@@ fies the exploitation of faith that she would give someone a chance , who would otherwise have received no training , and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
if the girl is har@@ assed , his family will experience many years later .
sometimes they never learn about it .
in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , became a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of fierce battles . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military @-@ affiliated Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as an official at the residents of the population .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
by the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira struck off as long as a stick on Mar@@ ín until they suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported about the incident .
they empha@@ sized that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organisations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society responsible for the death of the girl .
they identified the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest together and demanded that there will be no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , among which terms boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded an important investigation .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case is before the court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be landmark - if the first time in the history there is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go before the Court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited than labour , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , where her father worked , had to subscribe and her father lost his job .
her brothers had to work all and started to sell money on the street or on the market cand@@ y to earn money .
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of their employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
she had to share the time so that you still had time for learning .
it stood up at 5 o &apos;clock every morning and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
Fri@@ days for example , she cleans@@ ed the fridge , washed the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more they had done with learning , the more free time she had .
but even this time was limited , because they had to make dinner for their employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but did not get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to take more books from the library of the house as a food from the fridge , &quot; she remembers .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the master , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
on several occasions the master of the house Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , in addition to him stand and read Editorial from opposition , such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
in doing so , he tried to convince her , to give the reports of the official media on the regime &apos;s regime .
he retained her for intelligent , but not with her . &quot; the master of the house had found somebody who listened , while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family because they were the opinion that I heard there again &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; so they supposed that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani who would speak at home again their native language Guar@@ an@@ í . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord feared that they had allowed the education that they had enabled to lose , she explains .
however , it was completely clear that they had paid for everything they had paid from them with their hard work .
also in the school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated . &quot; one thing about which is almost never spoken , are bul@@ lying and the ch@@ ic@@ ans that Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exposed to school when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , during the time of friend@@ ships I sens@@ ed , I felt particularly clear that I didn &apos;t belong to any group .
the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a explains .
society appro@@ ves Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can share job advertis@@ ements for cleaning staff and kinder@@ garten in Paraguay .
the administr@@ ators of the group is P@@ EPA Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city council in the As@@ unci@@ on district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and afternoon with her .
to learn .
please support you .
starting from Monday , when possible .
the display received five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the town Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she could have had one year old girl and gave her phone number .
another woman who came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very hand@@ some , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third commentary was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the state inner that wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the editor of the ad was closed again :
dear friends , I have found one . I saw if it works with her .
thanks , I write to you again , if something is .
the business was complete .
in the pro@@ log report for Cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long nor ? ) , a collection of testimony of a former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ tiz :
in the course of our history , we managed to abol@@ ish systems like slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice of the early Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ ers ) , which the Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores had given them tri@@ butes , and the Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ ani ( which the workers had to be regarded as Hal@@ b slaves ) , and that many girls and boys will be willing to provide himself in a system of slavery , where they become easy victim for abuse and exploitation .
social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the vision of power are known to the understanding of the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
draft bill writes Egyptian users social media to register in the government
image of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changes from Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections recently agreed a bill to &quot; the reg@@ ression regarding the usage and commercial social networks . &quot;
if he is accepted by Parliament , users of social media must be registered in Egypt at a government office to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
on the basis of the law , a place would be set up , which is to be commissioned to share citizenship and citizens to share social media .
within six months with acceptance of the law , user accounts and users have to register on the site of the site with their right names and staff numbers to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do this , this could bring a sentence of up to six months in jail or a fine of money .
the bill , which consists of six par@@ agra@@ ph@@ s and in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that runs over the internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video surveillance and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is passed when the law is assumed , as Egyptian authorities are supposed to be imposed on users , such as Egyptian authorities , who do not register , considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media company .
Ri@@ y@@ ad@@ h Abdul Satt@@ ar , member of parliament and promot@@ er of the Law Fir@@ m , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name and password &quot; by the fire@@ wall that blocked Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to set a fire@@ wall around national level around Facebook . because of those it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians , to submit information on their identity to access the network .
but it &apos;s not known yet , that such plans exist .
experts and experts are skep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ic@@ ulty ( in German &quot; Senior Research Institute &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt strongly to the technical capacities and understanding of each authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they are violent physical public and private rooms , it could also be done online .
when I take it seriously , this means that they are able to set up a strong monitoring system to apply for citizens who apply a permit or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to carry out a judicial process .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legisl@@ ature and the Constitutional Court before it de@@ buted in the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and en@@ forcement will succeed or not , the draft &quot; is consistent with a pro @-@ military thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the image area , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the par@@ liament@@ arian T@@ amer El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a legislative proposal against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life imprisonment for those were intended to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

high above in the mountains of Kurdistan in the northeast of Iraq , the Z@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and their team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq work to protect the am@@ bition Persian leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the bigger family of leop@@ ards , which strike through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to wil@@ der@@ ei , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and as they will always find less lo@@ ot , endangered .
why is this particular type of leop@@ ards so important ?
as R@@ aza shows up in the video , &quot; the Per@@ s@@ ische Leopard is the only remaining pir@@ ate in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and growth of ecos@@ ystem depends on that a big pre@@ dat@@ ory is present .
the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ard in fact is small and goes against zero . when the team rests in the video that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , R@@ aza breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained biolog@@ ist , R@@ aza passionate loves to treat another side of their country , which is not only from war and conflict .
it has been involved in campaigns for six years in field studies of wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq .
it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and assumes that protection zones for wild animals in the Kurdistan region have been established .

at the beginning of March 2017 , documented in the nor@@ theastern Japan , daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress made in the last six years have been affected by the &quot; Thir@@ ty disaster &quot; of March 2011 . an enormous earthquake , a tsunami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , located in the Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture was a et@@ rable pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring islands of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to attack , because the tsunami had van@@ ished whole coastal cities from the map .
in addition , Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture experienced a nuclear accident , even so alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows a local view that progress has been achieved six years later in order to re @-@ establish the life of local buildings .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of Japanese re@@ building authority and pol@@ l results of the affected themselves .
the housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts ( b@@ az@@ a@@ ha@@ de@@ an , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was the largest success under the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima with 70 percent is the final light .
even six years after the disaster , ev@@ ac@@ uation of heating revenues ( b@@ az@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) is still trying to settle in final replacement parts .
after the thre@@ ef@@ old catastrophe , almost 80 000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ving shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 we still lived 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate .
almost 40 percent of the global fleet of ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation , which were fin@@ alised after the disaster in housing sub@@ divisions , were res@@ ett@@ led in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate the number is 34 percent .
working and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools have returned from mis@@ fortune , that opens their gates up to December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures are far more difficult .
while almost 100 percent of the har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ates and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now back into operation , in Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of fish@@ eries har@@ bors their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
the tsunami and nuclear accident , in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land have greatly affected .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the agriculture in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of destroying farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic fact , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 acres of destroyed fields of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are located in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism extensively recovered , but Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains far off here .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent in the same state as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , on the other hand , can be only 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that since the disaster has almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their livel@@ ihood .
is the local population being prepared for the next big earthqu@@ akes ?
in order to determine a total image , the newspaper led numerous surveys conducted among the native population and ev@@ ac@@ uation by the ev@@ ac@@ uation . she asked them about the status of reconstruction and , as well as their indig@@ nation has changed over the tsunami @-@ risk .
in her introduction of the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey in order to bring more about the tsunami consciousness under the native population .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents who have taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and tsun@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respondents say that still not enough in disasters prevention was done .
what about those who were ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture
in its issue to the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has strengthened its attention also to the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima had not only had to experience the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture was also witness the worst , disast@@ rous cause , nuclear failure , the Japan ever had to experience .
of 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were installed in areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , slightly more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , had been res@@ ett@@ led in permanent spare parts .
after 2017 , more than 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima live outside their home pre@@ fecture .
in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation areas are older than 50 years old . you have to reg@@ ain the efforts for reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . this is about construction projects , which are part of the Olympic Games in Tokyo that will take place in Tokyo .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries , which speak a different language , the differences appear to be larger than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , one often recogni@@ zes that one more links than it seems to be at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remember that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at this global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we treat topics that often get less attention in reporting often than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strong with someone about lingu@@ istic and country borders .
Veron@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ i explains how the love for music has worked in rural China ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time she worked with people from around the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences , which he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered during a week in the intensive care station . last Friday , a police officer had defeated him during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a impact stock against the head . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against savings .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studying social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , studied a brain trau@@ ma and suffered several frac@@ tures .
doctors made him this Saturday and now put it into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local picture journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which quickly spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the images , too , the face of the police officers came to identify with a ra@@ vine . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident the military police arrested in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the conclusion of the incident at the incident of the active service .
the pictures show the police officers , as he strikes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officers were audi@@ ted by a prot@@ esters and land on the intensive care station , his face would be six months in TV and the whole supp@@ ression would thus be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , divided by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by police officers and several remedi@@ es briefly .
another video of the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also immer@@ sed in social networks .
in the below shown clip , one sees the attack on Mat@@ eus off the 50th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users now donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ an Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to stay a part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay at Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while staying in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police force . &quot;

on Facebook Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political violence : here , the activist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish from his father was assass@@ inated because he was assass@@ inated the Occup@@ y Movement in Sek@@ und@@ ar@@ øy . and now we have been attacked by the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who was attacked by police officers who attacked him with a stroke of police .
police transfer
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where it came to prot@@ esters last Friday .
police officers were set at the protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where prot@@ esters had built a stage for Red@@ ner , Gum@@ mig@@ raine and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
member of Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police via lou@@ dness to ren@@ ounce violence against prot@@ esters .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again the Brazilian media protests have tu@@ cked , by putting the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ ec@@ on@@ ists : a window wind@@ shield .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported targeted information about a shred@@ ded glass window to illustrate their cover pages .
however , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a set @-@ up bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken wind@@ shield than the protests people who serve the defence of a special thing .
this must also be recognized , if it is strictly forbidden against any form of failure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is also given a absurd , un@@ parall@@ eled meaning , and the typical violent acts of military police are sent by headlines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on confron@@ tation with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
those of the de@@ contamination of forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the Act of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar@@ cane factories in Cuba opened the doors . ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - known , regardless of its that there is no notable sugar harvest on site .
it is two years since the activities were paraly@@ zed in the sugar@@ cane factory .
after the fall , the sugar@@ cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its plants , until only the rum@@ or of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others signed and comm@@ utes daily to the factories , which still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a Sol@@ dat@@ env@@ y , which is open every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not w@@ ander his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar@@ cane factories in the east of the region , which are back in operation after a long in@@ active time , because they were received .
that was something he was not expecting .
N@@ ene remembers exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would receive the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry has already with@@ stood the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , the bad administrative decisions , and climate change .
in 2016 the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced .
the news would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no more news anymore .
why was Cuban sugar@@ cane industry turned off ?
the old railway bridge of the village looked even better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the cr@@ ushing of the sugar@@ cane industry was an economical necessity : the 155 sugar mills were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive , they were un@@ sustainable for the country .
the initial idea was to focus on the production of most efficient factories , the annual production facility was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories which can produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.0@@ 3 euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar@@ cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the global market .
nevertheless , the sugar price desc@@ ended before about a decade .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 Report , published by the OECD and FAO , the UN and Food and Agriculture Organization .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tons ) , the raw sugar rate would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; the present day is to go into history with safety in history , &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o .
the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
during the following years , the dis@@ closure of a total of 98 sugar@@ cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as a soldier , is known about the closure of the factory , is the word that he repe@@ ats the most , &quot; fraud . &quot;
almost all respondents in the same opinion is not one of them informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order to maintain the place , they formed a full time - working group .
before the first sight , the first letters began to come .
it was officially referred to as official documents , which would only be removed in terms of parts that would be removed , the address sat and the date distinguished .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could make any withdrawal .
the responsibility was taken over there , and the letters were more common .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the set @-@ up factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still used sugar@@ cane factories . &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waits for retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved with his will at the de@@ commissioning of the factory , in which construction he helped .
in every part he took away , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 years .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the main workplace producer was wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the work@@ stations and services to gener@@ alise the facilities in the communities where they were located .
we will never know if during the Mamm@@ ut speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then President in the eyes of the present people saw when he guaranteed that their factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run smoothly .
price of the population for the closure of sugar@@ cane factories
since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only high by gr@@ ind .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the national community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich met that many things are changing , but not getting better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar@@ cane factory closed , or better said when they began to break them out , they also listened to the road to asph@@ alted , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they became a spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people left the region .
in the area a food mill was created , whose production serves not even for the provision of the church .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant remains impressive .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he started working .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty crow@@ ned the old soldiers a retirement of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month to spend the years retired in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear@@ er voice , is not a contra@@ sting person , yet he gives the lies that they told him not .
she has tor@@ ment him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes to retirement age 65 years , not because it l@@ acks force , but because he is bit@@ tered .

first Nations youth use hip @-@ hop to express itself and maintain their own culture
recording a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an .
young People &apos;s First Nations communities in all of Canada deal with topics that are important for them . they do with hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
since 2014 , as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an Tour has been bringing mobile audi@@ ts directly to schools and youth centres to teach groups of song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were conducted by the ped@@ ago@@ gues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and in North @-@ Quebec with ten crew communities and then with the Cre@@ e hip @-@ hop group The North@@ stars .
the workshop goes out that the young participants in talks topics such as &quot; cultural identity , speech , discussion , love , self @-@ exclusion &quot; or what is coming to them in mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , in which the young@@ sters are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the strain of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the US state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
for example , this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears &quot; on a road in West@@ kan@@ ada , where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered .
the cases were mostly not explained .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First nation uses the motive of a video player to conv@@ ey how important of the ob@@ taining traditional customs and customs , despite the influences of glob@@ alisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people don &apos;t always master the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First nation has recorded , the refra@@ in will be sung on Cre@@ e .
the people involved here received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Group , who received a St@@ roph@@ one in the dial@@ ect of Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ side of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an , the St@@ rop@@ he is available in a tran@@ script , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody ever interest in myself
but I try to go on earth after my days
that &apos;s the day you won our cry ?
because we have lost our way in life as a youth .
but I believe that we will rise to one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and be prec@@ eded by our youth .
thus , they can do that , why it dict@@ ates the Creator .

in Japan plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( tu@@ b@@ bing , p@@ tu@@ b@@ ings ) outside a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan one can see in front of almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
to show potential customers what is right on the menu , are located near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( b@@ az@@ zy , &quot; Plas@@ tic@@ ular models of the dishes &quot; ) are served by every food that is served in this restaurant .
customers see this plastic dishes , decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry that is dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
in the to@@ ki@@ oter district K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there is a variety of these small businesses that include those plastic dishes , which documented the German filmmaker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a before over 20 years ago .
most of the Japanese are these plastic dishes so usually that they do not catch them more . however , a new trend does not transform them today in show@@ y mobile phone accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series published series of social media links and photos that illustrate this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in the special sale : new with plastic shred@@ ded mobile phones , as they can be shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods were transformed to kit@@ sch@@ y collec@@ ts , as in this case , refriger@@ ator@@ mag@@ nets :
here are a few shooting refriger@@ ator@@ mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of the essenti@@ als is increasingly complex .
in this case , a cave @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was turned into a mobile phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile phone support .
we also manufactured this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple holding her cell :
designed to look like an apple , featuring a candle for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing attraction to the county .
some mobile phone support and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura and salmon is che@@ ated , a popular T@@ opping , which is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wow , cool , now I can decor@@ ate my mobile phone with laughing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic bags can also receive a less appeti@@ zing form , for example , colleagues or family members un@@ pleas@@ antly too .
our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice cream .
in addition , there are also Rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , Ear@@ rings and mol@@ yb@@ den@@ ers from dried salmon .
other sk@@ inn@@ ed plastic dishes can be found under : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # Three @-@ tu@@ b@@ bing .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trends , this video gives you an insight into the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , which is dedicated to the sh@@ ale of the restaurant industry . for example , with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug dealers &quot; in Mexico , the de@@ mi@@ sts and killed regularly occur in statistics . however , this reflects the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings with itself .
the reporting of drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pressed the stories of the conflict completely in the background .
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the mourning or the commun@@ es that have learned to live with pain .
behind each body , behind each bone , in the centuries secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never heal .
therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has created the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ enti@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drug trade ) , the victims should give a voice and tells stories of people who were involved in the struggle between law en@@ forcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project :
organized crime cannot only fear our lives .
the implic@@ ations are much deeper .
for example , if shops close , because they are threatened by drug dealers and all municipalities need to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk .
pain of victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( german : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear@@ ful life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells about these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who is looking for secret tom@@ bs after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez who lost their father &apos;s four sisters , her husband and two brothers .
priest : &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves back the task again today , which we have asked us to go , and after the tom@@ bs we have loved to look for . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in a power business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13th he left the house .
on October 15th he would be back again , but he never came again . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me because I am now alone with three children who need a training .
there is also my mother , who is here with me .
at the moment they have no income .
you are standing by my father &apos;s insurance , but they don &apos;t pay them out because they require a death certificate .
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we must not only show the faces of those who imagine fear . we have to show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the sovereign power .
the project is based on stories by readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this contribution from Tax@@ co , in the federal state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that men should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have already known illness and sens@@ ations for some years now .
I am passing through newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the cover pages with pictures , which actually can only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from acqu@@ iring specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one I &apos;ve got or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 year old cousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if it is great . and it is also not normal that people can hear songs about the &quot; hel@@ pers &quot; of offen@@ ders when they walk through the streets .
for me it is , as if they have lost those who have lost someone , and those who are afraid that something happens to them as well .
I see our weakness when stories are being exposed to naked numbers in a statistic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of people is unbelievable for me if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students are justified in a neighboring village that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they &apos;re trying to talk , that they have spar@@ ed themselves of such trage@@ dies if they are not stirring and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the main city district : &quot; it describes how an armed stat@@ utory month for month money was pressed by their business until they had not only destroyed the business , but also their families torn apart .
you think of everything you lost , and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days .
pain never goes away , the sad@@ ness remains , the fear comes up again , if you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the more we are removed , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because they don &apos;t know when they will take you or kill .
I was asked in these horri@@ ble days whether wines my profound feelings would dissolve , but the answers is no , because I forgot how to weep . I need to learn how to live with pain .
journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the contribution &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
what is it like to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Bryan is a Wa@@ ise and he tells that he had to teach himself , how to make an egg coo@@ ks , potatoes br@@ ushes , tortillas warm , and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies that dwell with him . this is his name for the preparation of fl@@ acon with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother would have disappeared .
but this was not the day that his childhood ended .
his childhood was already past two years earlier , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , the bloody suffering of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Bryan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Bryan was born in 2006 , as violence caused by the organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Council of Public Safety and the Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the public prosecutor called 3@@ 103 murders . this equ@@ ates to average 8.5 Mor@@ den per day .
these are only a few hundreds of thousands of stories that organised the organized crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate into the soul of the country .
few stories are still living in the face of new headlines . but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ enti@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has set up the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 , whose goal is to depic@@ t the complex information behind the failed fighting against drug dealers , who has tor@@ mented the country in the past four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; Sh@@ aring is Car@@ ing &quot; from the Flick@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) WH@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this entry and the pages where it is linked , contain pictures on which violence is represented .
the factor check is important in a moment where it is about to take out a rum@@ or or to create a fake .
but how is the years after having appeared the first time ? content in social media , whether it &apos;s true or true , ten@@ ds to exist further .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first release , it has been used mis@@ leading , trage@@ dies that have occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false Cou@@ pling of Image and Event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - den@@ ies not the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting on events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desires to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker stir@@ red up the place San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te and explo@@ ded . 230 people were killed .
after civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglec@@ ted and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become scar@@ c@@ eful tre@@ ads , which were difficult to drive .
trag@@ ically , the tank of tan@@ ker fell victim .
master@@ ing representatives described a fire@@ ball , dozens of houses , including a movie theaters , which was full of people that illustrate the football World Cup .
houses disper@@ sed and stolen bodies were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the god@@ liness .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur users My@@ stic Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident make the grey scenes this day .
above is an example .
there are rows of knot@@ ted bodies attached to the ground , while they have a look at them .
but here the story is not its end .
over the years the same photo has been recorded several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but not to be attributed to the trage@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the dra@@ gon@@ an towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
witnesses reported dras@@ tically of atro@@ cities , in which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and car@@ cases were burned down in streets and bus@@ hes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; no one remained back to count bodies , &quot; said a inhabit@@ ant to Human Rights Watch .
many were crushed , shot or burnt .
the follow @-@ up time could only be displayed only from satellite images .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ explained , but the conservation status in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared back when it was wron@@ g@@ ly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place in Paris for two days .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ chiev@@ ous use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented assign@@ ments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was taken as a proof for Mass@@ ages .
another step further bring personal comments such as this example , from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in relation to supply arguments .
the picture from San@@ ge was also in connection with the fatal persecution of the Muslim co@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar in Myanmar .
according to a flash message , published by the United Nations , those who could flee could hit strokes , rape and some dead , some by burning .
while others reported the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , according to the following , the following descriptions brought together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from a Saudi Arabian news page , which was fal@@ sely claimed that President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ a has said that monks and politicians were involved in the assassination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to educ@@ ate this information .
the original contribution will be accessed on April 26 , 2017 , and can be accessed here .
other news organizations running AFP than their source , had wron@@ g@@ ly attributed to Th@@ ought His testimony , but did not allow the image of the DR Congo in connection .
the world wide range of false information
traces of these false cl@@ ut@@ ations go back to the years 2011 and 2012 , and actually come from all over the world .
using a &quot; reverse image search &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders .
a reverse picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 344 at 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 344 images which are very similar to the mentioned picture of the DR Congo .
they come from a mixer , private parties , platforms of social media and community and national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have been for@@ warded to false reports , others tried to un@@ masks the counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s .
we have submitted examples of ab@@ used use and brought them into connection with the respective countries , based on what site they have been published . thus , we want to represent the reach more clearly than by the language alone .
several examples of mis@@ use are used from the listed countries ( which are also linked in some cases ) .
here are some cases that can now be experienced completely ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News fra@@ mes .
country example of false copy of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the or@@ derly countries prove to pages or servers , where examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ seh@@ ood are still available .
the countries in grey include examples which are available according to met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available via the Tin@@ Eye , probably also maturity examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Alg@@ iers and interested Arabs ) as part of a Th@@ reads to the &quot; War of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

one side that makes it clear , questioned the question that the said photo Christians shows that Muslims were killed by Muslims .
Canada , 2015 .
this article ren@@ ames a blo@@ gger from Quebec City not only the fal@@ seh@@ ood , but also discuss the mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions according to the intention of persons and the resulting trage@@ dies ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los cris@@ ti@@ anos &quot; ( in Nigeria they burn the Christians ) .
this article about explo@@ sions in North @-@ Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , is identified as the Christian part of the place .
La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica quoted as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( whereby not known is whether the original report has the picture ) .
France , 2015 .

this article makes reference to the ongoing emergency of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims in Myanmar , but quoted the work of an article by Indian Express with the image of the DR Congo ; the article by Indian Express had not included this picture at the time of the publication of our contribution .

this side used the image as a proof that Muslims kill Nig@@ erian Christians .
this asser@@ tion was di@@ spro@@ ved from a Greek fact @-@ check @-@ side in 2013 and again in 2016 .
Iran , 2012 .
a association of students of the@@ ology ( Mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims in the support agency N@@ asi@@ m and used the illustration of the DR Congo .

Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from the DR Congo was the evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am bombing in public discussions .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example for a mis@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , with its part of a Twe@@ et , the sympathy against the Nig@@ erian massacre and on the other hand , the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the claims that the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persecuted , while the photos were ab@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government published a judge for what she conceived as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inten@@ tional news and photos that came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ concep@@ tions concerning Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this judge , which appeared exclusively in English , includes references to fake pictures of o@@ do@@ urs , the H@@ ate speech run and from extrem@@ ist groups to kill that Muslims Budd@@ hi@@ sts kill and elsewhere ( which often is often used by bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , which established itself to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly indicates that the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims that Christians kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ought has been granted in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story with the image from San@@ ge .
the article was updated in 2014 and this release is still included in this publication .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 about students who have been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic Church of An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has explicitly stated that the image is not taken from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it was a &quot; similar d@@ att@@ st attack . &quot;
as the picture later in connection with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in circulation in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were links to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ j@@ ery@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ fer@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) .
the picture of the DR Congo met with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dissolved a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities took these events that were alleged in the name of the Islam@@ s , a greater attention .
United States , 2015 .
the picture has been tagged as proof of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times saved ) , but the messages that were associated with it were not adopted in any religious context .
instead , the goal of preparing attention to the relative number of dead and a comparison of media coverage in the comparison of Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnamese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was supposed to have been written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Martos - written about the Nig@@ erian massacres , there were some discussion forums on Vietnamese and declared it to counterfeit .
from the message in which the picture was included from the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine mission@@ aries and Fr Juan Carlos Martos are dist@@ ressed .
there are further examples of a defective use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
to other accounts , ag@@ gregate and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in Grau ) shows Tin@@ Eye also , but are no longer trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data agreements with UR@@ Ls and tim@@ est@@ amps , exist on the Web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and occasionally they have imag@@ inations in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared clearly after the original disaster of 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
fra@@ mes and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( ir@@ radiation ) that go through these posts . the first frame is focused on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to larger discussions about the silence on the silence of Christians through Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second Fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued as a European or French life .
religion can understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth to examine how pictures are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens if readers cannot give these pictures longer faith .
with social media , there are poor people who have un@@ inten@@ tionally concerned about drinking water around a tragedy .
suggests this mood of mis@@ chief and mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and tasted the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of non@@ violent images has been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that it returns from pictures of a ref@@ usal to recognise the tragedy . sometimes these pictures even demands by the victims himself .
at the same time concern , concern that violent images of readers and audience des@@ en@@ si@@ zing and to them the ability to emp@@ athy emp@@ athy ( such as this study , who sought how violent media seem to help others ) .
while there are some more violent represent@@ ations in the news media , the fact that it is essential for today &apos;s news coverage .
techn@@ ologists experiment with algorithms to support the struggle against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; you will find thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something suggests , but it can be used completely from context or fully ab@@ used manner .
every investigation of false statements , however , should take into consideration how international they can be .

a blog with the name of un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. in@@ exagger@@ ated ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiastic a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult , or not to be translated .
there are such words in each language : you press some situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these unnecessary words are already well @-@ known ( like the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others that are ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ jour@@ esa ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
one word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a bit context are required to understand what this word is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list .
most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and Lingu@@ ist from &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find some words from V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ ba to get your parents in recognition , as for your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ q language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :

in Bir@@ ds own words in his blog About :
they deri@@ ves other cultures , reveal other thoughts and wake up our curiosity .
sometimes you influence the world around us and classi@@ fy the Lingu@@ ists on this page still want to publish and show more of these &quot; unnecessary &quot; words and show how different , valuable , and impressive to these small languages .

how Sri Lanka is changing the worst floo@@ ding of the decade
the island state Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ding and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by Mon@@ sun , which is normally employed by the end of May , rivers cal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya entered the shore in 15 bor@@ ou@@ gh@@ s in the south and west of the country over the shore .
following a statement of the disaster reform of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missed due to floods and fight win@@ ches .
over 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100 000 people were brought to 304 secure residence types .
the rain was left on Saturday ( 27 May ) and the waters in some areas moved slowly .
health and hygiene of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected and still un@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos conv@@ ey an impression of the extent of the flood catastrophe :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7,5 metres . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka are providing regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the den@@ gue crisis , save the Children , after further re@@ signs are already on the way .
today the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood at floods , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ all likewise flooded because of the water p@@ eg@@ s of Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five planes for rescue operations and another five will be completed for transport@@ ing emer@@ gen@@ cies in their flooded villages .
different organizations and star@@ tu@@ ps have also been ready to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od V@@ ICT@@ I@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ons for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this field .
the tax@@ ir@@ uf @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their site data with the help of the app to be informed of the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum .
last year after the disaster of the Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ ms Ro@@ anu , Pick@@ Me brought a &quot; high water support &quot; button , allowing users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . these were then for@@ warded to the Sri Lan@@ kan Red Cross .

the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
use permission . I took part in San Francisco on Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and loving girlfriend .
I trusted her four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in one minute we call par@@ ol@@ es for women &apos;s rights .
in the next scope , we suggest rights for trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some keep the iconic picture of a woman with head@@ scarf , bound from an american flag , other sk@@ inn@@ ed par@@ ole against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my friend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not the Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led these entertainment already .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years , separ@@ ating me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built in their not@@ ion .
they were mus@@ li@@ fied me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be Muslim , in different art . but somehow we are all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well designed in our collective idea that as soon as Muslims do not fit there , be mus@@ cled .
discharge processes are being dischar@@ ged
I don &apos;t get it alone .
this is even the poet , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what pictures come in one of the senses , when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was so old as I was now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the western sight , religion was deleted by Rum@@ is as well as from the most popular translations of poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large proportion of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists in the re@@ frac@@ tive images of Muslims that en@@ cap@@ tiv@@ ating western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the landmark Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward Said , in the 1970s , put the story behind these images .
but these pictures continue to stand still today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to continue .
I &apos;ve been working for thirteen years in the news industry and I saw how this powerful , faul@@ t@@ less nar@@ rative are domin@@ ating our new@@ s@@ feeds .
this nar@@ rative is the reality that nine Muslim women have led their countries during the last three decades , while the USA could not even choose their first female Presi@@ dential candidate in 2016 .
this nar@@ rative fails to recognise that if French , Muslim women are inhi@@ bited to carry their head@@ scarf in public buildings and to cover Saudi Arab , Muslim women through their government to cover the entire body , which are both two sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group practices his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this severe nar@@ rative weak@@ ens Muslim women , the movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans , which had been brought into slavery with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this nar@@ rative is communic@@ ated deeply and in@@ correct that often Si@@ kh @-@ men and children become the target of stimul@@ us attacks and ch@@ ic@@ an@@ ings .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell it is Islam@@ opho@@ bia today not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also do Nar@@ rative , who help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the nar@@ rative of 1.7 billion .
and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims comprise the highest degree of &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than one third of the total Muslim population are African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants who come from 77 countries .
the parents of the author 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago , my immig@@ rant parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid their first jewelry design in 5th Avenue , and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American mathemati@@ cian from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan was thinking over the world &apos;s Sky@@ lines , my parents were forced Muslims and Americans .
but am I un@@ changing Muslim and American ?
sometimes , if people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork meat , I say - instead of getting my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chiefs who carry all Muslims with themselves - &quot; from respect to Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ esting , we don &apos;t wear all T@@ ash@@ y@@ or@@ ans with us .
we also have to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who endeav@@ oured to fight widespread lies over Islam .
these lies are produced on the current band by a well @-@ ador@@ ned Islam@@ opho@@ bia , think tanks and experts for counterfeit information , which is already a f@@ law@@ ed picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell it , Islam@@ opho@@ bia are in more than just a stranger who breaks the head of a woman .
or as the sc@@ ary map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole USA , see below .

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ugly forms interfer@@ es with our affili@@ ation .
it attacks our identity , which is so extensive , so versatile and complex that it can be impossible to fit into a drawer .
the author was founded in 1986 on a photo of her children &apos;s kinder@@ g@@ art@@ group .
use approved .
I want to explain that .
I was born as the Muslim but a Muslim was born only when I was four years old , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
if social scientist describe religious life , they refer to the following terms : faith , behavior , and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavi@@ ours are perhaps not always visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neighbor , my rock in the surf , that I am Muslim if they could look for the 15 @-@ meter concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would like to see the evening ritual with my daughter when I held her in my arms , and you are called the Arab verses to protect the Koran and called the Q@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask therefore that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one can &apos;t see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mus@@ li@@ mic faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow .
the grand@@ ma of the author , when she wins an Ik@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , with their sisters sometime pos@@ ing in the 1960s .
use approved .
belonging to my grandmother , the image of my grandmother , is maternal , with their sisters ; how they win a competition of art of floral arranged in Kar@@ achi for decades .
it is the picture of her that I see in this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished paintings , Su@@ fi @-@ saint ; and a basket with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and four@@ teen chapters which she can close almost .
the Muslim means to speak the prayers , which they said to me , if I have a bad day .
to be Muslim , as she taught me to relate to God : Allah is Mi@@ an what God means , my only Lord .
for a people that has been en@@ cap@@ itali@@ zed by a &quot; empire &quot; that a company has created with the name of ven@@ erable British Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to call my only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
affili@@ ation means to grow and hear that men don &apos;t cry , but at the same time you can see that my own grandfather is weeping .
zw@@ isch@@ rin , while he writes books on modern Islam and over the independence K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana J@@ aan un@@ coated with his family in India , K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he was not allowed to close into his arms in half a century .
belonging to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians , whose families , like at my grandfather , were torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists , who have divided the Muslim world as at the game risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Muslim means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colonial countries &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bom@@ b@@ ance of history &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was cast over a century above a Muslim country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an intimate , kiss of the British Empire , called &quot; dangerous &quot; from the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous , &quot; as he led the first mosque in England .
before it was planes , he traveled in more parts of the world when I was ever and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion belonging to my Muslim tribe , our unforgettable family trees are back . our un@@ il@@ and@@ oned story .
it means that four@@ teen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops , distributed over each continent apart from Antar@@ c@@ tica , were distributed to Iraq in order to pursue mass destruction of mass destruction that were not existed .
it means to know that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an American Muslim means to know that the suicide rate of veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means knowing that if a tragedy is home to the US and susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that over ten hundred years ago the first prayer @-@ call , the Az@@ aan , was called by an exemp@@ t black slaves with the name Bil@@ al .
it means that two hundred years ago , an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ l@@ aved and brought to this country .
it means that Malcolm X is a American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people filled the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand for our dreams and when we say black life .
an American woman , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim and a journalist , signi@@ fies the inher@@ ent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our with multiple hy@@ d@@ ders , but to fail to communicate her on others .
the nar@@ rative of 1,7 billion has more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in reducing branches , &quot; we &quot; against &quot; them . &quot;
a mother means to worry about my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged persons build structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in the Muslim Regi@@ ons which began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama .
it exists in trans@@ lu@@ ent monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it is in immigration li@@ king , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that surro@@ unds its borders opposite people from the countries that bom@@ bed it .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly list , &quot; which largely decreases Arabs and Muslims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are wars that we lead and the bombs we dis@@ card on Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those who don &apos;t tell us , we are here today .
in a study with the title A@@ scent of Man , scientists from North@@ western University participants showed a scientific un@@ true image and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding evolution .
Muslims got the lowest score .
the conversation we have to lead
we are too deep to reveal the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
we are decades back to recognize the roots of our fears , and the f@@ law@@ less and dangerous @-@ expression forms which we have in our news inter@@ actions .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which tries to capture our many times with connec@@ tive identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the pod@@ cast Sea Some@@ thing , Say Some@@ thing from Bu@@ zz@@ ling ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Muslim Bad@@ Muslim ; the vir@@ ale video series Secret Li@@ ves of the Black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , multiplied Muslim authors , and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IST@@ AN@@ ISH , Muslim , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .
screen@@ shots from media initiatives to show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality Muslim American life .
coll@@ age of the author .
but I &apos;m concerned because of this difficult global time @-@ point where we are located .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now run the White House .
they have grown exp@@ on@@ ential because they have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally , by creating the &quot; others . &quot;
a few years previously it had not been given ; now they domin@@ ate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am worried about the re@@ alities and history I was not aware when I was so old as it is now my daughter , but who made me today a sudden Muslim .
things I have left here like a bread@@ lane in my speech .
things that are perhaps rec@@ olle@@ ctions , because in all the inter@@ sec@@ ctions that make our humanity , likes a story , where someone is made to &quot; others . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversation takes place within the 8th Annual Meeting of Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than one hundred acade@@ m@@ ician speak about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American milit@@ ar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are no terms with which we throw in our schools to us or we read in our newspapers .

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
why don &apos;t I tell you here at this T@@ ED@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward Said , the man who has shown us how wars are led and people by creating the &quot; other &quot; in public presentation , four decades ago Scientific of Stan@@ ford was .
we have to do un@@ comfortable questions according to the role of its , consciously and un@@ consciously living the &quot; other &quot; ; as it is my girlfriend and I present in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the employment is that we have no president , the chocolate cake , while already ch@@ ut@@ te countries and &quot; to other made &quot; people are bom@@ bed , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
the initiative of stor@@ yt@@ ale wants to preserve urban diversity
stor@@ yt@@ eller count , by Flick@@ r user Daniele Rossi , under the use of the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility , here and now , despite a language barrier with someone in connection ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the creator of stories in their original language is a possible response .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the Un@@ translated blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not written on the written word , but on the spoken word . it concerns a try to obtain the language variety of great cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land , in the United States , where T@@ LS has already conducted events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages does not exist to the children born there .
for the cre@@ ators of the project is :
the mass mortality of the world can be avoided , if we create cities , accept diversity - secure rooms , in which inhabitants don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen often often to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead of listening to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to feel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers represent their story first in their own language and translate or explain to English .
even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their dev@@ otion and their representation make sure the listen@@ er makes it possible .
they call laughter and emotions as the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou con@@ uses the opportunity to explain the story of typical customs of stor@@ yt@@ elling .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the be@@ ak of the rab@@ bit and the po@@ avi@@ an in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after expl@@ aining the meaning of his be@@ ak , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to a audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in@@ sen he shares his feeling of included :
you &apos;ve listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling have taken place in three cities , and the organis@@ ers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project , can organise with T@@ LS in order to organize their own history events .
Puerto Rico calls for the US revival of sovereign debt
with the aim of a new audit in Puerto Rico , which has risen to 72 million US dollars , on the past 3rd April 2017 , various religious and bourgeois organisations involved in a mass demonstration ; the march was launched at the pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ fic Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went down to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the Old Town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civil front for the neur@@ ot@@ ation of debts ) and the O@@ kom@@ en@@ ian church of Puerto R@@ os .
the interc@@ ession of the re@@ petition of the new debts also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto R@@ os calls for politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies who have been responsible for debt for their corruption .
we call for financial inspection and a tap committee without personal interests on public debt , with a firm , our working conditions , re@@ mun@@ eration that is active in favor of the economy .
we will be pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto R@@ os ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not their .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be found with sin@@ c@@ ous retirement payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not integrated in the national territory of the United States - suffers from a heavy financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization , without affili@@ ation with focus on the soci@@ o @-@ economic development , a law gover@@ ning government responsibility as an alternative to the existing state recognition .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto R@@ os requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
on the outside , measures are imposed without the participation and conviction of the citizens of danger , rejected by the people .
the demonstration carried the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :
demonstr@@ ators prepare for the march .

the sy@@ ri@@ cally Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi is missed since over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives filed the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions which he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : PU@@ BL@@ ICA , the annual conference on digital culture that will be held in Berlin , devoted an event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the German @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara Rü@@ hl@@ ing , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; , has produced excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ ner ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective research ) .
the book that has been published last year and is licensed here , contains a number of approaches to deal with the free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it says :
this book wants to discuss , such as movements for free knowledge , and what are the real cost , with which this is linked .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and writers who have involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked on side to view over the fog that surro@@ unds our new@@ s@@ feeds and to create something from our different experience .
this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was kn@@ itted from the Ad@@ ra prison directory , in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about its present state or position .
the introduc@@ tory section of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom , and instantly .
to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us begin to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we decide for ?
what did we give up extreme beliefs in this process ?
the web developer of Open Source and Digital activ@@ ites has been in custody for Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the Ad@@ ra prison , a non @-@ military establishment , to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the military police Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the Military Tribunal in Ad@@ ra .
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she was contacted by persons on November 12 , 2015 , who presented themselves as the Insider of the Assad government and put them by an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his residence and condition continues to remain unknown .
a pioneer in Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a decisive role in implementing access to the Internet and to the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist , and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that Bass@@ el established , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of the bass @-@ cultural prototypes was perhaps more excited than the work which he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the way@@ side of many civi@@ liz@@ ations and the Greek @-@ Roman architectural types with local traditions and Persian influences .
Bass@@ el was not able to know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS would put everything to it , this architecture that is not only em@@ bodied by the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this strike in the digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a tim@@ capsule , which will be inv@@ al@@ u@@ able for the public as well as scientists and artists in the future .
trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el could not stop this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life with it , dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was in jail .
I have learned to read and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he taught other imprisoned , to write and speak English .
Bass@@ el has opened me the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other imprisoned men , as they use computers , at least in theory , without having actually held one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Warten auf ) , a pro@@ filing that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was in jail .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together for a year together in the book .
she ding@@ y the lyrics to him , when she visited him , and he translated it from the Arabic into English .
the book is licensed free .

the book is dedicated to public domain .
here an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :
it happens at every visit ,
that in the world I sink in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes ,
that I lose the sp@@ inning in the moment , in which we embrace us ,
that every creature doesn &apos;t care for me ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es , and watch@@ men
I forget the prison sentence
and I penet@@ rate into every detail of your voice and words .
which I carry with passion for myself ,
when your eyes say goodbye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return soon to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to get all the moments ,
and about your absence to weep and to smile .
I bear witness to myself , that I will return soon ...

Bass@@ els story is not unique in Syria .
since the protests in 2011 against the regime &apos;s Bashar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian National Human Rights ) , more than 6@@ 5.000 people disappeared .
those who were arrested or arrested by violence through the regime were tortured or executed .
until 2016 , Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in detention since 2011 .
the stories of many other people are unknown .
since 2012 the Global Vo@@ ices Community requests the release of Bass@@ el .
today , we repeat our demand for the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambi@@ k : convicted of corruption on arrest due to corruption
at the end of his sentence , Mozambique responded to a corruption incident in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state machine , on which corruption was committed .
this deals with Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 , together with four other def@@ endants , were sentenced to 22 years in prison for failure to be sentenced to 22 years in prison .
the money came from public money at the airports of Mozambique , whose advice was Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately requested his re @-@ setting to the company , which happened on 19 April .
in accordance with a position of the General Prosecutor &apos;s At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , it would not be an obstac@@ le reason for Cam@@ b@@ aza to reg@@ ain his old position as the company had not moved into custody after his incar@@ cer@@ ation .
however , many citizens do not have the action good .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , just C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned in an interview with the German Wave , the decision of the company to address the director :
represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a back@@ step in terms of the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP .
what we have to know is that the company should have a discipl@@ in@@ arian procedure against the assur@@ ances .
the company appears to be silent , however , and promp@@ ted no appropriate legal steps to the application of the appropriate functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , re@@ jects this behavior as well as to be &quot; contra@@ sting &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent type , he would be an advisor after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had served .
he could hold paid speeches and motiv@@ ating speeches , he might advise and pol@@ ishing his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company which he helped to inf@@ lic@@ t damage .
consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will gladly pay for his silence .
contra@@ dic@@ ally !

Facebook is blocking the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users .
the bur@@ ial word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chick@@ peas or spher@@ es .

according to data from Facebook users in Myanmar , the known Social Network took their links out of the net because they contained the word &quot; Kal@@ ar . &quot;
although more about the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is normally used to reject people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ jective &quot; Indian . &quot;
Facebook cen@@ sored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or tu@@ b@@ bing the tu@@ b@@ ings ( in bur@@ ial script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread issue of hate @-@ language in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the A@@ scen@@ sion has been radic@@ ally nation@@ alist movements to the word an extremely complete con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as Hass@@ am against Muslims , who constitute a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight it in Myanmar in Myanmar , the company used a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may usually be associated with rac@@ ism today , but the word itself is not automatically called Hass@@ elt .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also Po@@ sts in which they have discussed the use of the Word or have doubts about his use , cen@@ sored .
furthermore , there are several bur@@ ial words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spi@@ res ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; cal@@ c@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ user A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of my friends was deleted today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends on a spiritual way whether they could have kissed his back pain , as he did a word game .
the Set ku la - &quot; He@@ aling &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ ats is the opinion that it should be more radic@@ ally more radic@@ ally nation@@ alists , but also emphas@@ ised that Facebook needs to be analy@@ tic before it del@@ etes all trop@@ hi@@ es to spread rac@@ ism .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it automatically filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you are writing on Facebook .
what to do instead is to analyse the mail carefully and control it by checking the next words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spher@@ es ) .
the good is that these tri@@ ck@@ ly nation@@ alists who distribute hate @-@ language , receive a pretty good lesson .
now it &apos;s time to circum@@ cise their nation@@ alism .
while the action is sending a strong signal to all that hate them , the efficiency of this strategy may not keep long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ orship of striking words often get a cat@@ ching and mouse game , with the user of social networks simply start to use a new word or an alternative writing of the cen@@ sored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how fac@@ ebook started to delete his post when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned by the social network :
... when I was aware of this new directive on Facebook , I made a post office to join my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
ir@@ on@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to sign posts and sharing of content for 24 hours , because the post office &quot; didn &apos;t dis@@ ap@@ point the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has a wide variety of people removed from people who have no negative inten@@ tions , or just try to show their opinions against the hate radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with Hass@@ elt :
post without hate speech from Facebook is removed .
in the post office the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes Facebook should have done more before the initiative of the initiative , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work .
such words can be cen@@ sored only more hatred within the different communities .
in addition , it appears as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned words like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; peas cur@@ ry . &quot;
even when they found out they made mistakes , they did not attempt to rec@@ ti@@ fy the wron@@ g@@ ally .
if only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits , they claim to be a great turnover , that would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ orship has provided a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of Hass@@ language to see if their links are taken from the web .
here you can see some screen@@ shots from Facebook @-@ Po@@ sts , which have no Hass@@ language , but still removed :

&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; If you &apos;re a doctor , do you cure people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks have increased to extend their voices and their influence .
among other things , an ad@@ diction in social networks can also pre@@ heat the violence in the con@@ greg@@ ations in Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine area where thousands of Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to talk to his bur@@ ial sites on his bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
but rather than to shift the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look rather in context than on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago will conclude with the children &apos;s day@@ time
a wedding ring in sand .

the children &apos;s love is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously adopted a law which is to offer this practice , so that the appropriate age is 18 .
before this change of the adul@@ terer held several members of du@@ istic and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj said that the state should not inter@@ fere with the inter@@ religious groups of the country , that the state should not inter@@ fere with the age that does not determine the maturity . &quot;
this happened , regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contrac@@ ting partner of the UN children &apos;s rights , the min@@ ors as , to every man under the age of 18 .
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who have already been married to 15 , Trinidad and Tobago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical system confirmed that of 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 .
online peti@@ tioning and social media movements which endeav@@ ours to abol@@ ish laws on children &apos;s before , followed at the foot and rejo@@ iced in great support . undoubtedly helped them to bring this outcome .
nevertheless , nothing went smoothly .
a Hindu leaders , for example , had no concerns to say the critics of the children &apos;s love , they should be condemned to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition for@@ ged tension in this really complicated matter , and sometime came to doubt whether the opposition would agree to the bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 the bill was voted against the children &apos;s before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent that could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the president of the country must agree and proc@@ laim the law .
one of the country &apos;s stations gave a status update on Facebook which has re @-@ read Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle at Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill of draft law was voted on the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and not only .
after having previously decided in the Senate , the draft may now become a law .
the majority of the social media user was thrilled , because the laws have finally been changed to children &apos;s love .
dear Francis , a member of the ministry of office in the Ministry of Education , said :
it &apos;s all too much time and unnecessary od@@ or needed , which has polluted the core of the matter but do you know what ? the children &apos;s love is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now is worth every price .
while Abel Jackson was the opinion that it was definitely enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was happy that the day finally arrived :
public Update status on Facebook from L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : News , Excell@@ ent News !
the marriage law has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society , which was quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was noted :
the appropriate age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft on the change of the marriage network today , on June 9 , 2017 , decided .
in the House of Represent@@ atives , there are 41 members in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present in the vote .
all the members who were against have agreed to the law .
the children &apos;s love is legally allowed in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ age@@ fish .

congratulations .
a Thank you to our M@@ EPs .
but a possible hook is in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , therefore , the Secretary @-@ General of San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hindu organization of the country .
prior to months , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to resolve his promise now .
during the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris , Al @-@ wi , a dis@@ advoc@@ ate of the law , said it was wrong if Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , the most social media users were desi@@ rable to address the debate on the subject .
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
dear Sat , if we are taking place to talk about the debate so general , in a way that we would like to invite the state into our bedroom , &quot; just to protect themselves , that the state , our daughters , may protect them from large , hard @-@ infected men who are mis@@ used to them , would you be willing to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the child is legal or even the norm , though there are laws prohi@@ bit@@ ing them .

on Sunday afternoon , the Office of the local news service Y@@ ar@@ News announced that they were h@@ acked .
through the spi@@ der of websites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again
the English @-@ speaking Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , on the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA copyright legislation in the United States , internationally .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month , Turkey has closed the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia .
day for day is clear how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information .
both students and rep@@ orters and fans of TV series resist the lock .
although many techniques used to use Internet users to use blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence of the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users are not falling in this category .
although Turkey has closed articles from Wikipedia since 2008 , just as recently published in an published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University has been reported to find regular block@@ ages of the Internet since 2007 , after the Internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ orship on Wikipedia .
while the platform remains closed , there are now several mirrors ( pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are often being updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform was based on all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator calcul@@ ator ) , which is not based on the system of domain names , thus making a complete c@@ ens@@ orship difficult .
however , the content is available despite a legislative prohibition .
in a blog post IP@@ FS report on his efforts :
after we have heard the messages ( via the locking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything to locate snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read content on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed fashion .
this allows users to help at least all Wikipedia content even if they can &apos;t reach the site www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.org yourself .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was performed independently from the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to avoid the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pe@@ dic@@ .org , a Mir@@ r@@ or@@ side of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to ho@@ ist similar Mir@@ r@@ or@@ sites when it is locked out in the country Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices as well as staff at Mozilla in Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror .
access to another URL , which is not the original thing . that what one sees then is from Wikipedia .
essentially the server direc@@ ts the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia for yourself if they are locked in Turkey .
for this is done by a server , which is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese Wild@@ animal photographer uses his camera to make attention to the need for nature conservation .
a great rhin@@ o , Ch@@ it@@ wan .

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos he saw around , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with po@@ or@@ ly positioned motives and balanced colors .
the motivated him have a camera to wear and try to bury the situation .
back then he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , Nept@@ une stri@@ ves to bring to the international stage .
and his home village next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that direct attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described Facebook how to help him this top @-@ class location in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world heritage . what could there be better for a passionate game photographer ! !
I rested not at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the Manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that a Leopard would be on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river D@@ am is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes there .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other river , where the Leopard was located and I immediately started to kne@@ ad images ! !
Sag@@ ar is seeking a collaboration with the authorities to achieve the worldwide recognition of Nep@@ als Nature and would like to deep@@ ening the understanding that wild animals are not so frigh@@ tening as they look like .
and he should know it , because he stood at the presence of face toward the presence :
tiger can not distur@@ b oneself from the opinion of sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
I was also because of the dark on the way home , when suddenly the King of the Bu@@ he@@ ke appeared . he immediately turns away , we look forward and he star@@ ed me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) to his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and lived in a tent in order to take pictures of Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger , and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near tourist information .
see below some of these photos .

years after the wedding , Indian women for the first time to address their husbands &apos;s name
women in the small Indian village of Gum@@ la Jam Gay@@ i in J@@ har@@ k@@ hand .

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ ov@@ a and was originally published on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organisation from India .
a revised version has been published here as part of a content @-@ sharing Convention .
in many parts of India , women avoid women with great care , to address the name of their husbands or even older men in the family .
instead , they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h women admit that they should respect the husband due to the social pressure of the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences , they should im@@ itate the norm to maintain this practice .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned by the Indian state of O@@ ther@@ a by a p@@ seu@@ dost@@ em and exp@@ el by their family and the village community after she had addressed a dedicated relations with names .
the tradition of tradition not call their wives by name is also spread among men . however , they have far fewer assign@@ ments to fear , if ever , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including healthcare personnel and house@@ wives , became a unique club and thus became fast to the main themes of the city .
it is a place for them alone , to discuss and discuss the qualities of patri@@ arch@@ ism .
as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states it is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , operated by the community video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and sets itself for the removal of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was working for seven years with the help of their video camera to the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s home to the association of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and leads these clubs .
she reports about how these clubs were created a safe place for these women and made them at the same time as the shaft inside of the wall .
the first video , which showed Roh@@ ini in its discussion round , acted by women who don &apos;t call their husbands at the name .
she decided on this issue because she wanted to open the talk about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
not to pron@@ ounce the names of their husbands , a Br@@ ine , which they are all condemned to agree , and never questioned him .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition tells us that a woman respects her husband and wishes to give him a long life .
a woman who doesn &apos;t hold this , is regarded as a post@@ pon@@ ent , as a woman without mor@@ ality .
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we have never made thought about this discussion round .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who never had called her husband , had never known her husband at home , as it runs at home .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother in law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband were silent for a long time , after the video was finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him by name now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini started with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , were protected .
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after video projection , the women tried to bring discussion with a exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , anno@@ ys , sad , loving and so on .
then she asked them all , &quot; If we cannot say the name of our husbands , but they can call us as they want us , means that they don &apos;t respect us ?
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day that they brought the name of their husbands on the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was of the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women would never be able to pron@@ ounce their husbands &quot; name .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise just stood up , another one decided to release the whole fru@@ stration against him and to release his family by cursed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
nor in ad@@ renal@@ ine f@@ ren@@ ders , to have broken with an ancient tor@@ so , the women decided that they could actually try home their husbands in their name .
and they kept their word .
in the next days Roh@@ ini received a lot of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put in the head : his wife could not stop to say his name .
another club member decided to do it dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law @-@ law hi@@ ked them , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
the husband of an attendance was less understand@@ able and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as the carrying of the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point on the forehead that shows the marriage status :
why do women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would carry the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point if he would do it .
he laugh@@ ed only , and I listened to him to carry him .
the other women have not finished completely , but mean they are now in a better position , even to choose to wear it in some days .
for many women the Disc@@ ussion lu@@ b is a safer place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do a trip at every discussion ver@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we packed lunch and water and go out into the field .
I don &apos;t want to take care of those who could hear , &quot; she says .
in the last months she celebrated her own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in her life . they danced and talked about things about which they never had thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have been thinking about some things , for example , like our identi@@ ties to our husbands , have never been so honest .
it feels great to be able to tell certain things lou@@ dly , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round we have maintained about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have only worn Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most of them is okay , but some wanted to bear a Sal@@ was @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a tro@@ users , they did not have a we@@ eds .
after many dispute and discussion on the advantages of their own coat @-@ choice , mor@@ als linked with the Sar@@ is and much more , ding@@ g@@ gel@@ ded Roh@@ ini their own pair of cour@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion round , so that the women could bear them .
next , they now have decided to plan an excursion to Go@@ a in which they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will create it .
on the question , if in the five months have changed a bit , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are slowly getting into the rolling :
we only have taken little steps so far .
some women try a few times , but then they stopped to say the name of her husband .
some , including myself , make it still , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there .
only one or two will continue to say the name of their husbands ; only one or two women can now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
the women in Disc@@ ussion lu@@ b know that the changes they would like to achieve in their lives - like the F@@ eil@@ les for more motion freedom or their own coat @-@ choice - at the end of a hard to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also there .
but this club gives everyone the confidence that something will change .

the Beatles visit in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a down@@ turn in the Japanese culture of post @-@ war years .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who interviewed the Beatles in London in 1964 , noted on the 50th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days the Beatles were in the country , but this has been enough to turn the Japanese .
the people here is quite quickly clear that they had no other choice when the Beatles have received open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached its zen@@ ith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ i@@ chi Is@@ aka , President of the retail price of Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! ! today the Beatles of the Beatles began in Japan . an average of 51 years ago they were here in Tokyo .
even today , songs from the Beatles have sung in Japanese karaoke bars and in English lessons at Japanese middle schools .
the put@@ sch of the Beatles survived everything .
today The Beatles @-@ memorial day is .
we all love in our house the Beatles .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; pupp@@ et John Lenn@@ on should be present or not .
and as it belongs to fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ m@@ ages to the well @-@ known places that are related to the band .
b@@ lows - If you love the Beatles , you are the 5 places you need to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( memorial in New York )
4 ) Penn@@ y Lane
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beatles Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
sometimes the pilgri@@ m@@ ages can &apos;t be quir@@ ky enough :
good morning along .
today The Beatles @-@ memorial day is .
exactly today in 1966 , the Beatles began the first time in Japan .
the characters from the K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across the Abbey Road .
the same thing we did last year too .
and of course some companies use the fan@@ base also market engineering , such as this R@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese pasta ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! - Today &apos;s The Beatles of The Beatles .
and what could that be for a day ?
today I will listen to me today &quot; Y@@ ah &quot; and eat R@@ amen noodles with Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya .

strong men are killed and killed in Mozambique
the police at Zam@@ be@@ é@@ zia warned the people that believing men could be a target of attacks in Mozambique .

a new system for the kidn@@ apping of fine @-@ strong persons for organic trade , presumably for super@@ sti@@ cking purposes , wor@@ ries the police of Zam@@ be@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a number of operations into life to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims were de@@ capit@@ ated , and some of the organs were taken from .
two men were arrested and subsequently given that the organs of Sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi have been used .
there is a local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a fine of a man &apos;s gold can be enth@@ r@@ alled or wealth , the police Officer of Zam@@ be@@ é@@ zia of the BBC declared .
it is the first time that successive attacks on glorious men were registered in Mozambique .
another group , the aim of assass@@ inations for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 passed a mission in SA to investigate these practices .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight these super@@ sti@@ tions and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya dw@@ ells in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who wanted to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travels to Mozambique are aiming ritual attacks , warned the Muslim police according to the latest murdered victims of three @-@ strong men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the murdered victims were arrested .
Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Ad@@ amo , student and residents of the city of In@@ ham@@ let in the south of Mozambique said that the local police have already occurred in the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the gl@@ ary men .
the persecution and murder of fine @-@ member individuals for the extraction and selling of their organs in Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a province , for presumably the Muslim ritu@@ als and is given by the traditional sham@@ ans , this also publishes a belief in the Republic of Mozambique , according to which the victims had power in his head , the wealth of wealth .
in the last days three men were killed with hair fail@@ ures in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the B@@ log@@ gers Armen Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who pointed out that the problem is part of the bigger social difficulty that Mozambique has faced :
I would like GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambi@@ k , TH@@ AT S@@ ICH would be ashamed to claim sex against good notes , work and other achievements , a nation in which the people would not hurt or even their lives to make their bread , a country in which the al@@ bin@@ os still k@@ ah@@ le or &quot; black magic &quot; are hun@@ ted to aim to achieve a rapid wealth .
despite the emergence of the phenomenon , some of the opportunity for mak@@ ab@@ ren humor could not miss .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter sp@@ ore , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the boss of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange , as well as the police pre@@ qui@@ ver Zam@@ be@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , both of them are blessed :
Muslim authorities are very worried about the murdered victims of gl@@ it@@ orial people .

we are deeply involved , to experience the death of our friend Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il .
we mo@@ urn for him , and speak our deep felt con@@ dol@@ ences against his family , his friends , and all those who knew him , and loved him .
a pioneer of creative com@@ mons in Syria , actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) took a key role in it to open the public access to the internet and open knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices @-@ Community and took part in our Arabian B@@ logger meeting in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bass@@ el &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she had contacted by persons , who , himself as the Insider of the Assad government .
they reported that their husband was condemned to death , but gave no further information .
Bass@@ el &apos;s stay and Constitution were unknown until today ( 01 . August 2017 ) , as N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials heard that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in future , we prove the glory of Bass@@ el as a pioneer of the open web movement .
and we acknowledge the efforts of all the people and organisations that have set up for his release in the last five years .
since 2011 and the protests against the regime of Bashar al @-@ Assad , more than 6@@ 5.000 people disappeared , such as the Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested by the regime , were tortured or abandoned by the regime , torture and even exec@@ utions are exposed .
between 2011 and 2016 , less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have come to death , so the international human rights organization Am@@ nesty International .
the fate of many people more remains unknown .

a photo of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Liu X@@ ia , probably recently made .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of prison@@ ed Chinese dis@@ sidents Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o had caught attention in the international community , after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he was hosp@@ itali@@ zed for liver cancer in the terminal stage .
in 2009 , Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( State Investig@@ ation ) , after referring to the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that the democratic reforms in China had requested .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the State Department in China referred to Li@@ us Fall as &quot; an internal matter &quot; and nar@@ rated a speaker , he considered it as &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
however , China will continue to call calls from the international community , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet , Liu X@@ ia , or to allow him a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely pronounced on the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ med up some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss Liu &apos;s case .
however , a speaker refused to comment , whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to enable Liu abroad a treatment .
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Bren@@ de refused to answer questions about Li@@ us .
the relationship between China and Norway was moved to the Sto@@ cks , after the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu , although the Norwegian government settled there was nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . in June Norway , Norway signed an agreement to reg@@ ain salmon committees since 2010 , because the exports had been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope for a conditional release and called Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his detention , he was not able to opp@@ ose his award .
during the ceremony , Liu was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a decision to liber@@ ate Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants .
the peak of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of China for the release of Li@@ us as announced on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect to raise all limitations of Mr Li@@ us &apos;s wife as well as family members .
they should meet and receive all the visits , which they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
U.S. ambassador Terry Bran@@ stad told that Americans knew him that he has the possibility to treat abroad , as if it is possible to help him . &quot;
an spokesperson for the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AFP on June 27 that the message would release the Chinese authorities , not only Liu , but also his wife Ms. Liu X@@ ia from their house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the request of the US embassy drew a ra@@ ging response from China to themselves , with the utter@@ ance of the State Department that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to participate in and un@@ answer comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the married couple :
protection and freedom , including travel access and access to the medical care of its choice , which they have according to Chinese constitution and legal system and international comm@@ itments .
the U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to imp@@ ose Liu and his wife un@@ conditional .
I urge China to release the Nobel Lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ conditional , so that he can carry himself in a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin that Liu explains all the medical support he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping was published on July 7 and 8th at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing reported that China had huge concerns whether the turbul@@ ence could o@@ vers@@ aw the visit in Hamburg .
Canada
on 28 June , the Canadian ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um invited China to provide a reasonable medical care and give him the opportunity to provide himself from his family .
Li@@ us lawyer told AFP that Li@@ us wife , Liu X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed to talk to anyone including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells about :
Canada calls on China to maintain its international human rights violations , including freedom of expression , and for exercising these rights prohibited .
France
on 29 June , the Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs called for China on 29 June to release Liu from humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o will receive all treatments that he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family may contact him .
although the news conference on France has already reported that the French government of Liu was welcome in the country , the State Department announced that France could not find any further information if France would eventually receive him .
Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Crime &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Taiwan on June 27th , China called on Liu &apos;s free tolerance to set a greater tolerance towards those who demand peaceful funds to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ature from the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself in a statement on June 28 around Liu very concerned and asked that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well@@ being .
he said about Liu :
it is my faith that the initiatives he took , and for whom he had been strictly punished , led to a harmon@@ ious , stable , and weal@@ thy China , which in turn had contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt personally moved and encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed the Charter 08 who stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or countryside ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Singapore should be regarded as a city .
this remark has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
during the meeting on occasion of the meeting of the international branch of the law of the State of New York , the Minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , because they are compared to Singapore with other countries .
it supports that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one has asked whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people get a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are no country .
the blog of Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; rejected the logic &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this valuable land , you can say that we could not be any country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the certificate of a flight before the responsibilities , a mandatory injury .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very noble : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal lands &apos; , in view of its , he appeared inev@@ it@@ ably un@@ democratic .
however , by contrast , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core point of the subject , the good old surro@@ unds of the Auth@@ ors Mach@@ ines will be resur@@ rec@@ ted by the author@@ itative figures , leaving the Democrats , where it fits better to their power .
in the end the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am gave answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judicial authorities , our political system really non @-@ answers .
he tar@@ ried appropriate questions with non @-@ Ans@@ wers .
Rachel Z@@ eng asks Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am to demonstrate his mind , as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
when Singapore is not a country but a city is , so to which country our city belongs to ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very thank@@ ful if our wer@@ ter K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take the effort to clari@@ fy this point where it was paid up to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore .
by taking on his comment on the blog , he points out his comment on the critics that you should start to read the entire recording of the conference , so that one can understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am better , according to that Singapore is a city and no country .
read the script .
when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; city &quot; as a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore were so un@@ important , even if we are looking forward to free and fair elections .
he moved to Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities were watching a party for decades ? ) .
when he said , Singapore was no country , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense !
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , who , as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am talking about what the Minister of Justice has said of Singapore , I am very promising ...
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Guard , which I expected - would I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even certain whether he really believes that he really believes that he defended .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review sets the vulner@@ abilities of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; ben@@ ign an error , &quot; or was it a free speaker ?
when Singapore is not a country , we are considered independent and sovereign state ?
if not , on which country go back the sovereign rights of the city to Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it &apos;s equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the government statement , the testimony of Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am are of severe importance .
why are the people of Singapur of their military service , do they defend their city but not their country ?
who has to pay our Prime Minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country , or inhabitants of a city ?
to the publication of the Journey of a Dec@@ ade for affir@@ mation , Singapore is and always a city :
&quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot;
this proposition seems to have anno@@ yed a lot of Singapur ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island nation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defence of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather talk about the defence of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked for his editors : what is the most ab@@ duc@@ ted aspect of your home or homeland ?
their answers will be published here as part of a continued series , with the rum@@ ours of certain parts of the world , and another fac@@ ets will be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thompson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question I am most asked in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on what situation takes place , it is considered polite to show interest in its talk partner by making personal questions .
then in my clari@@ fication follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , Nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans are perhaps in@@ war@@ dly especially anger if they are held for Americans , but does not distur@@ b me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little to distinguish us Canadi@@ ans of Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans spend a Canadian flag in their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
by contrast , Americans are ... .
so it was , when I began 20 years ago , through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always worn little map@@ le blades in their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free healthcare !
there are no weapons with us !
gay marriage are legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are polite .
we obviously say very often &quot; ap@@ ology . &quot;
Canada is also considered to be the toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends I admire very much .
it would make me nothing , if you were changing me from Dallas , for example .
with Marc out of Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
firstly , as &quot; nice &quot; signi@@ fies , in essence , to be sp@@ un - as the good@@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but trag@@ ically , un@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has one &apos;s own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) .
if Canada really had a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , this would be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing at which one can encounter .
to be harmless , un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive , and not to earn attention .
this can be something good , if you go un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that pass around .
I would even go as far as to say that the desire , free and to be alone , is the main character of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what outside as &quot; nice , &quot; is perhaps just cool pol@@ iten@@ ess .
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t talk about the fence about the fence .
we l@@ acks the warm hear@@ ty , open kindness , which I now connect with my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Justin Tru@@ de@@ au considered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our Prime Minister has almost made Canada .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ ert Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop @-@ band has released a music video that seized the Jun@@ ta in 2014 and restore power in spite of its promises to restore the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the Tattoo Colour is describing a young man who tells of that his girlfriend makes his girlfriend .
although not politically , the music video refers to the continued military power of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage , to describe the situation in the country .
the video for song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video was posted on Facebook highly charged video 1.@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; Der dictator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists united the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in@@ special , as it is the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
check out these recordings of the videos that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand have pursued in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; possibly refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution which is granted the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the military absolute decision on important national topics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; installation change &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered a critic of the Jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was also set up in the army which monitors online content and persons accused of having s@@ lan@@ dered the monarchy , prosec@@ ute the criminal law .
Thailand sets a strict companion against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the war was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the jun@@ ta continues to buy , is their decision to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of control systems .
in the video it will even show how people are thrown into a black delivery van before being put into an intermediate camp , another problem .
some journalists are sitting in prison , because they allegedly causing the &quot; confusion &quot; in society and threat@@ ens Internet users to pen@@ se long sentences , they should ins@@ ult the monarchy .
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the band members , which was used by Sal@@ ut , &quot; The tribute of Pan@@ em , &quot; who had already been used by put@@ sch opponents during protests in 2014 .

the post @-@ war company is very slowly re@@ covering in East @-@ Ab@@ c@@ asia , especially in the T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al district .
it has now been over 20 years since the Georgian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ al war officially ended , but his s@@ cars are still visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of northern districts in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show mark@@ edly images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asien .
various ethnic groups like Russians , Greeks , par@@ asi@@ es , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked as Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , the largest part of Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ ases live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost cities in Ab@@ ch@@ asien .
in the pre @-@ war period there were still more than 10,000 people , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost cities .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district of 16.000 people , after having barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 , about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

at the entrance to the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , I met a local older man .
he starts a conversation and it is hard to end this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I speak to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why speak ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of war , the village was full of life .
there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ g@@ art@@ ens , which served all of the community .
now there are only paved road with amazing spl@@ end@@ or buildings .
people who once lived on this place and their contribution to the central plan@@ ation of the Soviet Union , have now left the district .
about fifty inhabitants live in the Gei@@ ster@@ stadt D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the chron@@ icles , which still houses one or two families , can be seen in the balconies where the laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discovered me with the camera in the hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; our mother for@@ b@@ ade us to let us take pictures , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she just forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers to her girlfriend and suddenly leave the destroyed buildings and van@@ ish .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the Sub@@ si@@ sten@@ c@@ wirtschaft ( cultivation of land@@ scap@@ ing products for their own needs ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
in winter , the district administration provides for free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini &quot;
some ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or aun@@ t G@@ alya , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her eldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina didn &apos;t leave before demo@@ lition to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain in Ab@@ ch@@ asien &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sted that she is instead supported her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly R@@ ente has just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ alya tells that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate Christmas .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
if holidays are , let &apos;s visit us .
but we can &apos;t do that constantly - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calls for aun@@ t G@@ alya her . &quot; they said we could build cour@@ g@@ ettes .
I already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as talk party Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children living in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they remembered the village &apos;s fle@@ es before the war .
despite the relative that lives in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ asi@@ es broke away ) , they had no chance to leave the opportunity .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ ch@@ asien ) .
we want to build a house there , but that will last still something , &quot; she explains re@@ thinking .
Nat@@ ascha is getting around $ 9 for each child .
her husband works in the Kohl@@ eng@@ ru@@ be .
the young family has its own farm .
close to the house where Nat@@ ash@@ as kinder@@ garten once lived , they keep pigs , cows , rabbits and chickens .
they told that there was a very anxi@@ ous situation as many people left the village after the war .
but during the time , she lost her anxi@@ ousness .

&quot; we don &apos;t be afraid of the dark street or the few people .
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and everyone lived like it was right .
I remember every day , as the city and the war were once . &quot;
as our conversation joins the end , a little boy goes over to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball is flying out of the window and another boy hun@@ ts him back .
he plays with the ball , who then scra@@ pped the hill .
a group of children are now scre@@ aming the ball .
while they run , some of them cast stones to the falling building .
these ruins are a part of their childhood , who ensure uncertainty in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it differently .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants in their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez conduc@@ ts a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our Partners PR@@ I.@@ org and is published here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , some places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city centre .
it is led by a 59@@ - year old Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ erin , a small woman with a coral pink Bri@@ ll@@ en@@ frame and gold @-@ colored earrings in ted@@ dy form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . yet they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it is ) become a target for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians that are on transit .
the hotel doesn &apos;t have any charm .
for approximately 2.@@ 50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bled walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom , there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants coming here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells us , people come into full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call : &quot; m@@ um Africa !
where are you in Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it &apos;s more quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside on board .
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anyone .
she helps them , and bring them to the hospital if they are ill , they buy them medications that they could not pay , they massage them with a bal@@ sam that drew from the long voyage .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived at a short time ago .
I asked him if Mama Africa was a fair nickname for Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ ly ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hoping to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel that it suits her , since African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very lov@@ ingly .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , hoping to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have been living in Brazil , however , it is for some Afri@@ cans , who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north .
the family had heard from other directions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel the way together and that Afri@@ cans already speak on What@@ s@@ App of Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
as many of his companions , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil and worked as a construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the soccer world championships .
when the Brazilian economy was we@@ aker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been guest in M@@ om Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mom Africa is our mother and we never leave them again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in contact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that her guests are often sending text messages when they continued to greet them or to report her about the course of their journey .
she explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa but their guests have taught them to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spar@@ king hope for migrants who are travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the town , a cu@@ l @-@ sa@@ c leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ ela .
in this winter , Valen@@ ela and his family are taken in their small house .
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants can be sold too expensive .
he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on blank@@ ets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests go through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was referred to as a raid on his work place from the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he had fled in Honduras with his wife and three children in front of people who wanted money , without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , one of the stone , offered it to his roof .
a few months later , the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa , everything is full of guests .
in the lengths the trav@@ ellers depend on their phones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has 20 new guests , a majority of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but it is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone out .
like a proud grandmother , she bl@@ ends her album with numerous photos .
one of her daughter is with African hair spots that you made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sorry , while she introduces them short .
&quot; Ya &quot; fu@@ eron be repeated every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their cell phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication equipment in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang from Twitter users to the tri@@ b@@ ings .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their cell phones .
on 10 July , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a cell message to install a monitoring app named J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; web cleaning &quot; ) .
in the message , the app is said to &quot; keep access to terrorist information . &quot;
however , the authorities also managed to use the app for more than com@@ b@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because they had installed the app shortly after they had installed the app .
in the communication of the police , the app was able to determine the sources and the distribution of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is the block of por@@ no@@ graphic websites , of online fraud , Trojan and ph@@ ishing pages to make users atten@@ tively how much time they spend on online and to control their own home network .
this app with the filters for min@@ ors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these features can be used , of course , in various ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could even steal state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal home network &apos;s home network .
this introduction is consistent with other measures relating to the control of digital activities in this region .
while messages about digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China usually focus on experiencing the experience of users in the east and south , the reality is very often gri@@ ster@@ ous for those who live in distant ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict regions , authorities often arrange extreme ten@@ ds and surveillance measures , as well as rout@@ in@@ em@@ eal Internet ab@@ sten@@ tions .
the media @-@ based media Out@@ let &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( tri@@ b@@ bing th@@ under@@ ings ) , the cen@@ sored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where police reports in@@ discrimin@@ ately , if they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure the people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that the people re@@ install the app within 10 days .
if you &apos;re discovered at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned up to 10 days .
that is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use equipment for older people .
this is a form of captivity by means of w@@ aking technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( b@@ az@@ zy th@@ under@@ ings ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which empha@@ sizes that the software can lift the license requirements of a Windows operating system , so that you get unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and cell phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang are available for electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council Council to minim@@ ize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
all government officials , authorities and party related facilities including universities and research institutions are oblig@@ ated to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security Office when operating their computers and communications equipment .
a current report by Freedom House , a US @-@ American human rights organization , also mentioned this new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , cell phones , external drives , portable HD@@ Ds , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrorist videos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible verses , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which the activist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane signs his experiences in a Syrian jail . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world you look at and specify that you &apos;re alone in one place where everything is missing .
everything has gradually revealed and revealed a truth , which is clearly identi@@ fiable , both from inside and outside .
one that makes their name all honor .
one that has crushed in a list of feelings and expressions , that allow no met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when the reality comes back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the actors , beautiful scenes and perform@@ ers - turn the characters into being of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all doubt solve yourself in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is on the axis of the monster , it becomes clear that you are captured here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone for stone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lesson &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the chief of the security services it form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he set his power over us by teaching even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five young people were killed during a peaceful protest like dar@@ nel we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough to divide the city into the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scre@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all quarters were cov@@ eted , my own not .
for the first time it was quiet , ra@@ ining , at the wrong time , even though I had no high demands on a city that , until the arter@@ ies with state @-@ of state organisms and their ac@@ complic@@ es .
in the third night , things had a cal@@ med down , after listening to the power supply in the fourth quarter .
I broke the silence , by crying out several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice through the silence .
few minutes later some of my friends felt cour@@ ageous enough to meet together .
I wasn &apos;t alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we were al@@ lied to a splendid view that filled my expectations full and full .
in such a moment you are aware that you delivered the Spirit from the lamp , but it just doesn &apos;t interest you anywhere .
I received a call from my father : &quot; make you ready , we meet at the Military Security Building . &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can return to you from your voice to the office of the security service from the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; don &apos;t let me hear how you cry &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am if we are not near . &quot;
his full @-@ filled eyes were on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you dream of what to look at me in the eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did so did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps to the revolution .
I was so sure I answered : &quot; I didn &apos;t think you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I have never stopped to see you in your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret my word what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary and his father with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is equal to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the mis@@ tank of this curse lies to me until today in the nose .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a mental torture that I was suspended for months .
I break through the yard .
in the first office , I leave everything I carry with me .
thereafter again through the yard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I character@@ ize all details exactly before I care in the room .
otherwise , otherwise they have shared a greater cell with me .
I have to share it with only one another prisoner , and let me stop immediately without waiting for her permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I attacked on a proven communication method : to beat the wall against the wall .
I learned that my cell player was a &quot; terrestrial det@@ ain@@ ees . &quot;
he would gladly answer me after a long hes@@ itation .
apparently in any of the surrounding cells , there was a respected man middle age that looks like me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness there is no more distinctive facial features , and doctors are not there ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like me ? &quot;
all answers to one of its existence .
perhaps he was moved into one of the major cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would leave him fre@@ il@@ ful when I stay .
li@@ ars .
I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to distribute all these crow@@ s , which are lab@@ elled on the fruits in the garden of my head lab@@ s .
from the distance I hear them still &quot; all@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ am .
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ ams will be scre@@ aming , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that Black saw the color of corruption , until I saw the yellow light that gave us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( such as &quot; Thunder , &quot; An@@ tig@@ ation on the 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to hear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the secret was ventil@@ ated : to protect the state of state in front of us and prevent the terrorists and terrorists in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect , they played their denom@@ in@@ ational detection card and betra@@ y the close eye field of her world view .
the here is no house , which is no country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to turn the criminals of their cl@@ an into a hero .
I cared for the listening room and meet on Abu I@@ mad , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me so .
he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that do him away : &quot; my young , you are still young , you can do so much of the weight of your life and protest to demonstrations , which will soon be an end anyway . &quot;
I did not answer .
I have used to acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed it , not to answer .
I can really no longer say when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches after a friendly conversation has become a normal communication tool .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to be punished , although I had done nothing to make this penalty .
at punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to plu@@ ck me so much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the loving &quot; confes@@ sion . &quot;
it begins with a plastic pipe , which probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your Hen@@ ker rejo@@ ices at your cry .
give it a pleasure , you cannot measure it with him , and you cannot keep your cry .
my cry were not enough for him , so why they exchanged the tube through a cable .
during my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator had worked as a garbage collector earlier or if it belonged to normal working equipment .
they had blocked four cables in each other , in order to present us from their point of view , great invention of a huge cab@@ ele .
within a single hour three of them changed while still in the line .
I had lost all this feeling in my body - and my voice is why I heard it cry out .
the Hen@@ ker noticed the cooling , and found no pleasure in all that he was the next to a electrically charged rod .
electricity through my whole body , enough to supply my whole quarter .
my semi @-@ naked body , who stretched out on the floor , was the perfect wire leader .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
that must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed , which came to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light meets the space &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
I reply with the voice of an in@@ exhaus@@ tible youth : &quot; my lord , my father must be fear@@ ful wor@@ rying . &quot;
&quot; be silent , and get away , you will be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they were always released .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photograph was taken from aman Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sp@@ ends most of its time indo@@ ors ; sometimes he sm@@ iles at his screen , once to his computer , and again at his couch .
what you can rely on , is a cigarette between his fingers or his nic@@ ot@@ ine lips .
he lives in the top floor of his family house which has been part of them since 1967 ; the year that Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family had forced to escape from their village in Palestine , where she lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( about : farmer ) .
for six years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate active activist , who was transferred to the conservative majority of the conservative majority over gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression through art and rap@@ es@@ hips .
with his music , which is often dealt with topics like orient@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian poultry , he also demands the core of the entire Arab world . all these subjects do not only find relevance in his home town of Amman , but also in cities that stretch from Damascus in Yemen to the whole of San@@ aa in Yemen .
in his 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as someone who is not restricted in his thinking through borders , and can be expressed as a loud statement with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he doesn &apos;t exist openly , he is a special dis@@ agreement against the US @-@ American foreign policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones , anything with its identity as &quot; Palestinian poultry of second generation &quot; - so he describes himself , even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think because of my own life circumstances , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b empha@@ sizes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so because I am a man , while he was dissolved in water . it is the holy month of Ram@@ ad@@ an ; it is the Holy month of Ram@@ ad@@ an ; at that time it is intended for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ ad@@ an .
obviously H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain in@@ ability to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has a little bit of hot j@@ it@@ ag little with protest against Islam .
basically , the beats lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the wa@@ iter of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the free sky , especially when one throws a look into the neighbouring countries .
therefore , one avo@@ ids it easy to do basic things - as in the public during the Ram@@ ad@@ an water - to land not in prison .
recently , the Interior Minister Jord@@ ani@@ ens had cancelled one appearance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila , already for the second time .
some par@@ liament@@ arians who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosex@@ ual fron@@ ts@@ hip Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contra@@ dic@@ ts the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country and is the main reason for the concert statement .
the Euro MP and former press review of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN that the concert was cancelled &quot; just &quot; due to the sexual orientation of the sc@@ andal .
many claim also the commitment of the band in matters such as Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which provides the proven legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regim@@ es in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eila inv@@ aded the Jord@@ anian people as a &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; that still has decided to use a intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement might not be easy to be sil@@ ky rh@@ et@@ oric , but in fact a clear@@ er @-@ cryst@@ alline reality reflects Jordan which clearly appears in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work clearly .
in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b made traditional gender tern@@ ess to body by having made his vision of the fate of Arabic women that have vo@@ iced sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a apparently down@@ worn unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who have actually trusted .
over the past years , the number of &apos; Hon@@ or &apos; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of Hon@@ or in 2016 reached its cli@@ max . however , the institutional infrastructure is missing , however , that Jordan has become institutional infrastructure to support the victims , the victims attempted murder or domestic violence .
according to a law on the inter@@ rup@@ ting control of the year 1954 , women who are exposed to the risk of domestic violence , &quot; in un@@ certain times in prison , &quot; and for their release , often a years of bureaucra@@ tic expendi@@ tures as well as the guarantee on the family is necessary that the woman is nothing to happen .
also H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is known to be back in front of topics that are long as tab@@ oos in his country .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , however , that he is talking about his music , which is full of explic@@ it incen@@ tives on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , cannot separate from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
I was saying to me , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are politically vulnerable within the core .
in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , in which one can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or not believe , H@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he not@@ ices that hardly anyone speaks in Jordan on the rights of gay and les@@ bians , and that comments on equality between LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals still were cen@@ sored in 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b introduced an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian On@@ line@@ age program Ro@@ ya to remember that his comments were torn from the context , twi@@ sted and cen@@ sored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Youtube it was uploaded without cuts , but was merely a working version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance does not dis@@ promise to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ ys , a poet of the eighth century , which still has remained today thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ ys , who was later to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , in the eighth century , he could not write about homosexu@@ ality .
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eila or the fact that the show was canc@@ eled to do .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on the free expression of expression and that progressive voices are being put to silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service took several former government officials and members of the teacher &apos;s association with the grounds that they expressed themselves on comment@@ aries in social media critical to the problems linked to the deep in the country .
in view of this , the H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs concert is just the tip of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to work as structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ anians .
for him is an independent member and take . Jordan has now glori@@ fies M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - it is of slow , need and inner changes . he is sure that these changes take place in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arabs also , from an Arab world without interventions from abroad .
he does not only dream about bringing his work until Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experiencing them . &quot;
perhaps the region is characterized by music , art and literature of a real and fundamental op@@ enness - and not caused by bombs , stre@@ et@@ uni@@ tions and artificial manner . at least he hopes that .
until the time is done , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue , and therefore also resist resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these large , extravag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festivals .
it is believed that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festivals that is usually celebrated in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the drums , the drums and dancing over more than one thousand years , came into the Nor@@ theast , to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi , into the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could grab a couple of great seats , so we got a great view .
you can imagine just how large these parts are ...
a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( liter@@ al ) .
I have been watching the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars are just visible .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only True - and to spend his summer in the summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was here and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ festival .
the view of a 18 @-@ meter high gate was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely were outer appearance and body care so important as in this story , because they help maintain the Peru@@ vian youth from crime and promote a legitimate profession like the hairdres@@ ser .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important harbor , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic centre of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street smo@@ kes and illegal drug trade are daily .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - increasing demand for men &apos;s aesthetic services .
the trend , the appearance , and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has managed to give more norm@@ alization into the experienced hands of hairdres@@ sers that can recre@@ ate these elabor@@ ate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ style &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there are experts from each other to show who can create the cent@@ rist L@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitors can be seen on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as school Augu@@ sto Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who found himself in El Call@@ ao , find here an opportunity to exchange young people against bar@@ ber tools and instead of bad advice an apprentic@@ eship in hairdres@@ ser &apos;s art that enables them to find work .
motivated by this activity and providing opportunities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops in early March and reported about some of their achievements :
in 1995 we were the only specialist school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because of love to the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : lov@@ ing@@ ress of guer@@ ri@@ llas
photo : Valentina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the revised version of the contribution &quot; love messages on guer@@ ri@@ llas , &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution will be published here in a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not much more important to accommodate people who have been exp@@ elled , aff@@ ection for aff@@ ection ?
this question was exactly the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the Young Youth Foundation and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired her to write the campaign of cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ cili@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) , the young people encouraged to write guer@@ ri@@ sts letters .
first , recently , her country scene was a historical event , and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International was considered to be the signing of the peace agreement as so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
in front of Colombia , however , a long way until you can speak of a real reconciliation and peace .
Guer@@ ri@@ ll@@ ab@@ bers who lived in illegal camps for many years , had been exposed to a rh@@ et@@ oric of war and contributed around the clock their weapons , and then they have to integrate into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to life in permanent fear and in some cases of deep hatred toward guer@@ ri@@ llas , these must now take in their ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that young Colombia had to join together and would have to help the integration process .
and that &apos;s what they did , too : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love messages from former guer@@ ri@@ llas to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ llas - which will then be handed over to personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea of the study was created on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate who took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to speak with Kail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this stated that we love the people who love , on Valentine &apos;s Day of thousands of love letters , but those who need to need much more necessary .
he plan , he continued to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent need .
thus , the plan , letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , which now will find their place in society and will show themselves a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the dis@@ course of a war story about a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
until now , more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Mani@@ z@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought that someone would be forgiven me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region on 19 March at one of the UN camps in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ i@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation to bring the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC put themselves on how they had done it earlier to meet the commands of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of compl@@ aining of people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings can walk through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is in @-@ between , &quot; explains the Political Social @-@ Student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ nez Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Governor &apos;s Board of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
having handed over the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ llas live ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ llas who wrote something .
I was afraid to go on , because next to him on the bed a M@@ GL pom@@ egran@@ ate , a le@@ thal weapon in the thorn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter I wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
never in my life , someone has written something like this , that &apos;s why I answer it . &quot; suddenly the tears suddenly ran on the che@@ eks .
I embra@@ ced him completely , and put me beside the pom@@ egran@@ ate .
perhaps he was sorry for the war , was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion to this fighting , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never expected something different from life than war . the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before the star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my fault .
but now I know that there is a company outside there , waiting for us with open arms .
until now I have learned , how I have to handle weapons .
but now where peace rules , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
for the start , students and some of the F@@ ARC attended a discussion round .
the students were all raised as already war and the F@@ ARC already existed in secret .
therefore the leaders of the F@@ ARC said the history of the organization , its ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we experienced how the social in@@ justice from the State of the entire Colom@@ bian people seemed to develop , we can contribute to a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country .
for a purpose of these mag@@ nit@@ ude it &apos;s worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said .
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
those people have never heard yet , who have never heard yet hearing , and recognise that people who have often seen as monsters and even hate them , even only people with beautiful feelings , which were turned through their lives and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality , in which the country lives , hurt me .
but it comfort me that all men - even those who have done and have done so much harm to us , and give us a smile and a hug .
many former fighters have answered the letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca , wrote the example of Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the City of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
Colombia was made known , that after dis@@ armament peace would reign .
but that is not the case .
as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to take up the weapons and to protest for their rights . and that is also fully justified ( ... ) .
we are now facing peace , on a policy without weapons .
therefore , we call all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter which breed , religion or ide@@ ology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , afford our contribution , and bring sacrifices , because we know from your own experience that nothing is simple . for those who defend life as the basis of existence , many difficulties will come .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

homosex@@ ual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
terror have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat , which depends like a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ ess on the local LGB@@ T@@ Q community , is not just over night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a tran@@ ss@@ ex@@ ual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of their experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the Republic .
LGB@@ T@@ Q @-@ legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured the international headlines in several months after reports , torture and killing of que@@ erer men in the Republic of the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aja Gas@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities , who took susp@@ ici@@ ously que@@ ere men and raised them into secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
even since her childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when they grow up , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she went to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ echn@@ ya experienced by gender equality , the hunt was opened to Sabrina .
she was afraid of her life to the United States last year .
Sabrina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organization .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ woman who was st@@ owed in trouble .
she had no money , so I took it without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone of whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread everywhere on the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen Friends , with the following message : &quot; then there is no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate these dis@@ grace ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents created the whole What@@ s@@ App round .
on October 10th , 2015 I was attacked .
when I was just doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car I heard a man &apos;s voice : &quot; here &apos;s a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I did hurt .
then I heard a proposition , but this time at Che@@ chen : &quot; how long will you still escape the family ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and a@@ woke up last end of the hospital .
apparently some women had everything together and started scre@@ aming .
the man had fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two words in my right lung wings .
OC Media : in which gem@@ s you were put - in which the men or women ?
Sabrina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor stood up and put me to the women .
I am very grateful for this .
when I read his name for the first time in his office , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ c@@ asian name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I appreciate him that he has been resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
I got threats from the last February .
they called me , wrote to me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ fall .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that everything was a lie .
they made absurd demands : some told me that I had to prove it by up without the roads ; others wanted me to open up in the official television in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my gender , that everything was only bad , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how has your family tries to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it &apos;s still difficult for them .
some older people answered once my m@@ um on the streets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , not only your family , but the whole republic were disappointed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we can &apos;t touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to van@@ ish from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she placed a rope around his neck .
luckily , the neighbours came and saved them .
at the time , I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later under the window , I got a car with a dark@@ ened window plates and a number plate .
after it had happened for the third time , I realized that there was something la@@ zy .
my human rights @-@ friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : what are you fled ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
I bought it without sign up , without identification , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
arrived and checked in the hotel .
the number was registered on a fore@@ ig@@ ner .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by What@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you &apos;re in safety , just because you left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you are st@@ eck@@ st . they even know your room number .
just to prove it : it &apos;s the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we do not talk about gender equality , this is a t@@ abo@@ o theme .
some traditionally Cau@@ c@@ asian elements are still in me .
as much as I wish , this sec@@ el@@ ian barrier can &apos;t overcome .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we chat with camera , I really admit to look like the person looking out of their past - thus , in my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what are your friends , those who have stayed there ?
Sabrina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for the needed I needed current information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked with somebody who received a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during the Ram@@ ad@@ an were not arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait , and he didn &apos;t stop a new wave .
most likely they will focus on family and relatives now .
that is what I mean , they probably invite their relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood gen@@ res .
OC Media : are there still gay men kept in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sabrina : an acquain@@ t@@ ance of me , there was just not many .
if , especially those who have not weal@@ thy relatives or that were dropped from their relatives to establish the Kad@@ y@@ rows Court .
as far as I know , they will be imprisoned there , so you can present them as terrorists .
say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies in television and claim they had attacked any village or military base .
you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but targeted specifically to radic@@ alise itself .
OC Media : is this now just a delay or do you have a source of that information ?
Sabrina : I just quote someone who was incar@@ cer@@ ated in Ar@@ gun for a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard grew .
since then there was nothing new from them .
they simply took them away .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was self @-@ taken when these people were taken .
until now they were not presented as a ban@@ dits , but there were no reports until now . we suggest that such actions are possible .
why would there not be allowed to shave this man to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings are people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already in the past ?
Sabrina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I believe that I was already familiar with Gro@@ z@@ ny before 2003 when I was living there - and I never had problems .
seriously !
even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
Russia would originally wanted to lead us to the &quot; Ci@@ vi@@ lization , &quot; but finally threw us into the st@@ one@@ age .
OC Media : what is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my eyeb@@ rows were sli@@ pped ; I had colored l@@ ashes , wore tubes and short tops .
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria has never made me a hair .
before the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met .
it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew of it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been insul@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a voice of phr@@ ases : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Say not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
people often say it often to children if they are fun over the sick .
OC Media : so they just keep their eyes closed before you , because they thought they are ill ?
Sabrina : yes .
they never have insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted , never struck .
OC Media : how long did this claim time have ?
Sabrina : so long , to Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about mor@@ ality on mor@@ als .
he didn &apos;t talk about us , but rather about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - one could feel how people started to change in the city .
everyone who had s@@ cour@@ ged and laugh@@ ed before , looked at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
in the meantime , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily deterior@@ ated .
OC Media : what activity do you now go after ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much .
apart from that , I have always worked as an activist .
currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I commun@@ ed with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we perfectly organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ els , gath@@ er@@ ings , I comp@@ assed them to the hospital and help them get eating cards .
I don &apos;t spend a p@@ enny .
I discovered these people themselves , when I dis@@ kl@@ ap@@ per@@ ate .
I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ al@@ ab ?
Sabrina : it is al@@ val@@ ry .
so nature , that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to make you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no sw@@ ings with them .
the Da@@ gest@@ an have those who have the Cab@@ ard@@ iner who have the Russians too , on the entire planet it is - but not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant to hear something .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ able Muslims walking into the mosque and during the Ram@@ ad@@ an fa@@ sten - live together with men .
you know , many think of transit identity of men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experience . but that &apos;s a chest .
these are two different things - two different kinds of emotion to be exact , different life@@ settings .
for me , it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed for my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry that I will be here personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I know that I am now myself .

the burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 , the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran , which is characterised by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the South West of Iran .
he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , which can asc@@ end the in@@ ability to his family , so Ah@@ w@@ azi @-@ Human Rights , who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube was the moments when he had lit himself , firmly .
some people make it quick to clear the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ rown hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the internal technologies were so strong that doctors could do nothing more .
he died short time later .
it was not the only suicide that happened in August in the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and activists in the place warned that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im .
their stories have a thing in common : there were all family fathers , who felt like persecution on the Iranian government , hel@@ pless and in@@ capable of feeding their families and to pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , in which a majority of Arab citizens living in Iran , was sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult to stimul@@ ate the native Arab population to dispute their livel@@ ihood .
a century ago , Arabian Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy assumed power and under@@ took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z Region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most valuable and valuable working areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite this valuable resource , regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the native population gets only little from this wealth .
it often is victims of untreated diseases , hunger and eff@@ u@@ sions .
the Iranian regime rejected the Ah@@ mad@@ azi regime systematically work@@ places in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also has a wide variety of tribes which are surrounded by the Arab areas in the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and Gh@@ om are surrounded .
these dam@@ s have only led to destroy the devast@@ ation in the region by dr@@ y@@ ness causing destruction to waste , and local agriculture , as well as fishing and palm trees .
the unemployment rate under the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi @-@ juven@@ iles rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Irish general director of cooperation , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is , who completed a work , completed 55 % a secondary school and completed 45 % a university degree .
a systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ ral human rights activist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of self @-@ mor@@ azi among young men .
Do@@ him@@ i said that especially the unemployment has become much worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic ethnic per@@ s@@ ers and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process :
since functional and institutions do not prefer Arabic labour , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi is moved from access to working possibilities in all sectors .
this is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to anni@@ hil@@ ate the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to con@@ strain their livel@@ ih@@ oods outside their home of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their fore@@ - and sur@@ names to hide their belonging to the gene@@ alogy , because even Arab names will not be toler@@ ated , because the speaking of Arabic language or the Arab language .
in view of the circumstances that the Arab of Ah@@ w@@ azi must endure , human rights activists beat alert before the situation gets explosive .
it remains to wait if the world is w@@ aking up and taking knowledge .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is inevitable .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I do not uni@@ fy myself with femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is an revised version of the opinion published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
they can be read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I &apos;m not a feminist , many women - especially white women , who advoc@@ ate himself as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
they are wonder@@ ing why I &apos;m not part of the movement .
they even thought well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments before me why I should be feminist and why we should generally have all femin@@ ists * .
for example , that women still earn less money in spite of the same education as men .
that women are still under strict observation , if it is about what they are allowed to do with their body .
violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women sooner or later meet in various areas of life to a glass ceiling , and that discrimination based on gender is still passing through the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and known .
I am convinced and I suffer double and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet : when I come to talk on skin color , rac@@ ism , black C@@ is women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI@@ Q community or in black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I mention that we were always under rac@@ ism and discrimination ; when I mention , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists were silent .
but they all agree that women - all women should come together to emp@@ t &quot; their voices , and &apos; Kum@@ b@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing &apos; to reach the equality ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that , in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is a institutional form of racial or motivated violence that we have exposed black women to two times .
or about that black women and women of other eth@@ n@@ ici@@ ties and country of origin will earn less than white men and women .
black girls and girls with mig@@ rant backgrounds are often referred to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spher@@ es and women with mig@@ rant backgrounds are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership , as white women .
on one hand , I want all women , all men and all men have neither skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot agree as a black woman , in whose center the white woman stands to take into account the un@@ righte@@ ous@@ nesses in their thinking , which relate to both gender as well as on the skin color of one person .
I &apos;m exhausted and won &apos;t fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere , which always and countless other black women always rejected me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said in 1851 in their speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also ref@@ uses to maintain a ide@@ ology in which the black woman is a human and mar@@ gin@@ alised nature . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join me group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs , to promote their eg@@ o@@ cent@@ ric program .
I will no longer try to increase white women the importance of over@@ lap of skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to say the importance of black women for feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to load them a better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give birth to women in different homes and to abst@@ ain from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; Femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am going to release myself full of femin@@ ism and to put me out of the Wom@@ an@@ ism , which for my dark skin and my status as woman was called into life instead of a white feminist para@@ dig@@ m , which is so stub@@ born that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now it is more important than ever before we define black women in our own ideas and give us the sphere , which will be created by us for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora &apos;s Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , author of the book of afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ an@@ ism : we can defend ourselves that we can defend ourselves in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , mental , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists instantly become separ@@ ations and mar@@ gin@@ alization , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contra@@ dictions of feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic area , I can emp@@ t black women and women of other cultures , because in this para@@ dig@@ m I exist .
I will be recognised because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a part of this para@@ dig@@ m .
I , a black wife , can blo@@ om in one environment , in which my life is neither over@@ turned , nor ignored , nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : the mission of a man to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this entry of To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports in@@ special about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a content @-@ sharing agreement this article will again be published here .
Maikel Mus@@ a entered the past 7 years - mostly with surf board or in can@@ oe - with a special request by the Kurdistan region in Iraq . its mission aims to make people the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains to us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of the pollution on its community .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river , which we had lost when I was a child , &quot; Mus@@ a tells .
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , construction of dam , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - which is involved in protecting the rivers , streams , and water ways in Iraq , as well as the local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ izes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we didn &apos;t want water any more , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was filmed and published for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bi@@ l , Iraq @-@ based documentary fil@@ mer@@ in and multimedia journalist , produced and published .
the focus of their work is followed , little noticeable sub@@ cultures and features the use of collabor@@ ative video photography and new multimedia techniques , with their help of supp@@ ressed municipalities that can tell their stories in their way .
b@@ ays Women and their tough@@ er fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group women represents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s mor@@ als in the country and in the region to express their re@@ jection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and worked version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by tur@@ ally . the article is part of the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # sof@@ ter smoking ) who reported on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect people affected .
a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she has nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their ex@@ partner who had become violent against violent .
since the end of their relationship , some time have passed and the police said , her statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed no abuse of abuse , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez did not profit .
a few days later , the second woman moved her ad .
to break the v@@ icious circle of violence against women , is difficult .
if women make an indication at all , they do not get support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financi@@ ally dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit , victims of violence to be registered at all in law en@@ forcement authorities .
In@@ side 1 b@@ lows and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible ab@@ uses and a legal system that doesn &apos;t under@@ estimate 3 b@@ ays laws : good approach , poor application strokes and statistics
it &apos;s hard to see how many women are really har@@ assed , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various data and reports that do not even ans@@ ate the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
however , the numbers available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the Office of the Office of At@@ tor@@ ney General 9@@ 600 advertis@@ ements for domestic violence . 70 % of them went to violence against women .
86 % of advertis@@ ements during the police came from women .
there were more than 5,000 ads for domestic violence in the peace of peace . there were also 86 % of the advertis@@ ements from women .
in the ads 40 % of women said they were physically har@@ assed , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic ab@@ uses .
these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an female minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di only few of these offen@@ ders are actually indicated also . &quot; on any woman who will not be re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed in Paraguay because of psych@@ ic abuse , 9 women will do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on any woman who are ref@@ unded for physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay was not lawful for criminal prosecution , the prosecution agencies cannot document appropri@@ ately how many women will be murdered every year by their current or former partners .
journalists killed at least 12 cases of women in the country alone until August 2016 .
the coordinator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men .

un@@ visible ab@@ uses and a legal system that doesn &apos;t under@@ take anything
before Mariana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the strong friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the name of all her former friends .
at the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she would have to regret . this should be regre@@ t@@ ted for ever .
today Mariana is 28 years old and not with Carlos together . but for two years she endu@@ red the psych@@ ic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recogni@@ zable :
I never thought I would have been victims of abuse .
when I read it earlier , I always thought that only women had happened to sub@@ jection to violent men , because they dec@@ eive of violent men .
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mariana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera .
without name , they wrote articles on Facebook where they described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told how he ins@@ ulated them .
many people answered their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically if he ever raised the hand against them and refused to confess that his behavior was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users also asked why they had fallen so long by Carlos and left him not earlier .
it seemed almost like that , as they wanted to say that victims of abuse should have at least a certain complic@@ ity .
Victoria Santos , who was not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner is har@@ assed her .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te CRE@@ O network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse .
in the group , they can talk with others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as Fall everything began with psychological abuse .
her weal@@ thy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Vict@@ ori@@ as advertis@@ ements in the authorities remained without earnings and also from their relatives , they received no support .
she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an in@@ consistent legal struggle between Paraguay and their homeland , where it was mainly about money , power and influence of their former partner .
b@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the abuse of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in the application of the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a draft bill was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ E@@ lla ( # Princip@@ al ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os movement ( # non insert ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original bill of the law sees to explain the fem@@ ini@@ d in a self @-@ standing criminal case and pun@@ ish harder as it is already in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the legisl@@ ature has changed in some points to also win the MPs for the law that were supposed to be denied the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions that are currently banned in Paraguay up to five years imprisonment .
the initial bill had fore@@ seen , the majority of the ( bureaucra@@ tic and economic ) process cost , which have to carry out the victims of violence even if they just want to create and receive a secure accommodation , to the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argued that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature does not provide sufficient financial resources available :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of human relationships .
here , a re@@ thinking must take place , so force no longer be considered a bit of normal .
in view of these facts , he is deb@@ ating and contributes to that the perpet@@ rators brought away the perpet@@ rators .
we have to refund for so long , until mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is no longer valid .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously parts of the law had been modified . among other things , one passage has been canc@@ eled , who called for the partners in the cases of domestic violence on reconciliation .
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section regarding reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the ag@@ gres@@ sor to attack its victims .
the submission of words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is considered a great set@@ back .
this article is the shortened and worked version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by tur@@ ally . the article is part of the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # sof@@ ter smoking ) who reported on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect people affected .
independent media in Oman a year after prohibition of a newspaper continue to be ass@@ aul@@ ted attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was locked due to a decision of the information Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; homepage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the om@@ anic authorities have closed an independent Arabic newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their coverage of corruption in the sult@@ an .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he served one year sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri were also arrested and ordered before the court , but later released .
Oman has been gover@@ ned by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn Said since 1970 , who came to power after he had his father , Said i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur , was killed by a state of affairs .
since then , along with his role as the only sult@@ an , the chief offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the sult@@ ans of the Sult@@ ans is characterized by the harsh effort of security forces , in particular the domestic secret service , including freedom of freedom , to limit and def@@ ending human rights , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activists , to in@@ timi@@ date and incar@@ n@@ ate .
the authorities fail peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights systematically and hin@@ ders citizens , also activists , to their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and detention of three of their editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported on corruption in Oman since its inc@@ eption in 2007 ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , took place in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 with the title &quot; High @-@ level parties bound the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; in this way it was corruption in the alignment and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions .
in the report government officials accused the judge of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to raise a judgment in a possession .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n from July 26 , 2016 with a report on the front page with the heading : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high level parties bound hands of justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo : fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ side of Az@@ am@@ n
on 3 August 2016 , he was arrested by Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , member of the executive committee , charged by the ISS Department and was arrested by the Security Council on his arrival .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS Deputy Chief Editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who was arrested in Chief Editor for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
the newspaper was closed at in@@ definite time after the information Minister had given the statement that &quot; the publication and spread of the newspaper on all ways , including online , will be banned from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Ab@@ ri took place on 26 September 2016 .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison , and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j , both among others , were convicted of distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of violations of an audience and de@@ fam@@ ation .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j was sentenced to three @-@ year prison sentences and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Ab@@ ri was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after the use of &quot; an information network to spread the material that could pose a danger to public order . &quot;
on 22 August 2016 , Al @-@ Ab@@ ri was set up a b@@ ail in the amount of 5000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Court of Appe@@ al said Al @-@ Ab@@ ri on 26 December 2016 , sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for a year and Al Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 to ban his six @-@ month prison sentence from the Central Pr@@ ison in M@@ ask@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his sentence in prison .
the Appe@@ al Court also lifted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper looks after attacks by the Cuban government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information received an instruction on which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Secretary of Information signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , confir@@ ming the Minister for the decision of the Court of Appe@@ als to restore the publication of the newspaper .
the constant closure of Az@@ am@@ n and attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where Oman has been injured in Oman by the press freedom .
for further violations , for example , the closure of the independent journal M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to present their operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of the journalist el @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not willing to prepare an end to the extensive violation of press freedom .
the Golf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) demands the om@@ anic authorities :
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally released ;
2 . to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3 . to protect the press freedom in the country and
4 . under all circumstances , human rights def@@ ici@@ encies and journalists un@@ hin@@ dered their righ@@ tist human rights in Oman and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ ans .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ concep@@ tions
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , figure out with his permission
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media only rarely or not mentioned . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need on locally medical research , there are two reasons : there are many medicines and vaccines required to cover the special medical requirements on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria have widely regarded as elsewhere in the poorest countries in Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investments for the exploration of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem .
secondly , research , which is carried out by African scientists themselves , helps to establish their research capacity in Africa . a major role in science and technology can only be implemented for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Centre for the exploration of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , especially when the AIDS epidemic showed first gra@@ zing effects on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , at first in Louisiana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania he explored himself on the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ concep@@ tions about this research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research subject ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work on the use of research results . I support the sam@@ b@@ ische national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just star@@ red a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB , and other relevant path@@ ogens .
g@@ v : what are your opinion of important scientific topics in your country and generally in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we use only solutions that have been developed differently .
this must change , otherwise we will always remain recipi@@ ents , instead of being mo@@ vers .
the solutions we get are often not suitable in our surroundings , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here .
g@@ v : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is to find appropriate scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
projects are funded differently well .
it is difficult to find people who come back or prefer , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work , which you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries . it costs much money , continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
lab material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
g@@ v : what is the opinion of science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
g@@ v : how great is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there are need of special scientific training , starting in any age .
social sciences , computer sciences , big data , exploration of world trau@@ mas , health care ( non @-@ transferable and infectious diseases ) , and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit .
g@@ v : can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa across Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often it &apos;s the limited speed , things to do , and make no access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines are only accessible to payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , also limited to the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from USA to India : like &quot; open source &quot; seed producers to change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine called on solutions for environmental issues worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on had a salad in the USA since the 1980s .
its company provides 114 sorts , such as the shred@@ ding , the first plant , which has been cultivated and consumed by NASA &apos;s ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work became only due to its own cas@@ u@@ sions and the question of how many of the types of salads can get limits .
but at the beginning of the 2000 , he noticed that more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding .
the patents are not only available for individual types , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special rot@@ or or green leaves .
over the past years , more such patents have been registered for ever more plants such as cereals or cart@@ ons . based on this trend , plant bre@@ e@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food safety in the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition , Mort@@ on is still a salad , but now he needs longer , since his work is becoming increasingly difficult .
&quot; it &apos;s like being a rock bro@@ ker in a river , in order to p@@ umping the p@@ umping .
so we have to do this now , but it &apos;s a bre@@ ach with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents are going to go far away to salads .
and if they with@@ stand before court , no one can breed a new salad of salads , because all the features are already patented . &quot; he makes it as good as possible , and tries to tell those attributes that he wants .
however , he is very careful and endeav@@ oured to use no material that is protected as intellectual property .
it has also connected itself to a motion that is always bigger in the US and anywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; breeding ) .
the ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS drew red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at of the sort Out@@ speaker in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; station , and eaten there . it is being tested if plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like this , the movement from the IT @-@ area would come and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software to provide alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was launched into life in order to ensure that some plant species and clubs are not protected as intellectual property and can be used permanently used for plant bre@@ e@@ ders .
in the framework of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , U.S. bre@@ eder can also under@@ take that others can use the seeds free of them .
this does not mean , however , that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eder only allow others to breed their seed to breed such as own varieties , and it is not immediately added - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ties .
dozens of bre@@ eder and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
for the em@@ onial professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ ss@@ i board , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of seed and the possibility of breeding new plants , both important for nutrition security and environmental protection .
seed plays a role in major inter@@ relations such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eder would try to ch@@ ill the latter , or ch@@ ill with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants .
all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from organic agriculture or Syn@@ gent@@ a , and Monsanto and Bayer , who would like to buy food and sustainable vegetables , which is also offered on farms in August and September 2016 , should also know that the way in which this vegetable is far@@ med .
nutritional im@@ perfec@@ tions without a seed guarantee is not possible . &quot;
the members of the open source Se@@ ed initiative are committed to others their seed should remain available freely . in contrast , their approach in contrast to the seed and plant features are to be patented .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights to plant materials , which is thus increasingly restricted , un@@ ce@@ as@@ able .
Claire Lu@@ by , director of the O@@ ss@@ i , employed in her PhD thesis with genetically variation in carrots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all cart@@ ot@@ ations are protected as intellectual property , making it even usable for plant bre@@ e@@ ders either .
for other plants there are no estimates yet , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggests that massac@@ red plants are patented in even larger style than let@@ tu@@ ce or carrots .
a Question of Vis@@ i@@ bility
plants are so cultivated that they would have targeted characteristics - such as their taste or color improves until such as they prosp@@ er in certain environments and with@@ stand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
ad@@ versaries of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eder is increasing by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is currently necessary than ever before , as the changes in climate change are much worse predic@@ table .
in an e @-@ mail , Monsanto &apos;s Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to recognize that genetic diversity was generally important and also crucial for mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four gen@@ banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture in the United States , the company set itself the company for conservation of genetic diversity .
however , it does not contra@@ di@@ ct that intellectual property transfer other bre@@ e@@ ders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant variant innovations . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow when the patent has expired .
often these instructions help others to come with another method at the same result .
such protection does not prevent innovations , but promotes the public more material and know @-@ how available by the public . &quot;
Mort@@ on , it looks different : wait 20 years until a patent expi@@ res , certainly no innovations .
and if you have to wait so long to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the fight .
the main argument for Mort@@ on is , however , that genetic resources have always been a general public and it should remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ e@@ ders have neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incen@@ tives are not attractive for us .
we want to make farmers work easier .
that is what drives us , and it is impossible to us if we are unable to still use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
in total , Mort@@ on interfer@@ on to the concept of construc@@ ting plant characteristics : &quot; we do not really create the features .
the plants form them out and as bre@@ eder , we finally have no idea how plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the U.S. state Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is still another important aspect of the plant breeding : &quot; if you breed a variety , its own values are breeding in them .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for whose cultivation of mass@@ aging her@@ b@@ ici@@ des are needed , bre@@ e@@ eing into its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
my concept is exactly opposite . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Monsanto ) patents have , they create most smaller seed companies , also to survive without patents - they either reject it or do it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on is looking for salads in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eder would be innovative by preventing plant pat@@ rons : &quot; it looks like I was able to produce new things with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that are patented .
I need new material for my catalog , as I know that my competitors are going to sell my varieties in a few years themselves , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent it is protected for 20 years before competition , with which it simply makes it quite simple . &quot; worldwide reson@@ ance
although the USA seem to be leading in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , however , the concept spreads rapidly throughout the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources , works a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . the centre with farmers collabor@@ ates and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seed and sell their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organization Agre@@ co@@ l is working on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i obligation for bre@@ eder in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( rules for breeding differ from country to land , essential for O@@ ss@@ i obligation , not simply to be one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
in early November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , explains that conventional far@@ med plants should not be patented . thus , it talks about the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allows patents on conven@@ tionally far@@ med plants .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is to put forward to the governments of the Member States to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and global trend towards pat@@ ern@@ ing seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &quot; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , &quot; that the organisation is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , for the scheduled start of the official starting date .
a merger from environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development organization US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and concentration - Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ cent@@ ration ) has compiled a database into seeds and biodiversity , to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a consortium of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report indicate that farmers have to be able to exchange and improve the seed industry , so that a stable supply of food can be ensured .
in the report , the importance of a diverse , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems empha@@ sizes - a context , by the Lu@@ by of O@@ ss@@ i hopes it will soon be more people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food mainly has been sacrific@@ ed , where and as something is grown , and seeds are barely played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now attemp@@ ting to clear the people that there is more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human Rights Organization and Blog are the newest goals of c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian authorities still un@@ lock content on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
on the weekend of the 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government locked up the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt , as well as the Arab world .
on August , the network published a statement on Facebook where it critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step sharp and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Reser@@ ved in bt@@ - despite this attack and participation in the Arab world and to defend a voice in this part of the world , so it was never so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirmed that all the technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the lock and do not im@@ itate . we wait to keep our task further .
AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked more than two months of 21 websites , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic language of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jazeera network of Al Jazeera for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web site barriers to victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
besides AN@@ HR@@ I there is no access to the blog of the colum@@ ni@@ sts and Human Rights Investig@@ ator Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spreading of colum@@ ni@@ sts and articles that he doesn &apos;t write available websites and media in Egypt .
now , the blog , which he raised to b@@ ypass the Egyptian government &apos;s ens@@ orship , even the aim of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider with whom Zi@@ adas blog is home , however , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested by Egyptian security officers in December 2013 , while he reported about the student protests and gave a video how the police arrested physical violence against two students .
his articles rotate mainly to politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook commentary , Zi@@ ada said to the lock through the government and reflected what this means for him :
the blog is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blocking of the blog is not meaningful to the world , so it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has been able to give me the feeling of a siege resistance ; an arrest , a attempted murder , un@@ loading at the National Security Council , the lock of Blogs and any other web site for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I was not in vain . in other words , my words have an influence , even if only a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to the post of articles to b@@ ypass the c@@ ens@@ orship .
however , after they blocked it , and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the Mu@@ tigen go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various internet service providers ( IS@@ P ) , among others Orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and Eti@@ qu@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of providers by converting internet c@@ ens@@ orship and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Network ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday , June 12 we saw how the blocking of Web sites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s began .
such practice indicates the intention of government to blocking content and filtering content , to which Egyptian users might have access .
in addition , the situation is made in addition to closed doors , ensuring that the Egyptian population has no right , with which it can proceed in judgment against those actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
fighting the inhabitants .

date for day report newspapers in Brazil with dark news from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard drawings .
some of these headlines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old was shot in school , &quot; Every second day a police officer took place in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Ser@@ ve screw@@ ed pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Air Force to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in an attractive financial situation , the force threshold of 2017 in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation , Global Justice , called the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these have become everyday , and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local newspaper .
thus , for the detailed reporting on violence in the Rio agreed newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 the Editorial &quot; That is not normal , &quot; in which it announced , a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision declared the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report on crimes committed in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual inter@@ rup@@ tures , etc . everything that happened from the civili@@ zed standard and what only happens in Rio will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative , so that we didn &apos;t close our eyes from cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes declared that this decision was not a reason for pride but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper on the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognise the war .
in the same video , a journalist discussed that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas , a journalist declared that the criminal organizations will be controlled .
in the Editorial , the newspaper wrote :
we are aware that a war of war , when it is dist@@ orted , can also be used , gr@@ ind the police , who first shoot and then ask questions to tu@@ ck .
but we defend war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Mafia and their partners .
would the designation &quot; war &quot; be profitable more than it ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Brasi@@ l , journalist C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira is argu@@ ing that violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this was in their opinion about a jus@@ tification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to commit responsibilities at the police .
this is no war .
this is the result of corruption and worse planning - such as extra in the analysis of the military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with in@@ sufficient investment in staff , education and an historical and self @-@ counterfeit neg@@ lect of the public service .
to memory : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just his capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Rio de Janeiro as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most violent place in Brazil is wrong : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 non @-@ violent cities in Brazil are in the north and north east of the country . these are the latest available data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no such cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we look at the murder rate per state , Rio is at number 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
specially , the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company of South America , emphas@@ ises such as C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia , has repeatedly been repe@@ ating the state policy of the state .
in addition to these security policies , the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the State of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a Fav@@ ela by using a massive police station and deployed a unit permanently .
at the beginning , this resulted in a decrease of non@@ violent deaths . for some years , the U@@ PP has led to several reports about shi@@ anas and re@@ pris@@ als against the poor municipalities which was supposed to protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Charle@@ aux pointed out of one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio will also have serious consequences for people after themselves .
for this , it demands the state to use , means and ways that are typical for a war . this is the int@@ ru@@ sion into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and the object for &quot; coll@@ ater@@ als damage &quot; and &quot; dist@@ orted balls . &quot;
war , or her , fact is that the inhabitants of the Fav@@ elas in Rio will continue to suffer .
one week it is now that the police inv@@ ents the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to sl@@ ash the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this force , this incident was made headlines : a fruit c@@ res@@ eller died due to shots , who fired the police from a helicopter .

since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime .
according to victories , a joint initiative of the Peace organisation PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , located in Damascus and Um@@ land , Homs , D@@ eir Y@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ li@@ b currently around one million Syrians in a state of the siege .
the region of East G@@ hou@@ ta is particularly strong affected , where an attack with chemical weapons requested the lives of hundreds of civilians on 21 August 2013 .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition , are based on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these of the rebels have controlled territories outside Damascus under siege , leading to the inhabitants caused by tun@@ nels and control points .
by the years of block@@ ade , traditional food products such as flesh has become un@@ att@@ ain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as an argument , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and acade@@ m@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of Eastern G@@ hou@@ ta , as they can plant their own fung@@ i as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call itself G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ draw@@ da and lead the project together with NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fung@@ i do not belong to the traditional , in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their nutritional value makes them an attractive food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed Eastern G@@ hou@@ ta .
Director of the project , subscription Nabil , said to the French news agency AFP :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultiv@@ ate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to flesh , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eila , one of the organizers , reported Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to introduce this project and expressed his relief that it now wins more and more . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use in consultation with NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ as the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to make 125 families of knowledge to grow of pilgrims , Dr. L@@ eila to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of the expected target of around € 12.@@ 700 , but will continue to collect donations on Can@@ Do until Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative is aimed at generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel short@@ age , locally manufactured fuels are used , in order to supply the generators to supply the necessary power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. L@@ eila said Global Vo@@ ices that they started the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of the fungus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
afterwards they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . as they succeeded , they used a larger bowl . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teaching farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have been distribut@@ ing mushrooms everywhere in East G@@ hou@@ ta .
Dr. L@@ eila explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; we want to teach people of different reasons : &quot; bre@@ ach of the siege .
providing a new source of food on the market .
dis@@ sem@@ ination of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency , eating habits ( such as paper , tea , coffee set , cardboard , etc ) to be used as a new food .
creating new jobs , especially for women working at home .

Portu@@ gues demand justice for the victims of the fires between 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested in the districts of Portugal in many districts of Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ra@@ mp@@ ed in the north of Portugal in the week .
two @-@ and forty persons died , and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October . this resulted in fact that the government proclaimed a week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fireworks set out in northern and central regions of the country and reached approximately 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande was a similar tragedy in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forestry monitoring system , which monitors land areas by satellite photos alone in 2017 in Portugal alone around 500,000 hectares of forest - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of Ernst of the situation : there is no fire in 4 bor@@ ou@@ gh@@ s .
the whole of Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a . ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017
some of Twitter users divided images :

numerous videos spread in the network and show images that allow better insights into action :
the conc@@ ei@@ vable tragedy
the protests from Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked themselves why the civil protection was not able to assass@@ inate the extent of tragedy so far as possible .
João So@@ ver@@ al from the Bund of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing ev@@ acu@@ ated .
this Sunday they did nowhere : there are dozens of reports from open roads that were surrounded by fire .
in Lei@@ ria &apos;s forest , a similar tragedy happened as in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
in addition , construction permits will be disp@@ le@@ ased with high risk of risk .
a far @-@ sufficient suggestion to the Wal@@ dem@@ on , which had entered the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was objec@@ tion@@ ist by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstac@@ le to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government led a sl@@ ashing of the law , if the applicant could have a means of self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; João Sor@@ val carries out the same article in the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Quer@@ cus pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees , trees from slightly combus@@ tible wood , turned out in a v@@ icious circle according to fires of this kind .
regarding these problems , the website of the civil protection from Portugal will be found on October 15 and 16 , when residents sought information or attempted to contact members , offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information provided by the application f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real @-@ time via the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developers of João P@@ ina in order to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire brig@@ ade and was decisive at this fat@@ eful weekend in October so that the servers were following the on@@ s@@ lau@@ ght of the 400,000 users , who persecuted the fires , were not counting more than half a million .
even the founder asked for help :

even Google , finally , made a contribution to help the site to continue .

a lot of recognition was also spoken to the fire fighting , which until the exhaus@@ tion was done in the fight against the flames .

the way from refugee from Afghanistan to successful entrepren@@ eur
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati and his friend and colleague Y@@ as@@ in Tan@@ in in Venice .

during a night in autumn 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began the Taliban .
two years ago , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings , which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan had become a country of terror and despair .
exactly at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner together .
even if his mother didn &apos;t say so at that time , she knew she would not see her son much more - maybe even more .
the boy was to break up in the morning .
his uncle would pick him up , and bring him to the bad .

Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ ara @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt un@@ protected .
the Taliban is getting closer to their hatred for the Haz@@ ara .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a co@@ h@@ let . the work was heavy and he made him sick .
then he took what was left of his low wages , and went into Iran . once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and tow@@ ed sacks with mort@@ ars who were heavier than he himself to make himself living .
at that time , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterised by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , where we also worked .
there was no services and no heating . we hung n@@ ylon in front of open windows , so that we don &apos;t er@@ fr@@ inge at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af made his life without documents in Iran and made ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities refused his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , running alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church which divided up twice a day meal in needy .
it is true that Italy because of relatively high awareness rates is a kind of second chance for asylum seek@@ ers . it is true , however , that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system suffers from a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of the asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; special recording centres . &quot; there are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers will only be assigned to an admission center if they have officially signed an application for asylum - which after registration of the asylum seek@@ er can still be moved .
till then , people who have no money for an apartment , either need to rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so there was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his imper@@ tin@@ ent life of life helped A@@ shar@@ af to free himself from these conditions .
after spending several years in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af stir@@ red up its total savings to the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that he still opened a second hostel after a while .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis Succ@@ ess Story is the subject of documentation &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
lots of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of obstacles .
according to official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of Afghanistan @-@ owned enterprises have emerged , including cutting shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Oriental Experience , in which the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff consisting mainly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells about the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the story of their journey to Italy .
Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome also Afghanistan .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals however go far beyond the Italian restaurants and the retail , and aim to return to the country , which he had to leave imp@@ air@@ less than teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I never forget my country , and I can &apos;t live happily when I know my people suffers .
I plan a project for farmers from the country &apos;s poorest provinces , especially for women .
they represent half of the society and must get the same possibilities like all others . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ged plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul in which the people can sell packaging and preservatives . &quot; so they can sell their appointments on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubts , but in the end there are stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans in this way .

the Egyptian Parliament checks a bill of bill , which fore@@ sees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after a registration in a government authority .
users have to be able to use social networks within six months after the successful legisl@@ ature order to submit its full name , as well as its ID number .
those who have failed this step could be sentenced to six months in prison or the end of a criminal complaint .
the law , which was recruited by sixty members of Parliament , is currently being deb@@ ated to the legislative and constitu@@ tion@@ alist committee of the Parliament and should be deb@@ ated there .
in May , another member of Dep@@ u@@ ties filed a legislative proposal to be introduced in the har@@ row pen@@ alties for the President or a High officials .
under Egyptian law , the president of the president as well as government agencies are already fir@@ med . however , under the law proposition an act of action would be broken with prison and fin@@ es , so legal experts from Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should the law be adopted , this can mean by three years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jail term &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , this would under@@ go a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of freedom has been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud subscription Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he was demonstr@@ ating Egyptian police officers , demonstr@@ ating violence against prot@@ esters that had led to the administration of the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 protest participants , who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in jail at a court date .
recently , his trial was post@@ pon@@ ed on 20 May , because the prison line was imposed on human rights groups to bring the def@@ endants from prison in the court room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , head@@ light of such arms , illegal gathering , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza asked the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indicted for their reporting to pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of journalist Abdullah al @-@ F@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mustafa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , aged 25 years to 5 years .
tun@@ ic activists interro@@ g@@ listening to tun@@ ic activists
in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ g@@ ation of Sami Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia , mainly attributed to a sc@@ anned action plan , was supported by the President of the Republic , which according to the plan expressly provides a controversial law bill , of the business@@ men and during the former regime by dictator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali who would acc@@ use corruption .
the document published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , poses a light to look like the preventive plans for the support of the legisl@@ ature .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nam@@ ing of his sources , indicating article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press complex , which journalists enter@@ tain the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he joined the district court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness .
will China force the user of social media to present their ID ?
according to new regulations on the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the user social media in China require permission to write or share messages in social media .
in the provisions , the registration is also indicated that registration will be required with the full real name .
analysts suspect that this will be achieved by the elimination of anonymous comments in the social networks within the social networks . it is now un@@ clear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese networks have proposed the social media to only selective these regulations to protect the journ@@ alism and independence .
then let &apos;s see you in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may the state c@@ ens@@ orship of Russia closed the access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat was to register in the state government as &quot; organizer of information &quot; .
this term is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government organis@@ es a list of online services that provide the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make responsible services responsible for removing contents and force them on request to en@@ force user data .
these websites currently include websites like V@@ contacted and Od@@ no@@ pr@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has leg@@ ging Wikipedi@@ as
a Turkish court ruled the lock Wikipedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administr@@ ators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the data , Turkey will support the jihadists in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication was on , the site has been locked because they joined &quot; an information source that co @-@ operates with groups to attack a political diff@@ am@@ ination campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey is blocked the website completely . it is therefore China , one of the few countries worldwide , in which access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain cannot stop , stir up
after this week , the government in Britain is under a deliber@@ ate consultation on higher surveillance mer@@ cies that the Internet service providers would force to monitor communications providers in real time , to monitor data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services on the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population .
despite all , the consultation is still running until 19 May . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of Interior .
