<seg id="1">Although I visited the USA at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my generation I grew up with American films, American authors have read and operated by American authors.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a profound profound effect on me that I was mainly found because of an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter, who covered himself with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura-Stuff, who wanted to occupy the Supreme Court with judges who wanted to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free according to Method Man," "" "I was, as if it's the absolute truth, forget everything I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I was living in Arizona, my admiration had only intensified for the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country where I ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting you can always be who you are and it's easy acceptance in a community of equal people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very painful love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascending is for me, as he goes with his narrow-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain, as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague, and openly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-American and Women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his testimony and voted in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes, whom he won at the Republican elections, was the highest number one reached by the party nominated candidate ever.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigotte person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not bring trump and his voters to the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the Journalism programme, people from around the world, a deeply believing man, with whom I could entertain myself about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trumps is not backed by Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to see the "Phoenix Suns" when watching.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to generosity which I experienced in Sandy Bahr, who fights for their lives in the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family that treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">It still fits to the dedication of Kristi Kappes that always helped me with much patience and grace to me and my colleagues, to accustom us to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew leakey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser council helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those are embodied by them by embodied my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump found his way to nominate republican Presidential candidates, they gave me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out, however, that they were the exception of rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly whites, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of its contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The discussion with the idea that people voted for trump, because they either shared his racism and fanatismus, or because they were willing to oversee these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to describe the trump-electors as rampsts.</seg>
<seg id="34">To arrange the people, one of my friends, is exactly what led us to that situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities cannot be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of whom most are white, voted for drump because they want to regain control over a country, which she has disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look differently than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(OB.): as much as" "" "rebellion of the white against all other ethnicities" "" "; word game from white in response to the White and Whiplash, as did the big Van Jones" "", "exactly what America has made so great." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you may always have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country elected as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history he says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the choice of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the White America's promise and says: hell with versatility, religious freedom and the concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11, the white man is again at the Ruder, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this, I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier, who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration of Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have been my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your United States?" Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your United States?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they called them and their voices were louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would anyone who is not like you, a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loudly "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan ended with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't that of America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country, for whom his son was like, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Land, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people like Mr. Khan, could not find no place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What is the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero municipality in the province of Oaxaca, with the children of the paraguaean city Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">The music that is played in both places, not only the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, just 16 kilometres south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an ancient colonial city that is very popular among tourists, but worlds apart from nearby prehistoric ruins and of its world famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years, La Banda de MÃºsica (music bande) has been playing in the community: one of children and adults existing symphony orchestra, which has found an opportunity for overcoming the surrounding poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A school of school with 100 students became the central interest in the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and bands.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a coincidental encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth had a rare hope of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI writes:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with shining eyes and play in the gubel you meet day for day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timke, bongos and the conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically on the biggest garbage dump of Asuncion in the capital of the capital - on instruments which are made of restored waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with restored instruments, made up of local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycling of Favio ChÃ¡vez has started to turn parts of the waste in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, viola, Celli, contrabasses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion that were all made out of the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan, Latin American music and music by the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times Favio ChÃ¡vez reminds of a local ecologist and musician teachers of the children of Cateura, at the initial time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach in the same place, the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents, because many of them do not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was a bit shown, which he had never seen before: a violin produced by a waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a complete orchestra which plays on instruments from restored material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentary called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tons of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and live by him are the poorest - like men in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they transform it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landing Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspiring spectacle of garbage-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra played music even before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These Eastern African countries show how technology and teamwork can fight illegal fishing companies</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing is fought.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The release happens in an agreement with Global Voices to joint use of contents.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberian waters before the other coast of Africa was seeking.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were correspondent over accordingly, and little inclined to welcome the criminals of this kind in their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the comrades, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobile mobilised rapidly against the ship. they refused to share one of their ports and refused to share a fishing permits.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries, which all of you refused," "" "Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan fishing industry. he is part of a team that discovered the ship of his time and followed." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to pillaging the country's stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which protects criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO stop illegal fishing (Illegal fishing stop).</seg>
<seg id="107">Alongside Somalia and Madagascar, members of this network are six countries, which then drove the prime minister out of their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are conspinned and working together. they exchange information and stand each other with illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending illegal fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is caught, is hidden, essential because it is extremely difficult to find out. thereby, illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing in regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the deliberate abregard of existing laws, the illegal fishing ecosystems may harm the illegal fishing ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But during actions against illegal fishing once caused by bureaucratic hurdles, and also through the worm-empo, with the information between individual countries, these actions happen today in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange licenses, learn news on suspicious activities or details, which you noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive, when they move on the open sea, using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This enables the authorities to characterize ships which fish in the banned areas - such as suspects that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such examinations may show whether the involved ships have a fishing licence, where they were on the road and possibly, whether they have a criminal justice.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing, can use the assumption of such ships in their ports. what does that the ships can't sell their cargo. and that they could even be forced to commit to the numbers of punishments, as in the case of Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it's about significant financial losses for the owners, which means illegal fishing is financially worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, Senior Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant responsible for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform has been created to gain an estimated $20 million of lost turnover, which will lose eight members of the HISH network each year due to illegal fishermen that penetrate East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies, such as the region of commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">These practices include activities such as sailing under false flag, fake license documents, specifying of imagery seeds, fishing protected species and fishing in protected areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "they use targeted international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-consuming control system," "" "says Long." "" "a ship was illegal and a country could say" "" "you mustn't run my harbor." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. and just this legale loophole tries to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has exposed criminal networks, which had distributed counterfeit licences in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and has found winged ships and found.</seg>
<seg id="128">Because of its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority for combating crimes, FISH can share information on illegal fishing over large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"some of our investigations show us quite wide in the networks of organised crime," Bergh says.</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that should help FISH, suspicious ships more precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system that is always developed, also helps to track the illegal ships to hide themselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "says Duncan Copeland, leader analyst at Trygg Mat tracking, an NGO, which also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer run out of satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping to build a system which connects different information levels. it should help FISH help finding criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence global problems of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened together with Google and the Oceans Oceana platform: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed globally through the position of any traceable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "with the neighbors, to get a better picture of it, who does what is doing - this simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We should do this on a global level. "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run with which a global system permits the persecution of ships.</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only criminals but it is flocusts.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that were previously used without a license and hardly have any consequences too, know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu some of the countries involved in FISH-i participated in a 33% increase in fisheries, since fishing boats increased more licences.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia helped, Greko 1 found out, the inspectors have been on board towing, their use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">Other countries observe these successes. "the effect is so strong that we now have other countries," says Kiilu. "we are a study project." "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars will disappear annually through illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "in 2015, six countries have joined the West Africa Task Force for the so-called West Africa Task Force." "" "the aim is to fight illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH." "" "security is the goal to create more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's youngest member of Somalia was in its first big triumph: in October, it was named Greko 1, a ship travelling under false flag. and not only the ship was on the way without a license and were used tow-nets that are now banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was still located in forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "" with the take of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they act against illegal fishing, "says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH, this is another success of many. and at the same time, evidence that such a special, collaborative work of work in the oceans actually works throughout the world.

<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced out of his father to watch the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine town of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>

<seg id="201">In the trial which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were examined which were committed during the Argentinian military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano isn't looking for his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the brushes, the same name as his father will carry up to the brutal military operations in the La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he retained the family secrecy for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I believed that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, you do not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I could not know that my father was a thief, torturers and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarming officials. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, his father was Deputy Commander of the intelligence department 141 in prison La Perla.</seg>

<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quixjanos son, a man who had experienced the extent of atrocities that he had experienced as a boy, and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows which great power has a parent about his child and how this child chose a way of salvation.</seg>

<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it would be alright. because so my father loved me.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base, I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners.</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times a total of La Perla - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time he ordered me to get out. he led me to a barracks, in cars, furniture, TV, refrigerators - all possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a little bit wrapped in a blanket, and ordered me to wear it to the car. when I opened it, I saw it was a large clot of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On this day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen objects were removed and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I laughed in and saw a song, tortured on humans.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field-bed and metal-feathers.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that it was attached to the end of a Cabal. the other end was attached to the body of the person who had just been there.</seg>

<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible for someone else to do so much suffering?</seg>
<seg id="248">'i know that these people were killed '</seg>
<seg id="249">When my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - to the area where the prisoners were tied with handcuffs and they carried to the eye.</seg>
<seg id="250">He spoke to "Chubi" Lopez (Jose LÃ³pez, a civilian which was also charged in the process) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a series of mattresses, on which naked people were on the face down - all were folded at hands and feet.</seg>

<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were allocated as part of the process of deprivation a number.</seg>
<seg id="265">When they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the order came from above that they should be moved.</seg>

<seg id="288">At that time, the Defence accused me of being a co-prescription for this crime. I answered, no problem, they can lay my burden for me what they wanted.</seg>

<seg id="344">The sign with the translation errors to a centre in Kyoto, where you can prolong his driving licence.</seg>
<seg id="345">The photograph was spread in social media.</seg>
<seg id="346">Processing of the original photos by Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his driving licence in the last month, witnesses of a very particularly misused translation.</seg>
<seg id="348">In a shield, the Japanese word (koreifensha), the "older driver" means, falsely - perhaps also with malicious background thoughts & # 8212; as "awful motorists" translated.</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was made from 1 to 20 September on electronic readings in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Handling the original photos by Joshua Levine, divided into the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was the translator Julian Holmes, a inhabitants of Kyotos. he was also who made the local loids carefully.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto, Kyoto, which appeared in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that nobody has read the translation of the translation.</seg>
<seg id="355">This is an insult for elderly people and in an international city as Kyoto just unacceptable, "Holmes said.</seg>
<seg id="356">The flawed English translation was initially removed. the designation "Mount drivers" (german: "awful motorists") was later replaced by the appropriate but grammatically not entirely correct name "Elder drivers" (German: "older driver").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police in Kyoto predictated for the translation errors. furthermore, it declared that the error was already contained in the text that they had received from translators, and that the translation was not tested for their correctness before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "I am really sorry that older people felt by inadequate correction (translation) in our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News sat down with the phenomenon of the "terrible" older driver in Japan, and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "awful" was denounced as an inappropriate description of the drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents are still relevant to concern.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto Prefecture, for example, 1.941 of a total of 19.460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this represents a percentage of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors 1,803 caused a total of 11.850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">With this, their share increased to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has decreased, the proportion of seniors caused by seniors have increased in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">The naming non-mentioned reporters published in the article published by the article comments to light, showing the prejudices some Japanese seemingly against older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on Yahoo via the translation error received following comments:</seg>
<seg id="368">- "Is this (" terrible motorists ") about not the reality?"</seg>
<seg id="369">"" "" "" "so the translation is not at all, isn't it?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="370">"" "-" "" "I don't think that is a real translation error." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="372">Why "Engrish" is so common in Asia</seg>
<seg id="373">Translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia.</seg>
<seg id="374">The Engrish.com website is a real treasure trove for this bizarre mistake in English.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of transmission errors are varied.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the text-text and active language skills to send him to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is in the case of parent language. in general, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native language.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should be translated from English to French - not by French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies don't employ a staff with English as a mother tongue who could translate translations into English. this may be lacking understanding of the oversetting, cost-being, or the relatively low number of English native speakers that learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that have no foreign employees themselves, do not produce firming translations. then the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is considered the best, to translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with fun results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The verdicated and enigmatic sentences, which arise through machine translations, show that technology can not yet replace a human translators. this applies to some languages very special.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formutations in Japan, among them also the enigmatic prints that often decorate T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylish reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or acceptable as jewelry, or at least harmless. but by big companies or from the government that have the resources to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The City of Kyoto, in future, uses a serious source for their translations.</seg>

<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users, that they would have no access to the Vivoplay online station.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later another user wrote that the internet appearances of VPITV and El Capitolio TV are no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online channels also contributed to the protests in Caracas, which were organized by oppositionist groups, against the government of NicolÃ¡s Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in early April, after the Supreme Court disbanded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was connected, and recommended users, VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Censorship: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that internet sites Venezuelan provider are locked once again.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the site of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular with internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been on the reporting on protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission threatened them with fines and closure if they continued to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission looked for "Call to Violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national television channels, I registered myself at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">Amazing that this is still cheaper than to buy two litres of limmonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEinfiltro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay is inaccessible by a blocking of the domain name system (DNS), but also two other online stations. this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transfers their sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier research studies of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, showed that the local Internet provider will sometimes utilize DNA. this is a technology through which the DNS servers of certain domains are correct.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNA, the server responds or refuses to send the request to such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elapoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">On VPITV, a third locked channel, the broadcast was set on Thursday, April 6th, when the VPITV camera's Elvis Flores, who carried the protests in Caracas, was taken into custody.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten, while he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels still have access to YouTube, the government is reported to have access to the Internet connections: the Venezolanern will continue to keep access to multi-media coverage of the current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation from the university, she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride on her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">The one has become something, "she said.</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she began to work as Criadita for the family. when Criaditas are known to work in Paraguay, more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The shop is quite simple: a big family with little money over their minors son or her underage daughter to another, rich family. in exchange, the child receives food, training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children have to pay for countless days of housework, which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that as part of a treaty you cannot raise.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice described as Criadazgo is widely used in Paraguay due to participation and acceptance by large parts of the society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing his studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected witness testimonies, recherished and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things in the name, because the feeling of gratitude, that will be vaccinated with the Criaditas, will not be silent in general.</seg>
<seg id="429">"Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">"" "there is the family that will improve their daughter in the faith that they can close their training, improve their position in society and" "" "something from itself" "" "to another family." ""</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family that puts the girl with itself and justifies the exploitation of faith that she would give someone a chance, who would otherwise have received no training, and perhaps even starved.</seg>

<seg id="436">When Carolina MarÃ­n came to hospital in CaaguazÃº, her body showed traces of fierce battles. shortly afterwards she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military-affiliated TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo who works as an official at the residents of the population.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived with them in her house in VaquerÃ­a, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="440">By the end of January 2016, Ferreira struck off as long as a stick on MarÃ­n until they suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">Some days later the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They emphasized that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the deep in the paraguayan society responsible for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They identified the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest together and demanded that there will be no other Carolina "in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>

<seg id="455">The Criaditas are not only exploited than labour, they also live isolated from other girls in their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, where her father worked, had to subscribe and her father lost his job.</seg>
<seg id="457">Her brothers had to work all and started to sell money on the street or on the market candy to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita to the capital Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of their employer, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time so that you still had time for learning.</seg>
<seg id="462">It stood up at 5 o'clock every morning and prepared the breakfast for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">Fridays for example, she cleansed the fridge, washed the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was at the end, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more they had done with learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But even this time was limited, because they had to make dinner for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but did not get unlimited food. "I was allowed to take more books from the library of the house as a food from the fridge," she remembers.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the master, a former military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party, which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">On several occasions the master of the house Alvarenga, in addition to him stand and read Editorial from opposition, such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">In doing so, he tried to convince her, to give the reports of the official media on the regime's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">He retained her for intelligent, but not with her. "the master of the house had found somebody who listened, while he spoke about politics," she says.</seg>
<seg id="472">"" "" "" "they didn't allow me to visit my family because they were the opinion that I heard there again" "" "bad habits" "". "so they supposed that Alvarenga belongs to the indigenous group of Guarani who would speak at home again their native language GuaranÃ­." ""</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they had allowed the education that they had enabled to lose, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="474">However, it was completely clear that they had paid for everything they had paid from them with their hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also in the school, Alvarenga was discriminated. "one thing about which is almost never spoken, are bullying and the chicans that Criaditas are exposed to school when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents, a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone to home. I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, during the time of friendships I sensed, I felt particularly clear that I didn't belong to any group.</seg>
<seg id="479">The isolation was the worst of everything, "Alvarenga explains.</seg>

<seg id="500">Image of Pixabay, changes from Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections recently agreed a bill to "the regression regarding the usage and commercial social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">If he is accepted by Parliament, users of social media must be registered in Egypt at a government office to use social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">On the basis of the law, a place would be set up, which is to be commissioned to share citizenship and citizens to share social media.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with acceptance of the law, user accounts and users have to register on the site of the site with their right names and staff numbers to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do this, this could bring a sentence of up to six months in jail or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs and in local media, including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "jedwede application that runs over the internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video surveillance and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is passed when the law is assumed, as Egyptian authorities are supposed to be imposed on users, such as Egyptian authorities, who do not register, considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media company.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyadh Abdul Sattar, member of parliament and promoter of the Law Firm, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a user name and password "by the firewall that blocked Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt is planning to set a firewall around national level around Facebook. because of those it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians, to submit information on their identity to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it's not known yet, that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts and experts are skeptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Techniculty (in German "Senior Research Institute") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, German "Egyptian initiative for personal rights"), told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt strongly to the technical capacities and understanding of each authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that just as they are violent physical public and private rooms, it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">When I take it seriously, this means that they are able to set up a strong monitoring system to apply for citizens who apply a permit or not. and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to carry out a judicial process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"" "" "" "to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the legislature and the Constitutional Court before it debuted in the plenary debate." ""</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether its acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not, the draft "is consistent with a pro-military thinking in parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and ensured that no deviating narration is present on the image area," says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">Last year, the parliamentarian Tamer El-Shahawy proposed a legislative proposal against cyber crime, in which a life imprisonment for those were intended to threaten the "public order" and "to protest."</seg>

<seg id="525">High above in the mountains of Kurdistan in the northeast of Iraq, the Zana Ahmed Raza and their team of scientists from the non-governmental organisation Nature Iraq work to protect the ambition Persian leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the bigger family of leopards, which strike through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). in total, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are due to wilderei, loss and fragmentation of their habitat and as they will always find less loot, endangered.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza shows up in the video, "the Persische Leopard is the only remaining pirate in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and growth of ecosystem depends on that a big predatory is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in fact is small and goes against zero. when the team rests in the video that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist, Raza passionate loves to treat another side of their country, which is not only from war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">It has been involved in campaigns for six years in field studies of wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="532">It has also been a member of the IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group since 2013 and assumes that protection zones for wild animals in the Kurdistan region have been established.</seg>

<seg id="538">Six years after the tsunami: the state of things in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011, and still occupied the region with reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, documented in the northeastern Japan, daily Kahoku Shimpo, the progress made in the last six years have been affected by the "Thirty disaster" of March 2011. an enormous earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in the Miyagi prefecture. Miyagi Prefecture was a etrable prefectures in Japan's northeast which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring islands of Fukushima and Iwate were forced to attack, because the tsunami had vanished whole coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, Fukushima prefecture experienced a nuclear accident, even so alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows a local view that progress has been achieved six years later in order to re-establish the life of local buildings.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of Japanese rebuilding authority and poll results of the affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts (bazahadean, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was the largest success under the three prefectures, 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima with 70 percent is the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">Even six years after the disaster, evacuation of heating revenues (bazetsu juutaku) is still trying to settle in final replacement parts.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the threefold catastrophe, almost 80 000 people were forced to live in shelving shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 we still lived 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the global fleet of evacuated from Fukushima still live in shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuation, which were finalised after the disaster in housing subdivisions, were resettled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">Working and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo-Newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools have returned from misfortune, that opens their gates up to December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures are far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 percent of the harbours in Iwates and Miyagi are now back into operation, in Fukushima only 30 percent of fisheries harbors their operation in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and nuclear accident, in the three prefectures of agricultural land have greatly affected.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the agriculture in Iwate and less than 50 percent of destroying farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic fact, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 acres of destroyed fields of Fukushima, are located in the "nuclear barrier zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism extensively recovered, but Fukushima remains far off here.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent in the same state as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can be only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that since the disaster has almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population being prepared for the next big earthquakes?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a total image, the newspaper led numerous surveys conducted among the native population and evacuation by the evacuation. she asked them about the status of reconstruction and, as well as their indignation has changed over the tsunami-risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey in order to bring more about the tsunami consciousness under the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of local residents who have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents say that still not enough in disasters prevention was done.</seg>
<seg id="575">What about those who were evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue to the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has strengthened its attention also to the situation of the evacuation of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had not only had to experience the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture was also witness the worst, disastrous cause, nuclear failure, the Japan ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were installed in areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, slightly more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, had been resettled in permanent spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="580">After 2017, more than 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima live outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuation areas are older than 50 years old. you have to regain the efforts for reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects. this is about construction projects, which are part of the Olympic Games in Tokyo that will take place in Tokyo.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people meet people from other countries, which speak a different language, the differences appear to be larger than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, one often recognizes that one more links than it seems to be at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remember that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices podcast, we look at this global connections. in our Into the Deep podcast we treat topics that often get less attention in reporting often than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strong with someone about linguistic and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni speaks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Egheri explains how the love for music has worked in rural China; Adriana Macias talks about the time she worked with people from around the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences, which he collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, studying social sciences at the University of GoiÃ¡s, studied a brain trauma and suffered several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors made him this Saturday and now put it into an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local picture journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which quickly spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the images, too, the face of the police officers came to identify with a ravine. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident the military police arrested in the Brazilian state of GoiÃ¡s that Sampaio was suspended until the conclusion of the incident at the incident of the active service.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the Act of Ãlvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugarcane factories in Cuba opened the doors. (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, which is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - known, regardless of its that there is no notable sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities were paralyzed in the sugarcane factory.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the fall, the sugarcane industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost after and after its plants, until only the rumor of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others signed and commutes daily to the factories, which still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a Soldatenvy, which is open every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not wander his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugarcane factories in the east of the region, which are back in operation after a long inactive time, because they were received.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he was not expecting.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers exactly that in MaÃ±alich would receive the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry has already withstood the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, inefficiency, the bad administrative decisions, and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no more news anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was Cuban sugarcane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway bridge of the village looked even better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The crushing of the sugarcane industry was an economical necessity: the 155 sugar mills were technically outdated, and hardly competitive, they were unsustainable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus on the production of most efficient factories, the annual production facility was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories which can produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugarcane plantations and the sugar crisis on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price descended before about a decade.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 Report, published by the OECD and FAO, the UN and Food and Agriculture Organization.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tons), the raw sugar rate would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"the present day is to go into history with safety in history," these were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero.</seg>
<seg id="653">The process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">During the following years, the disclosure of a total of 98 sugarcane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as a soldier, is known about the closure of the factory, is the word that he repeats the most, "fraud."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents in the same opinion is not one of them informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to maintain the place, they formed a full time - working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first sight, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially referred to as official documents, which would only be removed in terms of parts that would be removed, the address sat and the date distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could make any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">The responsibility was taken over there, and the letters were more common.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the set-up factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the still used sugarcane factories."</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waits for retirement in another plant, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved with his will at the decommissioning of the factory, in which construction he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">In every part he took away, he dismantled one of his 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area of Cuba and the main workplace producer was wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, there were no alternatives for the workstations and services to generalise the facilities in the communities where they were located.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know if during the Mammut speech of October 21, 2002, the then President in the eyes of the present people saw when he guaranteed that their factories were no longer in operation for five years, everything would run smoothly.</seg>

<seg id="672">Since 2004, sugar cane has been extracted only high by grind.</seg>
<seg id="673">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="674">After two years, the national community Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich met that many things are changing, but not getting better when a factory is closed.</seg>

<seg id="689">First Nations youth use hip-hop to express itself and maintain their own culture</seg>
<seg id="690">Recording a song of "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo used with permission of N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">Young People's First Nations communities in all of Canada deal with topics that are important for them. they do with hip-hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">Since 2014, as part of the N'we Jinan Tour has been bringing mobile audits directly to schools and youth centres to teach groups of songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by the pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in North-Quebec with ten crew communities and then with the Cree hip-hop group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop goes out that the young participants in talks topics such as "cultural identity, speech, discussion, love, self-exclusion" or what is coming to them in mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos, in which the youngsters are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the strain of the Winnebago in the US state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">For example, this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears" on a road in Westkanada, where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not explained.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First nation uses the motive of a video player to convey how important of the obtaining traditional customs and customs, despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people don't always master the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First nation has recorded, the refrain will be sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The people involved here received some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop-Group, who received a Strophone in the dialect of Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the facebookside of N'we Jinan, the Strophe is available in a transcript, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody ever interest in myself</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on earth after my days</seg>
<seg id="707">That's the day you won our cry?</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life as a youth.</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise to one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and be preceded by our youth.</seg>
<seg id="712">Thus, they can do that, why it dictates the Creator.</seg>
<seg id="713">In comment, the reader and supporters of the Cree-language Kevin Brousseau also provides a contribution and adds the Strophone in Silenames (which is also published on his blog and published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan one can see in front of almost every restaurant plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what is right on the menu, are located near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (bazzy, "Plasticular models of the dishes") are served by every food that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see this plastic dishes, decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry that is dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the tokioter district Kappabashi there is a variety of these small businesses that include those plastic dishes, which documented the German filmmaker Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga before over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">Most of the Japanese are these plastic dishes so usually that they do not catch them more. however, a new trend does not transform them today in showy mobile phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the blogger itinii series published series of social media links and photos that illustrate this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in the special sale: new with plastic shredded mobile phones, as they can be shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods were transformed to kitschy collects, as in this case, refrigeratormagnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shooting refrigeratormagnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of the essentials is increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, a cave-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was turned into a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile phone support.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also manufactured this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple holding her cell:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, featuring a candle for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing attraction to the county.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone support and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura and salmon is cheated, a popular Topping, which is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "Wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic bags can also receive a less appetizing form, for example, colleagues or family members unpleasantly too.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice cream.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also Rice balls (onigiri), Earrings and molybdeners from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other skinned plastic dishes can be found under: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # Three-tubbing.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trends, this video gives you an insight into the Kappabashi district, which is dedicated to the shale of the restaurant industry. for example, with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="744">The following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually made.</seg>
<seg id="745">A Mexican project tells stories of survivors of the struggle against organised crime</seg>
<seg id="746">"for the victims of fighting against drug dealers."</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious "fight against drug dealers" in Mexico, the demists and killed regularly occur in statistics. however, this reflects the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings with itself.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reporting of drug bosses like El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, pressed the stories of the conflict completely in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the mourning or the communes that have learned to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each body, behind each bone, in the centuries secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">Therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico has created the digital project "Aprentia Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with the drug trade), the victims should give a voice and tells stories of people who were involved in the struggle between law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime cannot only fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The implications are much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if shops close, because they are threatened by drug dealers and all municipalities need to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">Pain of victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "a video entitled" "" "Vidas que cambian por el miedo" "" "(german:" "" "how fearful life" "" ") tells about these stories." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who is looking for secret tombs after his son.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta RodrÃ­guez who lost their father's four sisters, her husband and two brothers.</seg>
<seg id="762">Priest: "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves back the task again today, which we have asked us to go, and after the tombs we have loved to look for."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in a power business in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On October 13th he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">On October 15th he would be back again, but he never came again. Emma Veleta: "it's very hard for me because I am now alone with three children who need a training.</seg>
<seg id="769">There is also my mother, who is here with me.</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment they have no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">You are standing by my father's insurance, but they don't pay them out because they require a death certificate.</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get that? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a Vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We must not only show the faces of those who imagine fear. we have to show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the sovereign power.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories by readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some extracts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this contribution from Taxco, in the federal state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that men should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have already known illness and sensations for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I am passing through newspaper kiosks and see the cover pages with pictures, which actually can only come from a textbook for criminology or from acquiring specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one I've got or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10 year old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealers) if it is great. and it is also not normal that people can hear songs about the "helpers" of offenders when they walk through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is, as if they have lost those who have lost someone, and those who are afraid that something happens to them as well.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories are being exposed to naked numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the inaction of people is unbelievable for me if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students are justified in a neighboring village that they were" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they're trying to talk, that they have spared themselves of such tragedies if they are not stirring and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months of blackmail in the main city district:" it describes how an armed statutory month for month money was pressed by their business until they had not only destroyed the business, but also their families torn apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you lost, and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">Pain never goes away, the sadness remains, the fear comes up again, if you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We just contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The more we are removed, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because they don't know when they will take you or kill.</seg>
<seg id="798">I was asked in these horrible days whether wines my profound feelings would dissolve, but the answers is no, because I forgot how to weep. I need to learn how to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">Journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the contribution "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a Generation of Violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">What is it like to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a Waise and he tells that he had to teach himself, how to make an egg cooks, potatoes brushes, tortillas warm, and "Chichi" for the babies that dwell with him. this is his name for the preparation of flacon with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother would have disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day that his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was already past two years earlier, when he was just a few blocks away from his home, the bloody suffering of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, as violence caused by the organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Council of Public Safety and the Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor called 3103 murders. this equates to average 8.5 Morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are only a few hundreds of thousands of stories that organised the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories are still living in the face of new headlines. but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprentia Vivir Con El Narco," animal PolÃ­tico has set up the data journalism project Narcodata in 2015, whose goal is to depict the complex information behind the failed fighting against drug dealers, who has tormented the country in the past four decades.</seg>

<seg id="818">The factor check is important in a moment where it is about to take out a rumor or to create a fake.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the years after having appeared the first time? content in social media, whether it's true or true, tends to exist further.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release, it has been used misleading, tragedies that have occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false Coupling of Image and Event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - denies not the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting on events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desires to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker stirred up the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, kippte and exploded. 230 people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="826">After civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected and devastated. the streets in the region have become scarceful treads, which were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank of tanker fell victim.</seg>
<seg id="828">Mastering representatives described a fireball, dozens of houses, including a movie theaters, which was full of people that illustrate the football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses dispersed and stolen bodies were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to the godliness.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "This is Nigeria." from the Imgur users Mystic Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident make the grey scenes this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">There are rows of knotted bodies attached to the ground, while they have a look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story is not its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo has been recorded several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but not to be attributed to the tragedies, in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, the Boko Haram attacked the dragonan towns of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Witnesses reported drastically of atrocities, in which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and carcases were burned down in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">But the numbers could not be confirmed. "no one remained back to count bodies," said a inhabitant to Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were crushed, shot or burnt.</seg>
<seg id="843">The follow-up time could only be displayed only from satellite images.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unexplained, but the conservation status in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram to win country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo appeared back when it was wrongly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place in Paris for two days.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this mischievous use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of abortions; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was taken as a proof for Massages.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further bring personal comments such as this example, from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in relation to supply arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange was also in connection with the fatal persecution of the Muslim coingya in Myanmar in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash message, published by the United Nations, those who could flee could hit strokes, rape and some dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported the violence against the Rohingya, according to the following, the following descriptions brought together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from a Saudi Arabian news page, which was falsely claimed that President Myanmars Tha has said that monks and politicians were involved in the assassination of the Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to educate this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original contribution will be accessed on April 26, 2017, and can be accessed here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news organizations running AFP than their source, had wrongly attributed to Thought His testimony, but did not allow the image of the DR Congo in connection.</seg>
<seg id="859">The world wide range of false information</seg>
<seg id="860">Traces of these false clutations go back to the years 2011 and 2012, and actually come from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">Using a "reverse image search" you can see how far information can cross borders.</seg>
<seg id="862">A reverse picture search with the search engine TinEye has found 344 at 18.8 billion images (as of May 3, 2017) 344 images which are very similar to the mentioned picture of the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They come from a mixer, private parties, platforms of social media and community and national publications and are available in many different languages such as English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>
<seg id="864">Some have been forwarded to false reports, others tried to unmasks the counterfeits.</seg>
<seg id="865">We have submitted examples of abused use and brought them into connection with the respective countries, based on what site they have been published. thus, we want to represent the reach more clearly than by the language alone.</seg>
<seg id="866">Several examples of misuse are used from the listed countries (which are also linked in some cases).</seg>

<seg id="909">This news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Thought has been granted in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims and brought the story with the image from Sange.</seg>
<seg id="910">The article was updated in 2014 and this release is still included in this publication.</seg>
<seg id="911">Spain, 2015 / 2016.</seg>
<seg id="912">This article from 2014 about students who have been killed by the Boko Haram, published by the Catholic Church of AnÃ¡lisis Digital, has explicitly stated that the image is not taken from the killings, but it claims that it was a "similar dattst attack."</seg>
<seg id="913">As the picture later in connection with the massacre of Boko Haram in circulation in 2015, the newspaper El Pais tried to refute that there were links to Nigeria.</seg>

<seg id="915">The picture of the DR Congo met with this Twitterhashtag, and dissolved a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of Boko Haram 2015 and Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve that their communities took these events that were alleged in the name of the Islams, a greater attention.</seg>
<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture has been tagged as proof of the Boko Haram massacre of 2015 (and more than 9,300 times saved), but the messages that were associated with it were not adopted in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the goal of preparing attention to the relative number of dead and a comparison of media coverage in the comparison of Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (Vietnamese), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message that was supposed to have been written by a "Father Juan Carlos Martos - written about the Nigerian massacres, there were some discussion forums on Vietnamese and declared it to counterfeit.</seg>
<seg id="922">From the message in which the picture was included from the DR Congo, the organisation of the Claretine missionaries and Fr Juan Carlos Martos are distressed.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (irradiation) that go through these posts. the first frame is focused on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to larger discussions about the silence on the silence of Christians through Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the assassinations of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second Framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued as a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion can understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth to examine how pictures are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens if readers cannot give these pictures longer faith.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are poor people who have unintentionally concerned about drinking water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this mood of mischief and misinformation that actual atrocities are untrue and tasted the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of nonviolent images has been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that it returns from pictures of a refusal to recognise the tragedy. sometimes these pictures even demands by the victims himself.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time concern, concern that violent images of readers and audience desensizing and to them the ability to empathy empathy (such as this study, who sought how violent media seem to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there are some more violent representations in the news media, the fact that it is essential for today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experiment with algorithms to support the struggle against "Fake News." you will find thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something suggests, but it can be used completely from context or fully abused manner.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name of untranslatable (e.g. inexaggerated) strives to offer language enthusiastic a selection of words from all over the world, which are difficult, or not to be translated.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are such words in each language: you press some situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unnecessary words are already well-known (like the famous Portuguese Saudade) and others that are rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sojouresa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">One word or expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a bit context are required to understand what this word is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists cover Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and Linguist from "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find some words from Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Bemba to get your parents in recognition, as for your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsq language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The comfort or laziness that you feel after being warmed up in cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds own words in his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They derives other cultures, reveal other thoughts and wake up our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence the world around us and classify the Linguists on this page still want to publish and show more of these "unnecessary" words and show how different, valuable, and impressive to these small languages.</seg>

<seg id="1004">They were muslified me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't see all the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves to be Muslim, in different art. but somehow we are all plugged into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is well designed in our collective idea that as soon as Muslims do not fit there, be muscled.</seg>
<seg id="1010">Discharge processes are being discharged</seg>

<seg id="1016">When Jalaluddin Rumi was so old as I was now, he was an Orthodox Muslim preacher and scholar.</seg>
<seg id="1017">Islam, the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died, the center of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But in the western sight, religion was deleted by Rumis as well as from the most popular translations of poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deletion makes a large proportion of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world.</seg>
<seg id="1020">Another consists in the refractive images of Muslims that encaptivating western books for centuries.</seg>
<seg id="1021">This tempting language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save.</seg>
<seg id="1022">The landmark Palestinian-American scientist Edward Said, in the 1970s, put the story behind these images.</seg>

<seg id="1024">Our politicians, the news industry and Hollywood continue to continue.</seg>
<seg id="1025">I've been working for thirteen years in the news industry and I saw how this powerful, faultless narrative are dominating our newsfeeds.</seg>
<seg id="1026">This narrative is the reality that nine Muslim women have led their countries during the last three decades, while the USA could not even choose their first female Presidential candidate in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognise that if French, Muslim women are inhibited to carry their headscarf in public buildings and to cover Saudi Arab, Muslim women through their government to cover the entire body, which are both two sides of the same coin.</seg>

<seg id="1032">This narrative is communicated deeply and incorrect that often Sikh-men and children become the target of stimulus attacks and chicanings.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell it is Islamophobia today not only fear of Islam, religion, but it is fear of the "others."</seg>
<seg id="1034">To the 1.7 billion belong</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the news industry we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Or on alternative facts.</seg>
<seg id="1037">We also do Narrative, who help us understand the world.</seg>
<seg id="1038">And my industry has failed to capture the narrative of 1.7 billion.</seg>
<seg id="1039">And we have failed here, where seven million Muslims comprise the highest degree of "religious group in America."</seg>

<seg id="1050">We also have to be no theological experts to be "Muslim" or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="1051">There are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars, Muslim activists and interreligious activists who endeavoured to fight widespread lies over Islam.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These lies are produced on the current band by a well-adorned Islamophobia, think tanks and experts for counterfeit information, which is already a flawed picture of what a Muslim is; or what Islam is, manipulated.</seg>

<seg id="1123">I am worried about the realities and history I was not aware when I was so old as it is now my daughter, but who made me today a sudden Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Things I have left here like a breadlane in my speech.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Things that are perhaps recollections, because in all the intersecctions that make our humanity, likes a story, where someone is made to "others."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Right now, on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley, conversation takes place within the 8th Annual Meeting of Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="1127">More than one hundred academician speak about our problems with the "other," structural racism "and" American militarism. "</seg>
<seg id="1128">But these are no terms with which we throw in our schools to us or we read in our newspapers.</seg>

<seg id="1130">We all need to ask ourselves why?</seg>
<seg id="1131">Why don't I tell you here at this TEDx Talk 2017 in Stanford, where Edward Said, the man who has shown us how wars are led and people by creating the "other" in public presentation, four decades ago Scientific of Stanford was.</seg>
<seg id="1132">We have to do uncomfortable questions according to the role of its, consciously and unconsciously living the "other"; as it is my girlfriend and I present in the rain during the Women's March, because the employment is that we have no president, the chocolate cake, while already chutte countries and "to other made" people are bombed, goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>
<seg id="1133">It starts here with all of us.</seg>
<seg id="1134">The initiative of storytale wants to preserve urban diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Storyteller count, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, under the use of the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility, here and now, despite a language barrier with someone in connection?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the creator of stories in their original language is a possible response.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the Untranslated blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not written on the written word, but on the spoken word. it concerns a try to obtain the language variety of great cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland, in the United States, where TLS has already conducted events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages does not exist to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project is:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world can be avoided, if we create cities, accept diversity - secure rooms, in which inhabitants don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listen often often to understand" "" "these events instead of listening to" "" "listening to feel" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers represent their story first in their own language and translate or explain to English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and their representation make sure the listener makes it possible.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions as the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round the storyteller Rassidatou conuses the opportunity to explain the story of typical customs of storytelling.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the beak of the rabbit and the poavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his beak, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is this to speak to a audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a wide grinsen he shares his feeling of included:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You've listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organisers hope to expand this. all who are inspired by the project, can organise with TLS in order to organize their own history events.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico calls for the US revival of sovereign debt</seg>
<seg id="1155">With the aim of a new audit in Puerto Rico, which has risen to 72 million US dollars, on the past 3rd April 2017, various religious and bourgeois organisations involved in a mass demonstration; the march was launched at the puertorific Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went down to the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the Old Town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la Deuda" (civil front for the neurotation of debts) and the Okomenian church of Puerto Ros.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The intercession of the repetition of the new debts also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Ros calls for politicians, bankers and government agencies who have been responsible for debt for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We call for financial inspection and a tap committee without personal interests on public debt, with a firm, our working conditions, remuneration that is active in favor of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We will be pressed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Ros refuses to pay a debt that is not their.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be found with sincous retirement payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate measures.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not integrated in the national territory of the United States - suffers from a heavy financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Therefore, the so-called "Center for New Economy," a non-governmental non-profit organization, without affiliation with focus on the socio-economic development, a law governing government responsibility as an alternative to the existing state recognition.</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ros requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">On the outside, measures are imposed without the participation and conviction of the citizens of danger, rejected by the people.</seg>
<seg id="1171">The demonstration carried the name "night watch for light and truth."</seg>

<seg id="1180">Bassel Safadi and his wife Noura.</seg>
<seg id="1181">Photo of the Facebooksite of Noura Ghazi Safadi.</seg>
<seg id="1182">The syrically Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi is missed since over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives filed the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions which he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: PUBLICA, the annual conference on digital culture that will be held in Berlin, devoted an event of the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the German-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, Managing Director of Book Sprints, a publishing house produced by so-called 'Book Sprints', has produced excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inner (The Cost of Freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book that has been published last year and is licensed here, contains a number of approaches to deal with the free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss, such as movements for free knowledge, and what are the real cost, with which this is linked.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and writers who have involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked on side to view over the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create something from our different experience.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to liberate Bassel Khartabil, who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was knitted from the Adra prison directory, in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about its present state or position.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory section of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom, and instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us begin to think about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What did we give up extreme beliefs in this process?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer of Open Source and Digital activites has been in custody for Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment, to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the military police Bassel had taken on the basis of a "strictly secret" command of the Military Tribunal in Adra.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted by persons on November 12, 2015, who presented themselves as the Insider of the Assad government and put them by an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His residence and condition continues to remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer in Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a decisive role in implementing access to the Internet and to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist, and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project that Bassel established, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of the bass-cultural prototypes was perhaps more excited than the work which he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the wayside of many civilizations and the Greek-Roman architectural types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he began with this work, the IS would put everything to it, this architecture that is not only embodied by the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strike in the digital archaeology and conservation has created a timcapsule, which will be invaluable for the public as well as scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not stop this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband, his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life with it, dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English, even when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he taught other imprisoned, to write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened me the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other imprisoned men, as they use computers, at least in theory, without having actually held one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten auf), a profiling that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015, when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together for a year together in the book.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She dingy the lyrics to him, when she visited him, and he translated it from the Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is licensed free.</seg>

<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title "It is happening":</seg>
<seg id="1228">It happens at every visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That in the world I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose the spinning in the moment, in which we embrace us,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That every creature doesn't care for me,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, shackles, and watchmen</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the prison sentence</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I penetrate into every detail of your voice and words.</seg>
<seg id="1235">Which I carry with passion for myself,</seg>
<seg id="1236">When your eyes say goodbye</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I will leave another piece of my soul with you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">I return soon to my loneliness,</seg>
<seg id="1239">To get all the moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And about your absence to weep and to smile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I bear witness to myself, that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">On the first anniversary of Bassel's arrest, Ghazi wrote:</seg>
<seg id="1243">One year goes, my soul</seg>
<seg id="1244">While on</seg>
<seg id="1245">I am in your cage,</seg>
<seg id="1246">And you're still in the cage of the monsters</seg>
<seg id="1247">Bassels story is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Since the protests in 2011 against the regime's Bashar al-Assad's regime, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian National Human Rights), more than 65.000 people disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or arrested by violence through the regime were tortured or executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Until 2016, Amnesty International has died at least 17.723 Syrians in detention since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people are unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">Since 2012 the Global Voices Community requests the release of Bassel.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Today, we repeat our demand for the hope that we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mosambik: convicted of corruption on arrest due to corruption</seg>
<seg id="1255">At the end of his sentence, Mozambique responded to a corruption incident in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state machine, on which corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This deals with Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010, together with four other defendants, were sentenced to 22 years in prison for failure to be sentenced to 22 years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public money at the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately requested his re-setting to the company, which happened on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a position of the General Prosecutor's Attorney General of the Republic, it would not be an obstacle reason for Cambaza to regain his old position as the company had not moved into custody after his incarceration.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many citizens do not have the action good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, just CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned in an interview with the German Wave, the decision of the company to address the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a setback in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a backstep in terms of the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we have to know is that the company should have a disciplinarian procedure against the assurances.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company appears to be silent, however, and prompted no appropriate legal steps to the application of the appropriate functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, rejects this behavior as well as to be "contrasting":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type, he would be an advisor after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had served.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid speeches and motivating speeches, he might advise and polishing his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he consented to be reintegrated into the company which he helped to inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently, it is obvious: Cambaza will gladly pay for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradically!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young mosambitions and student of political science in Brazil says the director would have no morals:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza of the state rewarded because he rewarded him, I can't believe someone has rewarded someone such a way that massively insulted the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the morality and serve the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but has only served himself on the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">The state of Cambaza used the state when handsome it became an inexhaustible money source and the state itself was tired of this man and was finally condemned to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel to remember that a thief belongs to prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the Samora Machel prison will not only remain as the first independent president in memory, but also as a sharp, single-cut and - by the way - Prophetic Redner.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations, being energetic, confirmed that "an ambitious man was able to sell his own interest to his ambitions, his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora said: "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that this is not so. he changes the tactics, but he does not turn from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious person is criminal. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also leaning:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, he sat down 10 years and was released.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today the company relies on him when he was involved with the promise of money, again under the contract. # AssimVaiOMeuPais - ÑÎ±divers types (@ azzy _ Rafik) May 12, 2017</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook is blocking the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users.</seg>
<seg id="1287">The burial word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or spheres.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to data from Facebook users in Myanmar, the known Social Network took their links out of the net because they contained the word "Kalar."</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although more about the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is normally used to reject people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censored the word "Kalar" or tubbing the tubings (in burial script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread issue of hate-language in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the Ascension has been radically nationalist movements to the word an extremely complete connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as Hassam against Muslims, who constitute a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight it in Myanmar in Myanmar, the company used a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may usually be associated with racism today, but the word itself is not automatically called Hasselt.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also Posts in which they have discussed the use of the Word or have doubts about his use, censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Furthermore, there are several burial words with basic meanings that have the same letter as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (spires), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'calcaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookuser Aung Kaung Myat explained the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was deleted today, because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends on a spiritual way whether they could have kissed his back pain, as he did a word game.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The Set ku la - "Healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hats is the opinion that it should be more radically more radically nationalists, but also emphasised that Facebook needs to be analytic before it deletes all trophies to spread racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you are writing on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What to do instead is to analyse the mail carefully and control it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (spheres).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these trickly nationalists who distribute hate-language, receive a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it's time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action is sending a strong signal to all that hate them, the efficiency of this strategy may not keep long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of striking words often get a catching and mouse game, with the user of social networks simply start to use a new word or an alternative writing of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how facebook started to delete his post when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banned by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was aware of this new directive on Facebook, I made a post office to join my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post office was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to sign posts and sharing of content for 24 hours, because the post office "didn't disappoint the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a wide variety of people removed from people who have no negative intentions, or just try to show their opinions against the hate radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with Hasselt:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook is removed.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post office the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes Facebook should have done more before the initiative of the initiative, for example, the Burmese Internet community for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words can be censored only more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it appears as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned words like "chair" or "peas curry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out they made mistakes, they did not attempt to rectify the wrongally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits, they claim to be a great turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has provided a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun and write the word 'Kalar' in the context of Hasslanguage to see if their links are taken from the web.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots from Facebook-Posts, which have no Hasslanguage, but still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and watch peas curry and see an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try out whether Facebook contains the mail, which contains the word Kalar. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"" "the post says" If you're a doctor, do you cure people? "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks have increased to extend their voices and their influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, an addiction in social networks can also preheat the violence in the congregations in Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine area where thousands of Muslims and Buddhists forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for his failure to talk to his burial sites on his burmese pages.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather than to shift the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look rather in context than on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The children's love is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the Parliament of the country unanimously adopted a law which is to offer this practice, so that the appropriate age is 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Before this change of the adulterer held several members of duistic and Muslim religious communities in practice, and in May 2016 brother Harrypersad Maharaj said that the state should not interfere with the interreligious groups of the country, that the state should not interfere with the age that does not determine the maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened, regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contracting partner of the UN children's rights, the minors as, to every man under the age of 18.</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who have already been married to 15, Trinidad and Tobago was 2.8 percent, and with 18 were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's statistical system confirmed that of 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitioning and social media movements which endeavours to abolish laws on children's before, followed at the foot and rejoiced in great support. undoubtedly helped them to bring this outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, nothing went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu leaders, for example, had no concerns to say the critics of the children's love, they should be condemned to take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition forged tension in this really complicated matter, and sometime came to doubt whether the opposition would agree to the bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017 the bill was voted against the children's before - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent that could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must agree and proclaim the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's stations gave a status update on Facebook which has re-read Leslie-Ann Boiselle at Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill of draft law was voted on the House of Representatives with 35 votes for it and not only.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After having previously decided in the Senate, the draft may now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media user was thrilled, because the laws have finally been changed to children's love.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Dear Francis, a member of the ministry of office in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It's all too much time and unnecessary odor needed, which has polluted the core of the matter but do you know what? the children's love is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now is worth every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson was the opinion that it was definitely enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was happy that the day finally arrived:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public Update status on Facebook from Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says: News, Excellent News!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The marriage law has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, voices - 35 it - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, which belongs to Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society, which was quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The appropriate age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of religious affiliation 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft on the change of the marriage network today, on June 9, 2017, decided.</seg>
<seg id="1368">In the House of Representatives, there are 41 members in the House of Representatives and 35 of them were present in the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All the members who were against have agreed to the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The children's love is legally allowed in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long fight (...) # childmarriagefish.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all activists who have imagined him.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A Thank you to our MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook is in the form of Sat Maharaj, therefore, the Secretary-General of Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Prior to months, Maharaj has announced his intention to take judicial steps, the law should be adopted, and he seems to resolve his promise now.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the Attorney General of Paris, Al-wi, a disadvocate of the law, said it was wrong if Maharaj wanted to go against the law, the most social media users were desirable to address the debate on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we are taking place to talk about the debate so general, in a way that we would like to invite the state into our bedroom, "just to protect themselves, that the state, our daughters, may protect them from large, hard-infected men who are misused to them, would you be willing to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where the child is legal or even the norm, though there are laws prohibiting them.</seg>

<seg id="1390">Through the spider of websites, Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again</seg>
<seg id="1391">The English-speaking Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012, on the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States, internationally.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month, Turkey has closed the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day for day is clear how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series resist the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many techniques used to use Internet users to use blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence of the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users are not falling in this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has closed articles from Wikipedia since 2008, just as recently published in an published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University has been reported to find regular blockages of the Internet since 2007, after the Internet law (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship on Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains closed, there are now several mirrors (pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are often being updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the interPlanetary File System), when the platform was based on all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. calculator calculator), which is not based on the system of domain names, thus making a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">However, the content is available despite a legislative prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post IPFS report on his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the messages (via the locking of Wikipedia), we put everything to locate snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, the possibility to read content on decentralized and distributed fashion.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This allows users to help at least all Wikipedia content even if they can't reach the site www.wikipedia.org yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was performed independently from the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to avoid the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedic.org, a Mirrorside of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to hoist similar Mirrorsites when it is locked out in the country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices as well as staff at Mozilla in Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Access to another URL, which is not the original thing. that what one sees then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially the server directs the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia for yourself if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is done by a server, which is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos he saw around, never satisfied. they were blurred with poorly positioned motives and balanced colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">The motivated him have a camera to wear and try to bury the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar, Neptune strives to bring to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his home village next to Chitwan National Park, it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that direct attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described Facebook how to help him this top-class location in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world heritage. what could there be better for a passionate game photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I rested not at home when suddenly Navaraj (the Manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that a Leopard would be on the banks of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river Dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes there.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me the place on the other river, where the Leopard was located and I immediately started to knead images!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar is seeking a collaboration with the authorities to achieve the worldwide recognition of Nepals Nature and would like to deepening the understanding that wild animals are not so frightening as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, because he stood at the presence of face toward the presence:</seg>
<seg id="1430">Tiger can not disturb oneself from the opinion of sheep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">I was also because of the dark on the way home, when suddenly the King of the Buheke appeared. he immediately turns away, we look forward and he stared me through the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) to his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepals nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and lived in a tent in order to take pictures of Otters. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger, and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near tourist information.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanova and was originally published on video Volunteers, an award-winning international community organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version has been published here as part of a content-sharing Convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women avoid women with great care, to address the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, they use a pronouns or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women admit that they should respect the husband due to the social pressure of the husband, as well as the fear of the consequences, they should imitate the norm to maintain this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was condemned by the Indian state of Othera by a pseudostem and expel by their family and the village community after she had addressed a dedicated relations with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of tradition not call their wives by name is also spread among men. however, they have far fewer assignments to fear, if ever, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including healthcare personnel and housewives, became a unique club and thus became fast to the main themes of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place for them alone, to discuss and discuss the qualities of patriarchism.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states it is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, operated by the community video Volunteers and sets itself for the removal of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas working for seven years with the help of their video camera to the discovery of practices, such as children's home to the association of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and leads these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports about how these clubs were created a safe place for these women and made them at the same time as the shaft inside of the wall.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, which showed Rohini in its discussion round, acted by women who don't call their husbands at the name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this issue because she wanted to open the talk about the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to pronounce the names of their husbands, a Brine, which they are all condemned to agree, and never questioned him.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition tells us that a woman respects her husband and wishes to give him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who doesn't hold this, is regarded as a postponent, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never made thought about this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who never had called her husband, had never known her husband at home, as it runs at home.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband were silent for a long time, after the video was finished.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "" "" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should call him by name now." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started with this self-confidence in the luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, were protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After video projection, the women tried to bring discussion with a exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, annoys, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked them all, "If we cannot say the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want us, means that they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day that they brought the name of their husbands on the lips," says Rohini Pawas of the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the breaking of a centuries-old tradition in which married women would never be able to pronounce their husbands "name.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that during the whole exercise just stood up, another one decided to release the whole frustration against him and to release his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Nor in adrenaline frenders, to have broken with an ancient torso, the women decided that they could actually try home their husbands in their name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days Rohini received a lot of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put in the head: his wife could not stop to say his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law-law hiked them, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini said I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The husband of an attendance was less understandable and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as the carrying of the zinnoberred point on the forehead that shows the marriage status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would carry the zinnoberred point if he would do it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only, and I listened to him to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not finished completely, but mean they are now in a better position, even to choose to wear it in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the Discussion lub is a safer place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we do a trip at every discussion verb." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we packed lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want to take care of those who could hear, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months she celebrated her own birthdays with cakes for the first time in her life. they danced and talked about things about which they never had thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have been thinking about some things, for example, like our identities to our husbands, have never been so honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to tell certain things loudly, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we have maintained about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of them is okay, but some wanted to bear a Salwas-Kurta, a wide shirt over a trousers, they did not have a weeds.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After many dispute and discussion on the advantages of their own coat-choice, morals linked with the Saris and much more, dingggelded Rohini their own pair of courtas (Oberhemden) in a discussion round, so that the women could bear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they now have decided to plan an excursion to Goa in which they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question, if in the five months have changed a bit, Rohini confirmed that things are slowly getting into the rolling:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We only have taken little steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women try a few times, but then they stopped to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including myself, make it still, but only if they are alone and no other family members are there.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two will continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women can now wear Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in Discussion lub know that the changes they would like to achieve in their lives - like the Feilles for more motion freedom or their own coat-choice - at the end of a hard to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also there.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives everyone the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction, if any woman goes home in the club and other people talk about what we're talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the video Volunteers community come from marginalised groups in India and make videos of stories about which is not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">These stories are "messages of those who want to experience themselves," and offer a hyperlocal context to report on global human rights and development needs.</seg>

<seg id="1550">The Beatles visit in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a downturn in the Japanese culture of post-war years.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who interviewed the Beatles in London in 1964, noted on the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just under five days the Beatles were in the country, but this has been enough to turn the Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The people here is quite quickly clear that they had no other choice when the Beatles have received open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many famous Japanese sizes had reached its zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," Ryuichi Isaka, President of the retail price of Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning!! today the Beatles of the Beatles began in Japan. an average of 51 years ago they were here in Tokyo.</seg>

<seg id="1560">We all love in our house the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1561">I don't know if this "Winnie the Pooh" puppet John Lennon should be present or not.</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it belongs to fans, Japanese naturally also make pilgrimages to the well-known places that are related to the band.</seg>

<seg id="1591">Another group, the aim of assassinations for obscure purposes are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN 2016 passed a mission in SA to investigate these practices.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of Southern Africa, especially in neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably recently made.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of prisoned Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo had caught attention in the international community, after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer in the terminal stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison for "Subversion" (State Investigation), after referring to the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that the democratic reforms in China had requested.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The State Department in China referred to Lius Fall as "an internal matter" and narrated a speaker, he considered it as "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">However, China will continue to call calls from the international community, Nobel laureates and his wife, poet, Liu Xia, or to allow him a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely pronounced on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summed up some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss Liu's case.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a speaker refused to comment, whether the United Nations should exert pressure to enable Liu abroad a treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende refused to answer questions about Lius.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway was moved to the Stocks, after the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government settled there was nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. in June Norway, Norway signed an agreement to regain salmon committees since 2010, because the exports had been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee brought his hope for a conditional release and called Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his detention, he was not able to oppose his award.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament passed a decision to liberate Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The peak of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for the release of China for the release of Lius as announced on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect to raise all limitations of Mr Lius's wife as well as family members.</seg>

<seg id="1652">U.S. ambassador Terry Branstad told that Americans knew him that he has the possibility to treat abroad, as if it is possible to help him. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">An spokesperson for the US embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the news agency AFP on June 27 that the message would release the Chinese authorities, not only Liu, but also his wife Ms. Liu Xia from their house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the request of the US embassy drew a raging response from China to themselves, with the utterance of the State Department that" "" "no country has the right to participate in and unanswer comments on Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley shared with that China should offer the married couple:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, including travel access and access to the medical care of its choice, which they have according to Chinese constitution and legal system and international commitments.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to impose Liu and his wife unconditional.</seg>
<seg id="1658">I urge China to release the Nobel Laureate # LiuXiaobo unconditional, so that he can carry himself in a proper medical treatment. http: / / bit.ly / 2tE6kUo</seg>

<seg id="1660">The German government spokesman Steffen Seibert wrote on July 3, Berlin that Liu explains all the medical support he needs "and that a" humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority. "</seg>
<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping was published on July 7 and 8th at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing reported that China had huge concerns whether the turbulence could oversaw the visit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, the Canadian ambassador John McCallum invited China to provide a reasonable medical care and give him the opportunity to provide himself from his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius lawyer told AFP that Lius wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed to talk to anyone including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells about:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls on China to maintain its international human rights violations, including freedom of expression, and for exercising these rights prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France</seg>
<seg id="1669">On 29 June, the Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs called for China on 29 June to release Liu from humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo will receive all treatments that he, regardless of where, needs. furthermore, his wife and his family may contact him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news conference on France has already reported that the French government of Liu was welcome in the country, the State Department announced that France could not find any further information if France would eventually receive him.</seg>

<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislature from the ruling Democratic Progress Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed himself in a statement on June 28 around Liu very concerned and asked that many have asked him to pray for Lius wellbeing.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my faith that the initiatives he took, and for whom he had been strictly punished, led to a harmonious, stable, and wealthy China, which in turn had contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt personally moved and encouraged, when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, the Charter 08 signed the Charter 08 who stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or countryside?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on occasion of the meeting of the international branch of the law of the State of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore, because they are compared to Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">It supports that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has asked whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people get a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are no country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog of Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice, "rejected the logic" to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this valuable land, you can say that we could not be any country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the certificate of a flight before the responsibilities, a mandatory injury.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very noble: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal lands', in view of its, he appeared inevitably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">However, by contrast, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core point of the subject, the good old surrounds of the Authors Machines will be resurrected by the authoritative figures, leaving the Democrats, where it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end the last week of Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judicial authorities, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He tarried appropriate questions with non-Answers.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng asks Shanmugam to demonstrate his mind, as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">When Singapore is not a country but a city is, so to which country our city belongs to...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful if our werter K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point where it was paid up to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By taking on his comment on the blog, he points out his comment on the critics that you should start to read the entire recording of the conference, so that one can understand the context of Shanmugam better, according to that Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the script.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said that Singapore is rather a "city" as a country, "he explained why the elections in Singapore were so unimportant, even if we are looking forward to free and fair elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He moved to Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities were watching a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">When he said, Singapore was no country, "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment of Shanmugam, who, as leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am talking about what the Minister of Justice has said of Singapore, I am very promising...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Guard, which I expected - would I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even certain whether he really believes that he really believes that he defended.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review sets the vulnerabilities of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr. Shanmugam "benign an error," or was it a free speaker?</seg>
<seg id="1720">When Singapore is not a country, we are considered independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which country go back the sovereign rights of the city to Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it's equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government statement, the testimony of Mr Shanmugam are of severe importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why are the people of Singapur of their military service, do they defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who has to pay our Prime Minister invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country, or inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">To the publication of the Journey of a Decade for affirmation, Singapore is and always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I didn't say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This proposition seems to have annoyed a lot of Singapur...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a city / island nation.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"" "I can understand that we often hear statements such as" "" "the defence of the country especially" "", "but that is not quite right." ""</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather talk about the defence of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1736">The Myth of the "nice Canadian"</seg>
<seg id="1737">Canadian Ned Flanders.</seg>
<seg id="1738">Screenshot from a YouTube video.</seg>
<seg id="1739">Global Voices asked for his editors: what is the most abducted aspect of your home or homeland?</seg>
<seg id="1740">Their answers will be published here as part of a continued series, with the rumours of certain parts of the world, and another facets will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">"" "the question I am most asked in Japan is:" are you Americans? "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1743">"" "" "" "no, I'm sorry," "" "I answer." "" "I'm from Canada." "" "since 1994 I live and again in Japan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on what situation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in its talk partner by making personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">Then in my clarification follows the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, Nature." many Canadians are perhaps inwardly especially anger if they are held for Americans, but does not disturb me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know himself, there is little to distinguish us Canadians of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians spend a Canadian flag in their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">By contrast, Americans are....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was, when I began 20 years ago, through the world - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always worn little maple blades in their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free healthcare!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There are no weapons with us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Gay marriage are legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">All seem to think, Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We obviously say very often "apology."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is also considered to be the tolerant country against ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not like these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I have many American friends I admire very much.</seg>
<seg id="1763">It would make me nothing, if you were changing me from Dallas, for example.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc out of Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">Firstly, as "nice" signifies, in essence, to be spun - as the goodnatured, gentle, but tragically, unsignificant figure Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (which has one's own Canadian DoppelgÃ¤nger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really had a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing at which one can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">To be harmless, unobtrusive, and not to earn attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good, if you go unnoticed in the background, away from the things that pass around.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go as far as to say that the desire, free and to be alone, is the main character of Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outside as "nice," is perhaps just cool politeness.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't talk about the fence about the fence.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We lacks the warm hearty, open kindness, which I now connect with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Fortunately for us (and for the rest of the world), Justin Trudeau considered the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice." our Prime Minister has almost made Canada.</seg>

<seg id="1780">One in Thailand's famous pop-band has released a music video that seized the Junta in 2014 and restore power in spite of its promises to restore the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the Tattoo Colour is describing a young man who tells of that his girlfriend makes his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not politically, the music video refers to the continued military power of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage, to describe the situation in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video for song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Within the first three days, the video was posted on Facebook highly charged video 1.254 times and received 8,800 Likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, even the Charlie Chaplin-Video "Der dictator" was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists united the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, inspecial, as it is the situation of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Check out these recordings of the videos that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand have pursued in the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"" "the" "" "44 rules of girls" "" "possibly refer to the draconian section 44 of the provisional constitution which is granted the commander-in-chief of the military absolute decision on important national topics." ""</seg>
<seg id="1790">"" "the 11th rule:" "" "change your attitude" "" "refers to the notorious program for the" "" "installation change" "" "by journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are considered a critic of the Junta." ""</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was also set up in the army which monitors online content and persons accused of having slandered the monarchy, prosecute the criminal law.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand sets a strict companion against "Lese Majeste" (Majestic).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, the war was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the junta continues to buy, is their decision to buy expensive U-boats, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of control systems.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video it will even show how people are thrown into a black delivery van before being put into an intermediate camp, another problem.</seg>

<seg id="1805">It has now been over 20 years since the Georgian-Abchasal war officially ended, but his scars are still visible in this part of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of northern districts in Tkuarchal show markedly images.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages such as Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharchilava are located in the coal basin of Abchasien.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups like Russians, Greeks, parasies, Georgians and Armenians lived and worked as Soviet times in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, the largest part of Russians and Abchases live in the area.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, some places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, he is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year old Mexicanerin, a small woman with a coral pink Brillenframe and gold-colored earrings in teddy form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. yet they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it is) become a target for Africans and Haitians that are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel doesn't have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For approximately 2.50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with bare, crumbled walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom, there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian migrants coming here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells us, people come into full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call: "mum Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you in Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it's more quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez has received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept outside on board.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She helps them, and bring them to the hospital if they are ill, they buy them medications that they could not pay, they massage them with a balsam that drew from the long voyage.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived at a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was a fair nickname for Mrs RamÃ­rez.</seg>

<seg id="1920">Very lovingly.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the cordiality of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, hoping to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have been living in Brazil, however, it is for some Africans, who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other directions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and Africans often travel the way together and that Africans already speak on WhatsApp of Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of his companions, Michelet has lived in Brazil and worked as a construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the soccer world championships.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been guest in Mom Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "mom Africa is our mother and we never leave them again," "" "he answered," "" "we will always stay in contact." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells that her guests are often sending text messages when they continued to greet them or to report her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa but their guests have taught them to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only sparking hope for migrants who are travelling through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the town, a cul-sac leads to JesÃºs Valenela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">In this winter, Valenela and his family are taken in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants can be sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on blankets on the ground, but at least they have electricity, washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenela explains that he knows what the guests go through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he tells. "I have experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was referred to as a raid on his work place from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula, comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he had fled in Honduras with his wife and three children in front of people who wanted money, without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, one of the stone, offered it to his roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa, everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the lengths the travellers depend on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has 20 new guests, a majority of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full, but it is also nostalgic, because of those who have gone out.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she blends her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">One of her daughter is with African hair spots that you made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sorry, while she introduces them short.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication equipment in Xinjiang from Twitter users to the tribings.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, a ethnic minority region in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a cell message to install a monitoring app named Jingwang (or "web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">In the message, the app is said to "keep access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities also managed to use the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because they had installed the app shortly after they had installed the app.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police, the app was able to determine the sources and the distribution of the terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the block of pornographic websites, of online fraud, Trojan and phishing pages to make users attentively how much time they spend on online and to control their own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these features can be used, of course, in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could even steal state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal home network's home network.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures relating to the control of digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages about digital censorship in China usually focus on experiencing the experience of users in the east and south, the reality is very often gristerous for those who live in distant ethnic minority regions like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict regions, authorities often arrange extreme tends and surveillance measures, as well as routinemeal Internet abstentions.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media-based media Outlet "Images from Mainland China" (tribbing thunderings), the censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where police reports indiscriminately, if they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure the people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that the people reinstall the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you're discovered at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">That is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use equipment for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by means of waking technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from Mainland China" (bazzy thunderings) also published a Jingwang product description, from which emphasizes that the software can lift the license requirements of a Windows operating system, so that you get unlimited access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installation of Jingwang, computers and cell phones in Xinjiang are available for electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government officials, authorities and party related facilities including universities and research institutions are obligated to follow the instructions of Cybersecurity Office when operating their computers and communications equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A current report by Freedom House, a US-American human rights organization, also mentioned this new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi to register their "personal ID cards, cell phones, external drives, portable HDDs, notebooks, and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>

<seg id="2060">I have used to accustomed it, not to answer.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can really no longer say when insults and punches after a friendly conversation has become a normal communication tool.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how this happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Some voice in me said that I had to accustomed to be punished, although I had done nothing to make this penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2064">At punishment in all their diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to pluck me so much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls the loving "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It begins with a plastic pipe, which probably comes from the cloak.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your Henker rejoices at your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give it a pleasure, you cannot measure it with him, and you cannot keep your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My cry were not enough for him, so why they exchanged the tube through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">During my first arrest, I asked if the investigator had worked as a garbage collector earlier or if it belonged to normal working equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had blocked four cables in each other, in order to present us from their point of view, great invention of a huge cabele.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within a single hour three of them changed while still in the line.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost all this feeling in my body - and my voice is why I heard it cry out.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The Henker noticed the cooling, and found no pleasure in all that he was the next to a electrically charged rod.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity through my whole body, enough to supply my whole quarter.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My semi-naked body, who stretched out on the floor, was the perfect wire leader.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was back again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">That must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep again again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">A few hours passed, which came to me as minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The door opens and the morning light meets the space ".Raus with you, Arschficker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">I reply with the voice of an inexhaustible youth: "my lord, my father must be fearful worrying."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be silent, and get away, you will be moved."</seg>
<seg id="2087">That was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they were always released.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Where do they lead me?!</seg>
<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, free expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photograph was taken from aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of its time indoors; sometimes he smiles at his screen, once to his computer, and again at his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">What you can rely on, is a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house which has been part of them since 1967; the year that Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family had forced to escape from their village in Palestine, where she lived as felahyeen (about: farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years Hdaib has been a passionate active activist, who was transferred to the conservative majority of the conservative majority over gender roles, sexuality and free expression through art and rapeships.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which is often dealt with topics like orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian poultry, he also demands the core of the entire Arab world. all these subjects do not only find relevance in his home town of Amman, but also in cities that stretch from Damascus in Yemen to the whole of Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">In his 25 years, Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not restricted in his thinking through borders, and can be expressed as a loud statement with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he doesn't exist openly, he is a special disagreement against the US-American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones, anything with its identity as "Palestinian poultry of second generation" - so he describes himself, even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think because of my own life circumstances," Hdaib emphasizes.</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so because I am a man, while he was dissolved in water. it is the holy month of Ramadan; it is the Holy month of Ramadan; at that time it is intended for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain inability to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has a little bit of hot jitag little with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the beats lukewarm coffee and the waiter of the Kent-cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the free sky, especially when one throws a look into the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, one avoids it easy to do basic things - as in the public during the Ramadan water - to land not in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Minister Jordaniens had cancelled one appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontship Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert statement.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The Euro MP and former press review of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was cancelled "just" due to the sexual orientation of the scandal.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim also the commitment of the band in matters such as Arab Spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which provides the proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou 'Leila invaded the Jordanian people as a "progressive supporters of human rights" that still has decided to use a intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement might not be easy to be silky rhetoric, but in fact a clearer-crystalline reality reflects Jordan which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work clearly.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib made traditional gender terness to body by having made his vision of the fate of Arabic women that have voiced sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a apparently downworn unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who have actually trusted.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past years, the number of 'Honor' has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of Honor in 2016 reached its climax. however, the institutional infrastructure is missing, however, that Jordan has become institutional infrastructure to support the victims, the victims attempted murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on the interrupting control of the year 1954, women who are exposed to the risk of domestic violence, "in uncertain times in prison," and for their release, often a years of bureaucratic expenditures as well as the guarantee on the family is necessary that the woman is nothing to happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known to be back in front of topics that are long as taboos in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, however, that he is talking about his music, which is full of explicit incentives on sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot separate from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">I was saying to me, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are politically vulnerable within the core.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib released a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, in which one can get what you want "- be it faith or not believe, Hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone speaks in Jordan on the rights of gay and lesbians, and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals still were censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular Jordanian Onlineage program Roya to remember that his comments were torn from the context, twisted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "at Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but was merely a working version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance does not dispromise to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuys, a poet of the eighth century, which still has remained today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuys, who was later to work on behalf of the caliph, in the eighth century, he could not write about homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the show was canceled to do.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemitic kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on the free expression of expression and that progressive voices are being put to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service took several former government officials and members of the teacher's association with the grounds that they expressed themselves on commentaries in social media critical to the problems linked to the deep in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the Hdaibs concert is just the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to work as structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him is an independent member and take. Jordan has now glorifies Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - it is of slow, need and inner changes. he is sure that these changes take place in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs also, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream about bringing his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to "experiencing them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is characterized by music, art and literature of a real and fundamental openness - and not caused by bombs, streetunitions and artificial manner. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time is done, Hdaib will continue, and therefore also resist resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which aman belongs to a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These large, extravagant wardolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta Festivals.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is believed that there is a variant of the Tanabata festivals that is usually celebrated in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the drums, the drums and dancing over more than one thousand years, came into the Northeast, to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, into the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We could grab a couple of great seats, so we got a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can imagine just how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A joint centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition to Wa no Akari (literal).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been watching the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fixed cars are just visible.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only True - and to spend his summer in the summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was here and watched the # Nebutafestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The view of a 18-meter high gate was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let us enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely were outer appearance and body care so important as in this story, because they help maintain the Peruvian youth from crime and promote a legitimate profession like the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus most important harbor, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic centre of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where street smokes and illegal drug trade are daily.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - increasing demand for men's aesthetic services.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance, and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has managed to give more normalization into the experienced hands of hairdressers that can recreate these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairstyle "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There are experts from each other to show who can create the centrist Looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitors can be seen on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as school Augusto Salazar Bondy, who found himself in El Callao, find here an opportunity to exchange young people against barber tools and instead of bad advice an apprenticeship in hairdresser's art that enables them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and providing opportunities, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops in early March and reported about some of their achievements:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only specialist school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud, because of love to the children we have built this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: lovingress of guerrillas</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>

<seg id="2181">The following article is the revised version of the contribution "love messages on guerrillas," which has published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here in a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not much more important to accommodate people who have been expelled, affection for affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question was exactly the question of the two young Colombian activists Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the Young Youth Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired her to write the campaign of cartas por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation), the young people encouraged to write guerrists letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">First, recently, her country scene was a historical event, and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had closed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered to be the signing of the peace agreement as so significant that the Colombian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">In front of Colombia, however, a long way until you can speak of a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillabbers who lived in illegal camps for many years, had been exposed to a rhetoric of war and contributed around the clock their weapons, and then they have to integrate into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, in turn, are accustomed to life in permanent fear and in some cases of deep hatred toward guerrillas, these must now take in their ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that young Colombia had to join together and would have to help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's what they did, too: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love messages from former guerrillas to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for every former guerrillas - which will then be handed over to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea of the study was created on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureate who took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This stated that we love the people who love, on Valentine's Day of thousands of love letters, but those who need to need much more necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plan, he continued to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent need.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus, the plan, letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, which now will find their place in society and will show themselves a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story about a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Until now, more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that someone would be forgiven me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to the Caldono Cauca region on 19 March at one of the UN camps in the region of Caldono Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation to bring the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC put themselves on how they had done it earlier to meet the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of complaining of people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it is incredible how many different feelings can walk through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is in-between," explains the Political Social-Student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor's Board of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">Having handed over the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrillas live) I saw a guerrillas who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go on, because next to him on the bed a MGL pomegranate, a lethal weapon in the thorn.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "and she said," "" "Hello, what do they do?" "" "he answered," "" "I answer a letter I wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life, someone has written something like this, that's why I answer it. "suddenly the tears suddenly ran on the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him completely, and put me beside the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war, was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion to this fighting, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never expected something different from life than war. the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before the starvation. "I never thought someone would forgive me for my fault.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a company outside there, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have learned, how I have to handle weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace rules, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the start, students and some of the FARC attended a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all raised as already war and the FARC already existed in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore the leaders of the FARC said the history of the organization, its ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we experienced how the social injustice from the State of the entire Colombian people seemed to develop, we can contribute to a political party, we can contribute to the society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For a purpose of these magnitude it's worth to overcome all obstacles, "one of them said.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Those people have never heard yet, who have never heard yet hearing, and recognise that people who have often seen as monsters and even hate them, even only people with beautiful feelings, which were turned through their lives and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality, in which the country lives, hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comfort me that all men - even those who have done and have done so much harm to us, and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have answered the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono Cauca, wrote the example of DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the Archbishop of the City of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">Colombia was made known, that after disarmament peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to take up the weapons and to protest for their rights. and that is also fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We are now facing peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">Therefore, we call all the defenders of peace - no matter which breed, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, afford our contribution, and bring sacrifices, because we know from your own experience that nothing is simple. for those who defend life as the basis of existence, many difficulties will come.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2243">Homosexual and queer people living in the Caucasus region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination, physical and sexual violence and blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="2244">Terror have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat, which depends like a Damokless on the local LGBTQ community, is not just over night.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grozny, who shared some of their experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">LGBTQ-legal situation in Chechnya has captured the international headlines in several months after reports, torture and killing of queerer men in the Republic of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaja Gaseta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities, who took suspiciously queere men and raised them into secret prisons in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a Transwoman, was born in Grozny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Even since her childhood, she felt that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When they grow up, you became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, so she went to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chechnya experienced by gender equality, the hunt was opened to Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">She was afraid of her life to the United States last year.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer helper in a human rights organization.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a transwoman who was stowed in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took it without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone of whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread everywhere on the Internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his Chechen Friends, with the following message: "then there is no more men in Chechnya that can eliminate these disgrace?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos of my documents created the whole WhatsApp round.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On October 10th, 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was just doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car I heard a man's voice: "here's a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I did hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard a proposition, but this time at Chechen: "how long will you still escape the family?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost the consciousness and awoke up last end of the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had everything together and started screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two words in my right lung wings.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which gems you were put - in which the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor stood up and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his office, I got to do it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I appreciate him that he has been respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">I got threats from the last February.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote to me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightfall.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya to prove that everything was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They made absurd demands: some told me that I had to prove it by up without the roads; others wanted me to open up in the official television in Grozny and say that I didn't change my gender, that everything was only bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how has your family tries to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people answered once my mum on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world, not only your family, but the whole republic were disappointed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">We can't touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to vanish from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she placed a rope around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily, the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time, I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later under the window, I got a car with a darkened window plates and a number plate.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it had happened for the third time, I realized that there was something lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights-friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: what are you fled?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons, I don't want to give up their names, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without sign up, without identification, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a foreigner.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe, you're in safety, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are steckst. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it: it's the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we do not talk about gender equality, this is a taboo theme.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally Caucasian elements are still in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, this secelian barrier can't overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I really admit to look like the person looking out of their past - thus, in my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What are your friends, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the needed I needed current information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked with somebody who received a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during the Ramadan were not arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he didn't stop a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and relatives now.</seg>
<seg id="2328">That is what I mean, they probably invite their relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood genres.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there still gay men kept in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: an acquaintance of me, there was just not many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, especially those who have not wealthy relatives or that were dropped from their relatives to establish the Kadyrows Court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be imprisoned there, so you can present them as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: if they are killed, they will show their bodies in television and claim they had attacked any village or military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">You understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but targeted specifically to radicalise itself.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now just a delay or do you have a source of that information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was incarcerated in Argun for a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard grew.</seg>
<seg id="2339">Since then there was nothing new from them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was self-taken when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now they were not presented as a bandits, but there were no reports until now. we suggest that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would there not be allowed to shave this man to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings are people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation, already in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I believe that I was already familiar with Grozny before 2003 when I was living there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">Seriously!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sharia was considered, I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">Russia would originally wanted to lead us to the "Civilization," but finally threw us into the stoneage.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: what is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were slipped; I had colored lashes, wore tubes and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia has never made me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian Theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew of it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a voice of phrases: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Say not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">People often say it often to children if they are fun over the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just keep their eyes closed before you, because they thought they are ill?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never have insulted me, never hunted, never struck.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this claim time have?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long, to Kadyrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality on morals.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He didn't talk about us, but rather about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - one could feel how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Everyone who had scourged and laughed before, looked at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the meantime, I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you now go after?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I have always worked as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communed with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We perfectly organize teacreels, gatherings, I compassed them to the hospital and help them get eating cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't spend a penny.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people themselves, when I disklapperate.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidalab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: it is alvalry.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to make you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no swings with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestan have those who have the Cabardiner who have the Russians too, on the entire planet it is - but not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is unpleasant to hear something.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicable Muslims walking into the mosque and during the Ramadan fasten - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think of transit identity of men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experience. but that's a chest.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different kinds of emotion to be exact, different lifesettings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I will be here personally, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn an increase of self-moring within the poverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian ancestor region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last months there has been a strong rise from self-morants.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27, the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is characterised by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the South West of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered under anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, which can ascend the inability to his family, so Ahwazi-Human Rights, who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube was the moments when he had lit himself, firmly.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people make it quick to clear the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Talegrown hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the internal technologies were so strong that doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that happened in August in the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists in the place warned that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have a thing in common: there were all family fathers, who felt like persecution on the Iranian government, helpless and incapable of feeding their families and to pursue a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, in which a majority of Arab citizens living in Iran, was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult to stimulate the native Arab population to dispute their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, Arabian Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and undertook great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz Region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most valuable and valuable working areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite this valuable resource, regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the native population gets only little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It often is victims of untreated diseases, hunger and effusions.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime rejected the Ahmadazi regime systematically workplaces in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also has a wide variety of tribes which are surrounded by the Arab areas in the Persian areas where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are surrounded.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to destroy the devastation in the region by dryness causing destruction to waste, and local agriculture, as well as fishing and palm trees.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate under the Arab Ahawzi-juveniles rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Irish general director of cooperation, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis, who completed a work, completed 55% a secondary school and completed 45% a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance "</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian ancestral human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" of the number of self-morazi among young men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that especially the unemployment has become much worse. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic ethnic persers and anti-Arab discrimination in the setting process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since functional and institutions do not prefer Arabic labour, the local Arab Ahwazi is moved from access to working possibilities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to annihilate the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to constrain their livelihoods outside their home of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their fore- and surnames to hide their belonging to the genealogy, because even Arab names will not be tolerated, because the speaking of Arabic language or the Arab language.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In view of the circumstances that the Arab of Ahwazi must endure, human rights activists beat alert before the situation gets explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to wait if the world is waking up and taking knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is an revised version of the opinion published by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the AfrofÃ©minas website. the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">They can be read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I'm not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who advocate himself as intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They are wondering why I'm not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even thought well-thought scientific and social arguments before me why I should be feminist and why we should generally have all feminists *.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, that women still earn less money in spite of the same education as men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation, if it is about what they are allowed to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women sooner or later meet in various areas of life to a glass ceiling, and that discrimination based on gender is still passing through the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer double and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: when I come to talk on skin color, racism, black Cis women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or in black women from the Diaspora; when I mention that we were always under racism and discrimination; when I mention, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists were silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But they all agree that women - all women should come together to empt "their voices, and 'Kumbaya, my lord' to sing 'to reach the equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about that, in addition to sexualised violence, there is a institutional form of racial or motivated violence that we have exposed black women to two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or about that black women and women of other ethnicities and country of origin will earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Black girls and girls with migrant backgrounds are often referred to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with migrant backgrounds are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership, as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On one hand, I want all women, all men and all men have neither skin color the same rights; on the other hand, I cannot agree as a black woman, in whose center the white woman stands to take into account the unrighteousnesses in their thinking, which relate to both gender as well as on the skin color of one person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I'm exhausted and won't fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere, which always and countless other black women always rejected me.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "" "" "I said in 1851 in their speech:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuses to maintain a ideology in which the black woman is a human and marginalised nature." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join me groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs, to promote their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to increase white women the importance of overlap of skin color and gender. for some of them will continue to say the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to load them a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give birth to women in different homes and to abstain from white feminism, there is still the word "Feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">"" "" "" "I am going to release myself full of feminism and to put me out of the Womanism, which for my dark skin and my status as woman was called into life instead of a white feminist paradigm, which is so stubborn that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon." ""</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before we define black women in our own ideas and give us the sphere, which will be created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora's Hudson-Weems, author of the book of africana womanism: we can defend ourselves that we can defend ourselves in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, mental, mental, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists instantly become separations and marginalization, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic area, I can empt black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognised because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a part of this paradigm.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and worked version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" by turally. the article is part of the series # PorSerMujer (# softer smoking) who reported on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect people affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner said Ada BÃ¡ez, that she has nothing against Luis Balbuena, their expartner who had become violent against violent.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship, some time have passed and the police said, her statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another wife Balbuena showed no abuse of abuse, Ada BÃ¡ez did not profit.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman moved her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">To break the vicious circle of violence against women, is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women make an indication at all, they do not get support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit, victims of violence to be registered at all in law enforcement authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Inside 1 blows and Statistical 2 Invisible abuses and a legal system that doesn't underestimate 3 bays laws: good approach, poor application strokes and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It's hard to see how many women are really harassed, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are various data and reports that do not even ansate the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the Office of the Office of Attorney General 9600 advertisements for domestic violence. 70% of them went to violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of advertisements during the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 ads for domestic violence in the peace of peace. there were also 86% of the advertisements from women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads 40% of women said they were physically harassed, 55% of women spoke of psychic abuses.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayan female minister Ana Baiardi only few of these offenders are actually indicated also. "on any woman who will not be reimbursed in Paraguay because of psychic abuse, 9 women will do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "on any woman who are refunded for physical abuse, two women who do not do this," "" "stated at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's murder in Paraguay was not lawful for criminal prosecution, the prosecution agencies cannot document appropriately how many women will be murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Journalists killed at least 12 cases of women in the country alone until August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2506">At the beginning, she didn't want to do that, but then she would have to regret. this should be regretted for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and not with Carlos together. but for two years she endured the psychic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would have been victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read it earlier, I always thought that only women had happened to subjection to violent men, because they deceive of violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, they wrote articles on Facebook where they described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship, and told how he insulated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people answered their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he ever raised the hand against them and refused to confess that his behavior was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users also asked why they had fallen so long by Carlos and left him not earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like that, as they wanted to say that victims of abuse should have at least a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who was not from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner is harassed her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te CREO network ("I believe you"), which consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can talk with others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias Fall everything began with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias advertisements in the authorities remained without earnings and also from their relatives, they received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She led a trial against her former partner who developed into an inconsistent legal struggle between Paraguay and their homeland, where it was mainly about money, power and influence of their former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Bays laws: good approach, poor implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good, but not applied.</seg>
<seg id="2527">"" "the abuse of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," "" "says Victoria Santos." ""</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees major problems in the application of the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a draft bill was discussed under the hashtag # PorElla (# Principal).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the # NiUnaMenos movement (# non insert) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original bill of the law sees to explain the feminid in a self-standing criminal case and punish harder as it is already in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the legislature has changed in some points to also win the MPs for the law that were supposed to be denied the way for the decriminalization of abortions that are currently banned in Paraguay up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The initial bill had foreseen, the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) process cost, which have to carry out the victims of violence even if they just want to create and receive a secure accommodation, to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial resources available:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as part of human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here, a rethinking must take place, so force no longer be considered a bit of normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">In view of these facts, he is debating and contributes to that the perpetrators brought away the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to refund for so long, until mistreatment is no longer valid.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was adopted in the Paraguayan Senate. previously parts of the law had been modified. among other things, one passage has been canceled, who called for the partners in the cases of domestic violence on reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section regarding reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack its victims.</seg>
<seg id="2542">The submission of words "gender," "political force" and "sexual harassment" from parts of the law is considered a great setback.</seg>
<seg id="2543">This article is the shortened and worked version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" by turally. the article is part of the series # PorSerMujer (# softer smoking) who reported on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Most names have been changed to protect people affected.</seg>

<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the omanic authorities have closed an independent Arabic newspaper Azamn because of their coverage of corruption in the sultan.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, is still in prison where he served one year sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri were also arrested and ordered before the court, but later released.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been governed by Sultan Qabus ibn Said since 1970, who came to power after he had his father, Said ibn Taimur, was killed by a state of affairs.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, along with his role as the only sultan, the chief offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Finance, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The sultans of the Sultans is characterized by the harsh effort of security forces, in particular the domestic secret service, including freedom of freedom, to limit and defending human rights, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists, to intimidate and incarnate.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities fail peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights systematically and hinders citizens, also activists, to their views on the country's public affairs, such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, its closure and detention of three of their editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country.</seg>

<seg id="2564">The court sentenced the three journalists to prison, and ordered the final closure of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj, both among others, were convicted of disturbance of the public order, "abuse of the Internet" and "undermining of the state."</seg>
<seg id="2566">Al-Haj was also found guilty of violations of an audience and defamation.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj was sentenced to three-year prison sentences and fines in the amount of 3000 omanic Rial (7800 US dollars).</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after the use of "an information network to spread the material that could pose a danger to public order."</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, figure out with his permission</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media only rarely or not mentioned. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need on locally medical research, there are two reasons: there are many medicines and vaccines required to cover the special medical requirements on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have widely regarded as elsewhere in the poorest countries in Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investments for the exploration of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research, which is carried out by African scientists themselves, helps to establish their research capacity in Africa. a major role in science and technology can only be implemented for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr Ranjit Warrier is director of the Centre for the exploration of infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, especially when the AIDS epidemic showed first grazing effects on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, at first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania he explored himself on the HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the samic health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misconceptions about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research subject?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work on the use of research results. I support the sambische national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just starred a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB, and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Gv: what are your opinion of important scientific topics in your country and generally in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we use only solutions that have been developed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always remain recipients, instead of being movers.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not suitable in our surroundings, and sometimes it is impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Gv: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is to find appropriate scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">Projects are funded differently well.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who come back or prefer, because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Gv: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work, which you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries. it costs much money, continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Lab material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">Gv: what is the opinion of science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Gv: how great is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There are need of special scientific training, starting in any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer sciences, big data, exploration of world traumas, health care (non-transferable and infectious diseases), and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa across Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it's the limited speed, things to do, and make no access to scientific expertise, which represent challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">"" "the system that magazines are only accessible to payment (the so-called" "" "Paywall" "" "), also limited to the amount of available information and the speed of research." ""</seg>
<seg id="2627">From USA to India: like "open source" seed producers to change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine called on solutions for environmental issues worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton had a salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company provides 114 sorts, such as the shredding, the first plant, which has been cultivated and consumed by NASA's astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work became only due to its own casusions and the question of how many of the types of salads can get limits.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000, he noticed that more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only available for individual types, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special rotor or green leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past years, more such patents have been registered for ever more plants such as cereals or cartons. based on this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food safety in the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia of old tradition, Morton is still a salad, but now he needs longer, since his work is becoming increasingly difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it's like being a rock broker in a river, in order to pumping the pumping.</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do this now, but it's a breach with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think these patents are going to go far away to salads.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they withstand before court, no one can breed a new salad of salads, because all the features are already patented. "he makes it as good as possible, and tries to tell those attributes that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and endeavoured to use no material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">It has also connected itself to a motion that is always bigger in the US and anywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("open source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">The astronauts of the International Space Station ISS drew red RÃ¶mersalat of the sort Outspeaker in the "greenhouse" station, and eaten there. it is being tested if plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like this, the movement from the IT-area would come and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "open-source" seed) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software to provide alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched into life in order to ensure that some plant species and clubs are not protected as intellectual property and can be used permanently used for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the framework of the initiative, called Ossi, U.S. breeder can also undertake that others can use the seeds free of them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean, however, that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open source" breeder only allow others to breed their seed to breed such as own varieties, and it is not immediately added - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patties.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeder and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emonial professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board, Jack Kloppenburg are control of seed and the possibility of breeding new plants, both important for nutrition security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seed plays a role in major interrelations such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeder would try to chill the latter, or chill with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open-source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic agriculture or Syngenta, and Monsanto and Bayer, who would like to buy food and sustainable vegetables, which is also offered on farms in August and September 2016, should also know that the way in which this vegetable is farmed.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutritional imperfections without a seed guarantee is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the open source Seed initiative are committed to others their seed should remain available freely. in contrast, their approach in contrast to the seed and plant features are to be patented.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights to plant materials, which is thus increasingly restricted, unceasable.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, director of the Ossi, employed in her PhD thesis with genetically variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all cartotations are protected as intellectual property, making it even usable for plant breeders either.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there are no estimates yet, but experts such as Luby suggests that massacred plants are patented in even larger style than lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visibility</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so cultivated that they would have targeted characteristics - such as their taste or color improves until such as they prosper in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Adversaries of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeder is increasing by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is currently necessary than ever before, as the changes in climate change are much worse predictable.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto's Carly Scaduto recognize that genetic diversity was generally important and also crucial for monsantos activities. with a total of four genbanks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture in the United States, the company set itself the company for conservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it does not contradict that intellectual property transfer other breeders, as "patents and the protection of plant variant innovations." a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow when the patent has expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method at the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not prevent innovations, but promotes the public more material and know-how available by the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton, it looks different: wait 20 years until a patent expires, certainly no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is, however, that genetic resources have always been a general public and it should remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">That is what drives us, and it is impossible to us if we are unable to still use the best and latest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton interferon to the concept of constructing plant characteristics: "we do not really create the features.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them out and as breeder, we finally have no idea how plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the U.S. state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is still another important aspect of the plant breeding: "if you breed a variety, its own values are breeding in them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation of massaging herbicides are needed, breeeing into its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto) patents have, they create most smaller seed companies, also to survive without patents - they either reject it or do it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeder would be innovative by preventing plant patrons: "it looks like I was able to produce new things with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that are patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need new material for my catalog, as I know that my competitors are going to sell my varieties in a few years themselves, "he says." with a patent it is protected for 20 years before competition, with which it simply makes it quite simple. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the USA seem to be leading in the "Open Source" breeding, however, the concept spreads rapidly throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources, works a "open source" seed program. the centre with farmers collaborates and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "open source" seed and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"" "the German organization Agrecol is working on an" "" "open source" "" "license which ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of Ossi obligation for breeder in the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding differ from country to land, essential for Ossi obligation, not simply to be one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">In early November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, explains that conventional farmed plants should not be patented. thus, it talks about the current practice of the European Patent Office, which allows patents on conventionally farmed plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is to put forward to the governments of the Member States to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed banks and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn something about the "open source" seed movement and global trend towards paterning seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos "program for" Open Source "seed systems," that the organisation is currently building a worldwide alliance for "open source" seed systems, for the scheduled start of the official starting date.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger from environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development organization USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database into seeds and biodiversity, to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a consortium of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - a report indicate that farmers have to be able to exchange and improve the seed industry, so that a stable supply of food can be ensured.</seg>
<seg id="2694">In the report, the importance of a diverse, local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems emphasizes - a context, by the Luby of Ossi hopes it will soon be more people.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"" "" "" "the movement for regional and ecological food mainly has been sacrificed, where and as something is grown, and seeds are barely played a role," "" "so Luby." "" "we are now attempting to clear the people that there is more behind their food." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human Rights Organization and Blog are the newest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">"" "" "" "the Egyptian authorities still unlock content on the Internet." ""</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnists.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of the 05.August, the Egyptian government locked up the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt, as well as the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">On August, the network published a statement on Facebook where it criticised the Egyptian authorities for this step sharp and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Reserved in bt- despite this attack and participation in the Arab world and to defend a voice in this part of the world, so it was never so important as now. ANHRI confirmed that all the technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the lock and do not imitate. we wait to keep our task further.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is regarded as the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked more than two months of 21 websites, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic language of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network of Al Jazeera for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of web site barriers to victims. @ anhri is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI there is no access to the blog of the columnists and Human Rights Investigator Ahmed Gamal Ziada.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the spreading of columnists and articles that he doesn't write available websites and media in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now, the blog, which he raised to bypass the Egyptian government's ensorship, even the aim of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider with whom Ziadas blog is home, however, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after he was arrested by Egyptian security officers in December 2013, while he reported about the student protests and gave a video how the police arrested physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles rotate mainly to politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook commentary, Ziada said to the lock through the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blog is very old, however, in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the blocking of the blog is not meaningful to the world, so it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been able to give me the feeling of a siege resistance; an arrest, a attempted murder, unloading at the National Security Council, the lock of Blogs and any other web site for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I was not in vain. in other words, my words have an influence, even if only a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to the post of articles to bypass the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">However, after they blocked it, and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The Mutigen go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06. August 133 websites. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various internet service providers (ISP), among others Orange, Vodafone and Etiquat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the blocking of providers by converting internet censorship and private surfing possible, so-called Virtual Private Network (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12 we saw how the blocking of Web sites that VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates the intention of government to blocking content and filtering content, to which Egyptian users might have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In addition, the situation is made in addition to closed doors, ensuring that the Egyptian population has no right, with which it can proceed in judgment against those actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">Fighting the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian army at a deployment in the favela of NiterÃ³i, a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Date for day report newspapers in Brazil with dark news from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard drawings.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old was shot in school," Every second day a police officer took place in Rio de Janeiro, "" Serve screwed pharmacy with military weapons, "" President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Marine and Air Force to Rio. "</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in an attractive financial situation, the force threshold of 2017 in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation, Global Justice, called the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday, and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">Thus, for the detailed reporting on violence in the Rio agreed newspaper "Extra" on August 16 the Editorial "That is not normal," in which it announced, a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision declared the newspaper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes committed in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sexual interruptures, etc. everything that happened from the civilized standard and what only happens in Rio will be published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, so that we didn't close our eyes from cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes declared that this decision was not a reason for pride but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper on the world with a war rubrik in a country that does not recognise the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist discussed that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 843 areas, a journalist declared that the criminal organizations will be controlled.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the Editorial, the newspaper wrote:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war of war, when it is distorted, can also be used, grind the police, who first shoot and then ask questions to tuck.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Mafia and their partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Would the designation "war" be profitable more than it?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira is arguing that violence as a "war." this was in their opinion about a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to commit responsibilities at the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is no war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and worse planning - such as extra in the analysis of the military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in staff, education and an historical and self-counterfeit neglect of the public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">To memory: the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just his capital.</seg>

<seg id="2779">"" "when we look at the murder rate per state, Rio is at number 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">Specially, the company Globo, the largest media company of South America, emphasises such as CecÃ­lia, has repeatedly been repeating the state policy of the state.</seg>
<seg id="2781">In addition to these security policies, the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), one of the State of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to conquer a Favela by using a massive police station and deployed a unit permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2782">At the beginning, this resulted in a decrease of nonviolent deaths. for some years, the UPP has led to several reports about shianas and reprisals against the poor municipalities which was supposed to protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux pointed out of one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio will also have serious consequences for people after themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this, it demands the state to use, means and ways that are typical for a war. this is the intrusion into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and the object for "collaterals damage" and "distorted balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War, or her, fact is that the inhabitants of the Favelas in Rio will continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week it is now that the police invents the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho to slash the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this force, this incident was made headlines: a fruit creseller died due to shots, who fired the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the following civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories, a joint initiative of the Peace organisation PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, located in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Yzzor and Idlib currently around one million Syrians in a state of the siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The region of East Ghouta is particularly strong affected, where an attack with chemical weapons requested the lives of hundreds of civilians on 21 August 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition, are based on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these of the rebels have controlled territories outside Damascus under siege, leading to the inhabitants caused by tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">By the years of blockade, traditional food products such as flesh has become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As an argument, a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and academics teaches the inhabitants of Eastern Ghouta, as they can plant their own fungi as a "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call itself Ghiras Aldrawda and lead the project together with NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Fungi do not belong to the traditional, in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their nutritional value makes them an attractive food for many residents of the besieged Eastern Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">Director of the project, subscription Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to flesh, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested in the districts of Portugal in many districts of Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ramped in the north of Portugal in the week.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Two-and forty persons died, and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October. this resulted in fact that the government proclaimed a week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths.</seg>

<seg id="2873">During a night in autumn 1994, the conquest of Afghanistan began the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years ago, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groupings, which had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. Afghanistan had become a country of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">Exactly at that time Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy, belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, in the province of Ghazni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner together.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even if his mother didn't say so at that time, she knew she would not see her son much more - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">The boy was to break up in the morning.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezara-e-Wahdat party had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara felt unprotected.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban is getting closer to their hatred for the Hazara.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a cohlet. the work was heavy and he made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wages, and went into Iran. once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and towed sacks with mortars who were heavier than he himself to make himself living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, where we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no services and no heating. we hung nylon in front of open windows, so that we don't erfringe at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf made his life without documents in Iran and made ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities refused his asylum request, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Asharaf was homeless, running alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church which divided up twice a day meal in needy.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy because of relatively high awareness rates is a kind of second chance for asylum seekers. it is true, however, that the conditions that asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">The vast majority of the asylum seekers will be accommodated in the more than 3000 "special recording centres." there are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared staff. "</seg>
