that is James R@@ isen .
you might know him , because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times reporter .
a long before somebody heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly known that the NSA is illegal teleph@@ ones from Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic U.S. intelligence operation , in which the CIA had literally uns@@ killed dra@@ fts for a atomic bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who doesn &apos;t really liked the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for nearly 10 years , the government against R@@ isen was determined and asked him to call his alleged sources .
in this train , it became a symbol for the pattern of the government , to condemn W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and discussed journalists .
according to the first constitutional law , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right when media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the pattern they do .
so when the government near R@@ isen was ank@@ ying , he did something that many cour@@ ageous rep@@ orters did before him : he refused and told that he would prefer to go into prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go into prison .
but then , only days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , though they are for years , it would be imper@@ ative for their case , the demands of the government were dropped .
the reason : in the period of electronic monitoring , rep@@ orters and sources can hide .
instead of bringing R@@ isen to the statements , they could also do his digital Foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his understanding , wor@@ sen@@ ed his phone calls ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , its loan information , and even travel tips with the list of his flights .
in the midst of these information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and risk of risk .
unfortunately , that is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has convicted more than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government becomes too much of their work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of being a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower left to a journalist .
so we put the press work on the game which is to be protected by the first constitutional law , because the government has more opportunities to sp@@ ying everyone .
but the government &apos;s government allowed to b@@ ypass rep@@ orters rights , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better .
and indeed , they can contact them from the moment in which they may contact , rather than afterwards , in the witness .
today , there are communication software that had not yet been written when R@@ isen has written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
one such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source trans@@ mitt@@ ent system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the internet famous , which was developed by us , Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now been developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I have been working .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , head to a news website , like the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send documents , as in any ordinary contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the local news agency has access .
so the government cannot provide more information about secretly , and many of the information they would like would not be available from the outs@@ et .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is , however , only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments are developing new es@@ pion@@ age technologies all over the world .
it is possible to ensure that not only technology professionals like Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to give abuse . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers .
who wants to report about abuse during the supply of soldiers humble and of crowded hospitals . or the next environmental workers , the alarm to the contam@@ inated water of Flin@@ t . or a wall street insi@@ der who warns us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to exp@@ ose the crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the largest data sheet of history was published . &#93; &#91; the Panama Pap@@ ers &apos; revealed that Rei@@ chs and M@@ igh@@ ty &#93; have been hiding in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to have an explanation . &#93; this week we were asked by news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents in Panama &apos;s based law firm Mos@@ que Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of this documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression how customers , banks and lawyers to companies such as Mos@@ que Fon@@ sec@@ a go and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up that ? &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has re@@ signed .
also , there are reports that a bund@@ led by the brutal Syrian dictator , Bashar al @-@ Assad &apos;s letters companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it claims that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin is leading to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others who wait nervous on the next release , and to the next revealed documents .
now that sounds like the plot of a agent or John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems we@@ eps from you , me , ordinary people .
why should this happen ?
but the truth is , if the rich and mighty are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few , their assets to hide and conce@@ aled -- something that we have been discussing and reveal for ten years .
I think many people are very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function .
I always make it like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ z@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so , one company has a company in another company , in another company that makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these prayer .
it may be very difficult for prosec@@ uting and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really understand what thing is .
I think it &apos;s interesting that there is less reports about this matter in the US .
probably , because there were no prominent American citizens , who came in these revel@@ ations in this sc@@ andal .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans that hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but by the principle , after which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function , Mos@@ que Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we would have a database of c@@ ay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States .
in fact , it is so that in some US states it needs fewer information , to provide less information to create a company than to get a library .
this type of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed it to gr@@ asp students from school districts , school children .
it has allowed frau@@ ght , especially vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does this work ?
so we sent a conce@@ aled investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 Law@@ yers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ators gave himself as an African minister , who wanted to bring the susp@@ icious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht and a private jet .
we really shocked that everyone would make suggestions for a lawyer at our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
these were all pre@@ ferences . none of these lawyers accepted us as a client , and of course nobody was handed over to anyone . yet it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as single emer@@ gen@@ cies .
it is not about a single lawyer who has under@@ spread out our conce@@ aled investig@@ ator .
it is not a single leader , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to overcome this , we need to change the rules .
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior harder .
this may sound very comfor@@ ting , as if we could not do anything against it ; as if nothing could have changed , as if there is always the rich and mighty .
but as the borrow@@ ed optim@@ ist I see that a lot has begun to change .
over the last few years , we have seen cl@@ ashes on more transparency , regarding the owners of companies .
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has been recorded at the national level at national level , who is really behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts that the U.S. does not come back here .
representatives of both parties have taken a bill in both par@@ liament@@ arians , but this does not matter the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure in the US and globally for more transparency .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for changes .
we need common people who are mad if they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ lights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need executives in the business that stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and use it through laws this type of in@@ transparency .
together , we can finally end the In@@ transparent , which now enables this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ undering .
this is the story , just as I was ab@@ duc@@ ted , and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ ho@@ e .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my matters .
he bought one of my works .
he was alone in the city , and just made a road trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just met him only ! he says he would go to peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I will not kidn@@ apping into the boot of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air bubble . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; u@@ h , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the night , I was in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what have I broken with me ?
a wild foreign sleeps in my living room .
what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot;
I got such fear , that I went out of bed , at toe @-@ pointed at the door , and my bedroom door shut down .
but he wasn &apos;t crazy .
we are still in touch .
the artwork that he had bought from me is now in its class@@ room . he is now teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my perspective .
maybe the people , who were sold to me in childhood , were friends who were waiting for waiting to be discovered ?
people on my air matt@@ resses was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air matt@@ resses .
let &apos;s make a time leap , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost complete , my room@@ mate draws off and the rent is increased .
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can make it that fear turn into fun .
I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mates Brian Ches@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I got something that could earn something . our apartment will stay with a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air matt@@ resses and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast &quot; &#91; Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests allowed us to sleep for 20 dollars on the air matt@@ resses on a wood floor .
they found it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure to make our cheese ham @-@ O@@ mel@@ s completely different because we made it for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them all over the city . when we adopted our last guest and the door to the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and paid our rent ?
things came into rolls .
my former fellow worker , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept .
so we presented ourselves to investors : &quot; we want to create a site , in which people are public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of rooms whose doors you closes when visiting .
over the Internet , they can then invite wild@@ foreign people to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the rocket would ign@@ ite .
but they do not act .
no one , who is still very comfort , would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people .
why ?
because , as children , we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
when you have a problem , you can see things that can be good . we could design .
at the Academy of Art we learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the whole livel@@ ihood .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust among people who had never met before .
can design work such a bit ?
is it possible to create trust in design ?
I want to give you a taste , which is the degree of confidence .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
now I want you to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left seat .
this silent flight of panic , you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts you feel when they open the door the door .
for the only thing that personal as your mobile phone is , your home is home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , you can see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a fore@@ ig@@ ner in the hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
so also the most guests feel when they are looking somewhere else .
only for this reason , our company can exist .
just like that , who has actually made Al Go@@ res mobile phone ?
could you please tell Twitter that he is can@@ di@@ ted for the President of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones now .
they have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first introduced with his name , when he tells , where he comes from , how his dog or his children were called ?
imagine you would have 150 Be@@ ach@@ s that say : &quot; it can really keep up the mobile phones very well ! &quot;
how would you feel then , if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ kept feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning we have made some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to give negative evidence .
ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest were submitted to their ass@@ essments , before we ordered them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is to trust one another , depending on how they are similar to age and place .
little surprising we trust the people most who are the most similar .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social pre@@ ference .
it is exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by ass@@ essments .
if one has less than three divisions , nothing changes .
but one has more than ten , changes everything .
a good reputation sti@@ pul@@ ate simil@@ arities .
so the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep root pre@@ ferences .
in addition , we discovered that trust is dependent on how much you are budget .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
when you tell too little about how &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you do not get an answer .
one tells you too much , for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is also not accepted .
so there is an optimal degree of op@@ enness , such as &quot; Great Art@@ work in your apartment ! I &apos;ll do with my family holiday . &quot;
how can we create it with design , make this degree of op@@ enness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help , overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against strangers .
with which we did not reck@@ oned , the great multitude of people who were more than ready to submit these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you see how many people will take our offer .
one can recognize three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need that had not been covered before .
for us , business is just very good .
of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who are un@@ allowed parties , or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have to be guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front line when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than those calls . it &apos;s hurt , if I just think of it .
the dis@@ appointment that you hear in the voice of call@@ ers , and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us .
fortunately , of the 123 million nights , only a fra@@ ction had a problem .
because people trusted in each other .
if confidence works , it can arise .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack there .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is its assessment :
&quot; perfect house for trav@@ ellers , which are incl@@ ined by sitting activities for heart attacks .
the area is beautiful and with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ and@@ ra are real def@@ ici@@ encies that save life , although they don &apos;t know a correct one .
you drive a hospital in your own car when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books by .
you can stay a even longer without calcul@@ ating the extra @-@ nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay starts .
but these relations behind the pure monetary transactions are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
when I stum@@ bled on this word for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the thought of the part with money transactions fit together ?
it &apos;s all about an economical trading .
but it is simply not just to call our rental industry , the thing will not be justified .
share Economy describes a trade , which promises human relationships .
people lay down a portion of themselves , and that changes everything .
when you travel nowadays , it is easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what would , however , if traveling was a generous buffet out of local impressions ?
what if at any place where you visited , a group would be waiting for you to complete a thoroughly and show you one at a bar pent@@ our quarter , of which one has never heard ;
or if you could learn from a five @-@ star cook ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to privacy .
what if we would make apartments of a reason to inter@@ actions ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities should have imag@@ ined the thoughts of joint ?
I imagine living cities , which allow us society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and sc@@ ot@@ ation .
South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul has already started this project . many parking spaces that belonged to the government ,
were offered foreigners . students who were looking for a lead ,
they were medi@@ ated to people whose children were moved out . they were incub@@ ators as incub@@ ators ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . our platform alone will be 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries with a foreign or self host .
the idea seems to be not so crazy , as it was taught to us .
we haven &apos;t invented the wheel .
hospitality also existed before .
there were similar sites before us .
so why did our work ?
apart from luck and timing , we realize that we can find the correct design with the shares of trust .
design can help us to overcome deep root pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I think it &apos;s amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it when a red Maz@@ da goes over to me .
we know of course , that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great impact , I wonder what we can use for the next time .
thank you .
what do you think , if you look at me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , a brain la@@ undering , a terrorist player ?
or simply a delay at security at the airport .
this is actually true .
I don &apos;t give you blame for your negative impressions .
so , the media represent men who look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the reporting of Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : Americans think that most would not know Muslims .
presumably the people are not talking to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met several Muslims : it &apos;s great to meet you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double espresso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ ven@@ ern @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , Baby , I was not born so .
I decided to have a decision .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ n me .
no , not as a homosex@@ ual man , like some of my friends , but as the Muslim . I decided to carry Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
my feminist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you cause yourself ? &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence , but with the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , me a perfect and un@@ att@@ ain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only passive the faith of my parents .
I have lost with the Koran .
I read it , thought , posed in question , doub@@ ted and believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow dev@@ otion that deep@@ ens themselves with any reading of the Kor@@ ans .
the beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
have you ever had the feeling that somebody is perc@@ ei@@ ving you , you complete , and somehow loves ?
it feels like that .
later I married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as engineer .
later , after my marriage , a child , I was living in the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of them probably remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had ti@@ pped at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; Eil@@ een . &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew into buildings , people sp@@ ouses in buildings .
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned rapidly into indig@@ nation .
why should I do such a thing ?
I changed the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &#91; ... &#93;
Oh , my God .
it is not only my country attacked , but in the N@@ u transformed me the deeds of others from a civil war into a susp@@ ects .
the same day we had to drive through the USA and the USA , to move into a new city and begin with the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I &apos;m silent -- as we were silent -- so deeply it went into my seat , and I was afraid to be recognized as the Muslim .
we moved to our apartment in this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then I heard , I read and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organisations that possessed : &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; Sei@@ d cau@@ ti@@ ously , &quot; &quot; ble@@ aching in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t temp@@ t you . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it became Friday in that week -- the day that Muslims gather to prayer .
and again the war@@ nings : &quot; not on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably understand@@ able , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people , who held free for Muslims to break free .
there was really bran@@ ding on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something does not feel right .
because people who attacked this country , have attacked our country .
I have destroyed the rage of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain themselves .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today , we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in that country -- it is Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to join Muslims and join mos@@ ques .
they talk about my church as a tumor in the body of the USA .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a malign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour one holds only under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less , because the question is wrong .
Muslims are like all the other Americans , not a tumour in the body of the United States , but a vital organ .
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors , instructor , instructor and Olympic risks .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
it may be a few parking fre@@ ed@@ old , but not stop terror .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to regard people with other faith , and show major participation .
and as I told me a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed prior to a computer .
in the radic@@ alization process , it has found that it begins online . as a first , the person is able to make a bra@@ ins from their community , so that the person believes that the person believes that the terrorists do not believe the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behaviour and ide@@ ology is a tra@@ itor or faith .
when we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we need to keep people going to the mosque .
some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as Muslim , as a mother , as a person , I believe that we have to do all to stop a group like the IS .
but we would like to add to their work world when you acknowle@@ dges it as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the C@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology to their &quot; holy book . &quot;
but when one throws a look at them , she does not drive what they l@@ ases in her &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality , which she can read these things into Scripture .
a remarkable im@@ am told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because they regard the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she was in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . every cl@@ ergy , with whom she spoke , brought her to silence , and told her that her wrath , her mind for the in@@ justice in the world , she would only bring them into trouble .
nothing inspi@@ res , and something that had made sense of its anger , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization through extre@@ mi@@ sts that they spoke a solution .
this Im@@ am turned the connection to God and their church again .
instead of acc@@ use them for their anger , he showed a construc@@ tive way for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , she kept to join the IS .
that was an insight as the Islam@@ opho@@ bia me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect each other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day affect our democracy , freedom of thought ?
a study -- actually several neu@@ rosci@@ enti@@ st studies -- show : if we fear ourselves , at least three things pass .
we accept a author@@ itarian government system , con@@ form@@ ity and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
a study shows : when using Test@@ aments news , it has been reported to have negative military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look at the time the mood is against Muslims upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never happened in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run of Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to raise the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning signs .
we may feel the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
in the assignment of collective guilt , it is not only about to explain themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .

she visited him there and he showed her life @-@ run . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when did such a young man become a jeal@@ ous young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few weeks after visiting Suz@@ anne at her brother and wife , she murdered her neighbor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as with an execution after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times in De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ smus can not only be imm@@ oral , but also le@@ thal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened to the 9 / 11 ?
have we walked to the mosque or stayed safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was no easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one , in which we can exercise our religion .
we decided to take the mosque .
we drove in silence with our son in the child &apos;s seat , with high pressure on the mosque .
I took him out , moved my shoes , went into the building hall , and what I saw was holding me .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Im@@ am made a announcement , than@@ ked and welcomed our guests , for half of the people were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , ath@@ ei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who have come to attack us , but to assist us .
in this moment , I have collapsed .
these people were there , because they had courage , courage , and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ smus ?
will you go on number safe ?
or will you connect to those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you nice !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have met a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say that you may say that you are a T@@ ED@@ Talk to work with deep @-@ depth thinking , an exception , and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , do not dec@@ eive itself . I am completely normal .
I &apos;m not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I &apos;m so usually how it is allowed .
if you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did it with the largest ever @-@ led study to Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I was an exception in any regard .
if people appear as a rule , then often the rule is broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you very much . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists , is about to become a Billi@@ ons shop shortly before .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ yers . it is made possible in research institutions around the world .
before air pack@@ ets entered into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the Fra@@ c Centre in France built live a six @-@ meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . a few years ago , they began to fly with rop@@ es .
connect air @-@ devices high speed and acceleration in narrow@@ est room .
you can also build self @-@ resi@@ li@@ ent structures .
you have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to cross the boundaries of the possible flight .
in order to become an autonomous system , it must be collec@@ tively perceived , where the mobile objects are located in the space .
in our laboratory at ET@@ H Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this allows us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alizing technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
every flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , determine what the machine should do .
external commands are available on the highest point . e.g. , &quot; start &quot; and &quot; landing . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called stern starter ,
a flight machine , trying to beat two flying with a f@@ lap .
like other star@@ ring , it is efficient in advance , much more efficient than helicopter in all their variations .
unlike most star@@ ring flights , it can float , and has a great advantage with start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of stern @-@ star@@ ters is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ence such as wind b@@ ays .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft is able to reg@@ ain the optimum position and can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask basic abstract questions , which penet@@ rate the core of the matter .
such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to answer the answer to such question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts , which are un@@ amm@@ able to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots managed to fly remote control units that only had two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ ster .
un@@ recently , we discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically @-@ controlled flight machine . it was invented recently .
there is only a moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no valves , hing@@ es and cross section , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although mechan@@ ically simple , it happens in the inner life much so that it can fly stable , and can move anywhere in space .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern . to get it to fly , I have to throw it right .
the chance to throw it exactly right when all of you see is low , therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
if the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in pleas@@ ur@@ ness , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this over@@ flow ?
they see that he is only symmet@@ ric .
therefore , it is ambitious in its orientation .
as a result , he receives the extraordinary ability to achieve ,
to move in space in all directions , no matter what direction he is turned or even as he rot@@ ates .
naturally , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight Prop@@ eller .
a lot is displayed in models , the rest is lear@@ nt right when flying .
let &apos;s see that .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller machines .
this revol@@ ves clock@@ wise
and the other counter@@ clock@@ wise .
when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , something goes wrong -- a engine or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or battery - can fly the machine if also restricted .
we will demonstrate that , by making a half f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration exam@@ ines synthetic swar@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a p@@ allet of an aesthetic expression .
we took commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one disc bread -- and out@@ fit them with loc@@ alizing technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in the room she is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully , you will motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine since it would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us , the reward is in development and the creative act .
it serves as a memory , how wonderful and ench@@ anting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creature allowed to form it so spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive and economical potential , the dot turns on the i .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , in a very far distant galaxy , two black holes were getting closer and faster , they turned into pure energy so the mass of three years .
for this short moment they ligh@@ tened brigh@@ ter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
they did not put their energy in form of light freely --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time plum@@ ge itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we arrange the events at first time .
about 1.3 billion years ago , a multi @-@ cell life was created on earth .
since then , Earth has brought a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , dinosau@@ rs , humans and -- God arise - even the internet .
some 25 years ago , a group of particularly brave -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver have decided to build a gigantic laser detector to seek gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are created by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them held it for crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy genius so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely much hard work they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the Laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ ry Gra@@ vit@@ ation Observ@@ atory .
in the after@@ math , the precision of Lig@@ o could significantly increase , which increased the recognition output enor@@ mously .
therefore , one calls him advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clari@@ fy some smaller , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ro@@ uting the two col@@ li@@ zed black holes through the earth .
they walked through you and me
and through the detector .
Scott Hughes : just two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the departure from my to@@ d@@ sick father .
basically , that was the fruits of my life .
all that , what I had worked for , is not longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studied gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves from black holes and their through observ@@ atories , such as Lig@@ o @-@ measur@@ able signals .
a gra@@ vit@@ ation wave is a sp@@ ells in the form of space and time .
while passing the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction , and into the others .
to illustrate , lec@@ turers in courses of rel@@ ativity @-@ theory often lead a really al@@ ber@@ y dance .
&quot; stretching and dust , stretching and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched by the waves of the waves and gest@@ ure . the strain of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is , 20 N@@ ul@@ len , according to the comm@@ a , followed by one of the first one explained the Lig@@ o employees for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and that &apos;s absurd , this length would have to be measured less than a thou@@ sand@@ th of the radius of a atomic fact . this is gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classic text on Gra@@ vit@@ ation
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves like this : &quot; the technical difficulties of construction of such det@@ ectors are massive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cist are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public certainly all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne released this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott claims to be more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell phone .
this is quite practical . because so you can manufacture one image or a map of things by giving you all the light @-@ coming light around you .
with pot@@ ter it &apos;s different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
therefore , it is very difficult to make a picture of things that mean especially much :
about the face of your child .
instead we wait for certain characteristics such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume , to close to the story behind .
&quot; now it &apos;s just Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; drummer Bob &quot; .
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot produce some simple images of objects in all .
but by making changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least , for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave pattern in sh@@ ale , we can hear all literally .
to listen to the gra@@ vit@@ ation , we can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , which my colleague Scott has already been busy .
SH : two black , not rotating holes , just circular : w@@ up@@ p !
the two bodies rotate very quickly , you can hear the same circular with an additional ton@@ al change . this sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a sort of motion @-@ like , shaped into the wave form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that &apos;s at least I never forget -- heard Lig@@ o the following : &#91; Sur@@ render sound &#93; no one knows what he needs to hear is recogni@@ zes this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold sun mass which turns around as fast as the sticks of your mixer .
AA : let us think about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 son@@ es , the other with a mass of 36 son@@ es , revol@@ ve every hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine this forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it , because we have heard it .
therein lies the lasting importance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o is a completely new way to investigate the universe as it was never possible before .
on this way , we can listen to the All , and hear the invisible .
lots of things we can - practical or basically -- do not see .
a Super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why mass @-@ pon@@ ds stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de .
they are very useful . of them we have learned a lot about that .
the thri@@ lling physical processes occur in the core , which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon , and silicon .
we will never pass through because these op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be transparent glass . the Ur@@ b@@ ang : I &apos;d like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it as the original button is conce@@ aled through its own after@@ g@@ low .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible , back to the beginning .
and most import@@ antly , I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen and of whom we have no idea . things we only discover by hearing .
in fact , Lig@@ o did not find things in the first course of things we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the species of stars that produce black holes like Lig@@ o they are watching are the dinosau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are the su@@ ction cups for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o enables us to view a completely different perspective on the events in all , to the emergence of the stars and ultimately , as we came out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge is now to be as cour@@ ageous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build great det@@ ectors and l@@ ur@@ king the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and all .
for what could be more beautiful than the pri@@ ck itself ?
now the time is great dreams .
do you dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried a experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one year long , I would say to everything &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
would I have to be live on TV live ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start with the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a crazy thing happened to do exactly that , when I was afraid , my fear was removed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my fear , talking , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; my life changed .
&quot; yes , &quot; I changed .
but there was a certain Yes , which changed my life on an un@@ expect@@ edly art . it started with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , called for un@@ explained reasons all the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cookies I need milk for my be@@ ak door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she once asked me if I could play with her , when I was right on the jump . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this was the beginning
a new life setting in my family . from there on I told me to always play with them . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I say always Yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired .
it has a magic effect on me , my children , to our family .
but it &apos;s also an aston@@ ishing side effect : only recently , I was fully understood that the &quot; Yes &quot; S@@ agen to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think things , consider your life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I produce television .
I do television , in big style .
in this TV @-@ season , I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of programs to the world .
four TV programs , 70 @-@ hour TV . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each program offers hundreds of jobs that didn &apos;t exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV channel can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode all nine days in four shows , so all nine days of TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three shows that simultaneously in production are four , 16 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for one season .
in America , my TV series runs each other on Thursday night .
my series runs in 256 regions for 30 million viewers around the world .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I &apos;ve created , and not only produced , so still ob@@ st@@ ine . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to assemble my fans , and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of TV , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who makes it still ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you .
I tell it because I know what you think , if the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you , that all of you , who work so hard , whether you say a company , a country or a class@@ room to take me seriously when I say of work , so that I &apos;m not just around the computer and imagin@@ ative that I say : I understand that there is no dream during a dream job .
it is all a job , everything work , everything reality , all blood , everything sweat - not tears .
I &apos;m working much , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m going to work in the job , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is when I set up troops as a painting I painted on a screen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so as dre@@ aming of a high clay , you run a marathon .
it feels like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and maternal , cru@@ el@@ ly and maternal , cruel and reasonable , and the best of it is the sum@@ s .
there is so a change in me when working is well underway .
a sum@@ s starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum@@ s listen like a busy street , I could drive forever .
many people assume , when I say to them the sum@@ s that I speak writing that writing is joy for me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does them .
but the sum@@ s -- when I started working with television production , when I began working and work and work , build , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy .
the bu@@ zz is more than writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the tot@@ als is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum , then you cannot stri@@ ve different to size .
the feeling that cannot be different than to size , no matter what price .
this is called the sum@@ s .
or perhaps it also means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it &apos;s called Gen@@ ie .
perhaps it is ego .
maybe it &apos;s the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I just know that I am not in failure , and I only know that I love the sum@@ s .
I just want to say to you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to ask it in question .
to be clear : the more successful I will ever more shows , the more episodes , the more work there , the more things at the same time , the more I write it , the more I write history , the more expectations it is .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country , which I create , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I just this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stop .
revised , revised , exagger@@ ated , burned down .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now , my three daughters were acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth , that their mom@@ my is a single working environment .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sh@@ k@@ itt@@ ens I want to go to Sh@@ onda country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are the children of one tit@@ els .
they are Baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s heard .
the sw@@ ath of the engine was speech@@ less .
I don &apos;t love my work anymore . the engine was out .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same title work , 15 hours days , practic@@ ed weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ating , a Titan sleeps does not exist , with all heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show @-@ Titan ,
everything was grey , I simply had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s I was .
so what does one do , if what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ?
I know some might think : &quot; Heu@@ l , &quot; the author of the author Titan . &quot;
but you know you are doing , you &apos;re working to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker to be a teacher , a teacher , Bill Gates , one loves just another and this gives you a sum@@ s , when you knew the sum@@ s , when the sum@@ s stop , who is one then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
if the song of my heart ce@@ ases , I can survive in the still@@ ness ?
and then I imag@@ ined my &quot; South America &quot; wa@@ it@@ ress .
I &apos;m on the way out , late and she says : &quot; m@@ um , do you like playing ? &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to say no , when two things are conscious of me :
firstly , I have to say Yes to everything and second , she called me not &quot; Sh@@ k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t call anyone more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sh@@ ears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did this happen ?
I miss it when I &apos;m in Titan and my sum@@ s , and here everything changes before my own eyes .
and so she says , &quot; Mama , do you like playing ? &quot;
and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
it is nothing special .
we play and their sisters down , we laugh so much and I read from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding , because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness , and lack of sense , I cannot do anything except to watch .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country , which I create , the marathon which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they do not exist anymore .
everything that exists are sti@@ cky finger and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wa@@ ist pins and the song in which it &apos;s about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; Die Eis@@ Queen &quot; won .
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can &apos;t believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
an mental door goes on and an energy boost is coming in .
and that &apos;s not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s slowly comes back .
there is no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the bu@@ zz , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel like I would know a magic mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it &apos;s something we have forgotten .
the sum@@ s , the work@@ men , the shares of titanium , is just the substitute .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I am writing by using ship@@ ments and TV hours and how working my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is .
the Sum@@ ma is not force , and it is not working specifically .
it depends on the joy .
the real sum@@ s is dependent on love .
the tot@@ als is the electricity that comes from the lust of life .
the real Sum@@ ma is Self @-@ Consci@@ ousness and Peace .
the real sum@@ s igno@@ res the pressure of history , which are experiencing the experience , expec@@ tation and pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , because what God told me that I am a titanium ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I make this solid rule , so I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic of every fault .
it is a law , I have no other choice . I do not have any other choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in games , I don &apos;t like it .
do not play at me in the same way as working .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer to go at home as at home .
this conc@@ ession is painful , because what a man does rather work as a house ?
well , I guess .
hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed , none of them .
we are around in the garden , before and back , round and forth .
we do small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we cr@@ ush soap bubbles .
I feel predominantly sti@@ ff , absent , and confused .
I always att@@ acker to my mobile phone .
but it is OK .
my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe ful@@ fil@@ s me .
I play and play , until I ask myself : why did we ever stop playing with the game ?
you can also say ! they always say Yes , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you &apos;ll keep me for nai@@ ve , for a day dre@@ amy .
there you are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you also know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child finds you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes , until they see that they want to do something else .
there are wonderful 15 minutes , but only 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , a Mari@@ enk@@ ir@@ fer or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and my Teen@@ ie @-@ daughter speaks for a whole 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are only 15 minutes , more needs not .
everyone can take 15 minutes on a piece , even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes on a piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no di@@ stra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the kids are ready to bed .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my dear lo@@ ase , my world . it must not be the children . it is true that sum@@ s feel to have a place for his soul peace .
it &apos;s not about playing with his own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
around the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself in the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out and keep it out .
I &apos;m not perfect there . I &apos;m afraid and I victories . meet friends , reading books , enjoy the day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in the training when I wanted to do more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on a piece , why not allow you to indul@@ ge in 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my free time . the sum@@ s seem to be back when I &apos;m not working .
work does not work without any games .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door opens up and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown mel@@ ody , it ful@@ fil@@ s me and my soul . she re@@ direc@@ ts me to new ideas . I use it in full gul@@ ps and love my work again .
I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s isn &apos;t me ... not more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is now my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just one part . and I am so grateful for that .
it is me that I am a titanium . I have never seen a Titan , who plays a trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and to more games .
and yet , I have everything in handle . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the more happy I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as good mother .
the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the country , I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ets , the high clay , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more makes this unusual , be@@ ating , naked and new life feeling in me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel like this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I am author . I think things , I consider you to live .
this is a job , which means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and to play more .
titles have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you nice .
I am Neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a heavy stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ surgeon it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self healing .
after severe injury of the central nervous system , patients often have lasting , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became functional Neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve function through different surgical measures .
sure , they have heard from one of the most well known , the &quot; deep cereb@@ ell@@ in@@ ople . &quot; we im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neurological function improves .
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease which suffered severe so@@ aking and serious pain .
however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ Cure .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close .
with some help , the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time , I was a Senior Consult@@ ant and was working day and night in the emergency department .
I often supplied patients with sk@@ ul@@ ls @-@ Hir@@ n trau@@ ma .
they must imagine that brain @-@ brain trau@@ mas increases the brain and increases the skull pressure .
in order to save life , you have to dimin@@ ish the skull pressure .
sometimes you need to remove a s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we determined with Jean François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist who analyse brain mass .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells out of this tissues .
this is no easy task .
to grow from a tissue equivalent , comparable to small children that are taken out of your families .
one must find the right diet , temperature , humidity , and environments to thri@@ ve it .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean François abol@@ ished .
this he saw under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
maybe you know from the science lessons that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the surgery .
we did a further fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are imm@@ ortal .
but these cells remained differently .
they share slowly and after a few weeks , they died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population which looked like stem cells but kept it differently .
we needed for a long time to understand how they came .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ell@@ ar cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us , they take care of the brain .
but why do they get us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain , since we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
this is not so sure .
one thing is clear -- however , of these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand before a potential cell source , which allows brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we determined to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then cultiv@@ ate cells as well as Jean François Hollande
and then , to mark them colored , to track them in the brain .
in the last step , we im@@ planted them at the opening act of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we re@@ im@@ planted these cells into normal tissue tissue ? and what will happen if we are re@@ im@@ planted in the same brain tissue tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario re@@ im@@ planted , we observed the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that they had been taken completely after a few weeks , go back home . the room is already occupied , they will not be used there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario there was a violation and re@@ im@@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- it grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were re@@ im@@ planted .
the evidence that they show are these small points . these are the cells that we in vitro , in the culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkeys to recover from a cereb@@ ral inf@@ rin@@ gement ?
so we trained Mon@@ keys with a manual skill task .
you had to take food pellets for one tablet .
they did it very well .
when they achieved a stable skill level , we were injured in the mot@@ ic c@@ ort@@ ex machine .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could not move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen to people , they recovered spont@@ aneously to a certain degree , just like after stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to rec@@ u@@ per@@ ate with the help of plastic mechanisms . you are re@@ covering to a certain degree , just like the monkeys .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left hand , they see the monkeys that recovered spont@@ aneously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its initial performance from inf@@ rin@@ gement .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now see when we re@@ im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the char@@ m@@ plant@@ ation .
I can tell you , that &apos;s very exciting for us too .
since that time we have found very much more about these cells .
we can freeze it and later use .
we can use them in other neurop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ pl@@ ate them with people .
I really hope that I can show you soon , as the human brain gives the means to heal herself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know somebody who can need it . &quot;
I definitely definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from this great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies .
BG : it is understand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a very professional team .
BG : looking into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to launch the clinical trials . if you continue to see in the future , how many years it takes until somebody gets to the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to do this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients that carry out treatments and evaluate it , whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
afterwards , you have to apply this to a multi @-@ center study .
one must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you tell us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
in the West , we are making a big mistake , as of course , to consider .
we do not see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant that is in reality , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to look at them as un@@ changeable ti@@ ghtness .
we believe capitalism inev@@ it@@ ably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy comes with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece - the newly elected Greek government -- was clear to me as finance ministers in the Euro@@ group - was clear to me that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- do not influence the savings schemes that have been achieved in Greece .
at that moment , I thought that there could be no better jus@@ tification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my in@@ geni@@ ous friends who repeatedly say that democracy would abol@@ ished if they would change anything .
at this point , I want to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , again to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group will believe a mistake , we could save ourselves democracy , but that we need a truly credi@@ ble democracy .
because without democracy our societies are m@@ ashed out , our future no@@ ster and our great , new technologies are w@@ asted .
on the subject of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contra@@ diction , which currently threat@@ ens our economies .
I call it the &quot; twins summit parad@@ ox . &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the debt mountain that poses its long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the debt mountain ,
but only few are aware of his Di@@ dy@@ mus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mountain of un@@ washed cash which , however , to be anxi@@ ous to invest it there , where it would be productive and income , with whom you might want to produce the debt of debt , and even all the things that humanity are desper@@ ately needed , for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars were invested in the United States , in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office building , schools , streets , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 trillion dollars is like a lot of money , until it compar@@ es it to the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions around the same time , and absolutely nothing was doing , except the stock ex@@ changes and the real estate prices .
thus , liabilities and un@@ productive capital constitute the twins of twins that do not compens@@ ate through the usual market mechanisms .
the result are stagn@@ ant wages , more than one quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently ar@@ ising a low demand that will not invest in which they will not invest . exactly as Ö@@ di@@ pus &apos;s father , who would kill him if his son would kill him if he will grow up ,
un@@ inten@@ tionally , the circumstances leads to the circumstances that Ö@@ di@@ pus kills him .
that is my shar@@ ks with capitalism .
his extremely w@@ ast@@ eful intention should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents , and especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for salvation of the earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we proceed : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ eles defined democracy as the form of form , in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy comes naturally too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to under@@ mine the job value of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy .
the decisive thing about the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that she gave them the working poor , and not only the right to freedom of expression , but is more important and crucial that they admitted to them the right to political participation with the same mood in matters of the State alliance .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not been held long ago .
like a candle that lights very bright , she is also burned down quickly .
however our current liberal democra@@ cies don &apos;t have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens and the working arms ampli@@ fies , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Cart@@ a , who ultimately became a stat@@ ute for controlling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was imposed on politics , while the economy -- and the world of the corporations -- a democratic zone was formed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in our current democra@@ cies , since the time , on which this separation of politics and economy began , an un@@ successful struggle between the two , and the economy gradually emigrated to politics and dis@@ emp@@ owers them .
are you wonder@@ ing why politicians are no longer like ?
it is not at a de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is estimated that people may be in the government today and nevertheless not in power because the power is lost in the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my shar@@ ks with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is in about as a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors that feeds so sustain@@ ably the animals , of which it feeds itself , dec@@ im@@ ated that at the end it is hungry .
it is similar to the economy that the policy has become so far @-@ channel that it grows through the self @-@ induced economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations is increasing , the economic demand is increasing , and the managing director of the corporations have become anxi@@ ous to invest the cash of their businesses .
the more successful capitalism the &quot; demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; exp@@ els from democracy , the higher the twins summit , and the greater the waste of human labour and the welfare of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring together the policy and the economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; keep control , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Marx@@ ist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t really good .
the teachings of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms are re @-@ reg@@ ained only by a miracle of a miracle like in ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : creating the working arms !
capitalism does it by replacing low low cost workers through automation and robots .
the problem is that so long economy and politics are separated areas , the automation makes the twin summit higher , the waste of waste , and the social conflicts deeper , like it -- already very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
so , we need to re@@ shape the economy and unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we can democra@@ tically make the unified area , otherwise we will conclude in a path@@ ogenic surveillance @-@ hyp@@ er tie , which leaves the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentation .
so the question is not , whether capitalism has emerged to survive the technical accompl@@ ishments that it emerged .
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is like a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; matrix , &quot; or something similar to the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines serve the human being , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans , &quot; in long talks the sense of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what does it mean , how could it look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples .
in the area of companies : please introduce a capital market in which one deserves money while you are working and in which your capital follows you from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter what you are working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company .
then all income from capital and income from funds and the concept of wages are completely over@@ hau@@ led .
there are no differentiation among those who belong to the company , but it does not belong to them , and employees working there , but no exchange between capital and labour , no great g@@ aps between investment and sp@@ ar , and ultimately no emp@@ oral twins summit .
in the area of global political economy : just imagine that our national currencies would have a free exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in interest of all mankind .
continue to imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the Cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and any government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the commercial surplus of the country , into a common fund .
imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods conference from 1944 .
the problem was that , at that time , it was not the technical means to implement it .
today , in particular , we have them , especially in the background of a united politics and economy .
the world that I describe you is at the same time , in which they prefer privileged persons , and mar@@ x@@ istic , because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in tr@@ ash of history , and key@@ nesi@@ an , globally key@@ nesi@@ an .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world ?
or are we in a &quot; matrix &quot; - like a similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as liber@@ t@@ arian mar@@ xi@@ ons .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said is relevant then Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do we do this , the technological development will create a massive decline in total economic demand , which Larry Sum@@ mers described as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
through the transfer of this crisis of a part of Earth to the next , as we can currently experience it , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our democra@@ cies , but also the countries , whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is absolutely relevant ,
likewise Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am totally in@@ verteb@@ r .
BG : indeed , and now we are too .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical statement -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein , who said this . BG : in your presentation , you mentioned Singapore and China , and yesterday at the Red@@ ner dinner you mentioned very clearly what you are holding from the perspective of the West in China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a big level of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
we have a democracy in our liberal democra@@ cies .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most ab@@ uses , -- the area of business -- a totally democratic zone .
in certain ways , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the United Kingdom of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , such as John Stuart Mill --
he was particularly skep@@ tical what concerns the democratic development .
what can be seen now in China , resem@@ bles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now attemp@@ ting to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells amazing to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experiences as finance minister in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I knew that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back to the first half of six months later ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely , to say goodbye to compl@@ ac@@ ency , and to deny that a massive deteri@@ oration is passed through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union .
we had the opportunity on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first suggestion was to reveal this den@@ ial --
right to do . unfortunately , the powers in the Eurozone , within the European group , continued to den@@ ies the den@@ ial .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try a economic system that is not viable , through political will and Auth@@ or@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism , you may have gone out for a while , but if the change happens , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what change do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change their structure .
BG : did you have any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Harvest ...
if there is a Minister for Finance , or any minister , who was in office after 6 months , especially in such a cl@@ amped situation , he claims to have no mistakes , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the partners of the investors to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they only wanted to bring our government , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the di@@ stortion caused by the Eurozone .
they did not want to admit that they passed a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme for the past 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
none of the Tro@@ ika of the investors who imposed this policy , conf@@ essed : &quot; it was a col@@ os@@ sal@@ er mistake . &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive type of talks , you seem to be quite a pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro zone opposite to anyone who lives and loves Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my greatest fear is that the Eurozone won &apos;t survive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for if they did not survive , the released fly @-@ workers will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not have disast@@ rous consequences for Europe alone , but for the whole world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we push ourselves the way to a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it appears to me , it will also be unbe@@ ar@@ able for the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you very much that you were at T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thanks .
Roy Price has never heard of Roy Price , although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you .
this goes back to the decision , the Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company at Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a term and describes on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Movies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are already so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t select any .
he must find shows , which are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are located very right on this curve .
this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the evaluation is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are received this evaluation .
will your show be evaluated with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Breaking Bath , &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where , when you saw a season , your brain asks , &quot; Where are there any more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left @-@ hand side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that was to tell you enough what is going on at the end of the curve .
Roy Price does not take care of the left side of the curve , because I don &apos;t need special intelligence to offer &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the middle exclusion , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they are simply not am@@ aze .
so he must make sure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing something , so Roy Price wants nothing to risk .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he stops a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and chose an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and sets them online , where they can watch everyone free .
and if Amazon is free for free , it is correct , right ?
millions of viewers look at these episodes .
however , they do not know they are watched when viewing this shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team , who record everything .
you capture when you start the show when you p@@ au@@ ded , what parts you ski@@ ps or check again .
they collect millions of data to decide with these data , which show it they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process this and from this results the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four republi@@ can U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they did that show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many people can remember this show because it was not so good .
it is only an average show -- in the true meaning of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House ends at 7.5 -- so somewhat above the average but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time with another company , another manager has set a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super @-@ show and he also uses data , but he does something different .
instead of organizing a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data about Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews that they give the shows , whose course they like shows , etc .
then they take advantage of these data to find out these little details about the spectators : which shows them , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the pieces together , they went a venture and decided not to make a Sit@@ com about four stations , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has made a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets an 9.1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course , the question is : what is happening here ?
we have two very strange , data sealed companies .
they connect these many data , and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this about ?
because logic somehow says that it should work in all .
if you collect millions of data , a decision you should meet , then you should make a good decision .
it has 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
you optimized it with a very powerful computer .
the worst thing you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis doesn &apos;t work , then this is a bit sc@@ ary because we &apos;re living in a time in which we reach more and more about statistics , to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ health system is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come in touch , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison in the USA and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dis@@ miss@@ al takes place or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results generated . it is not that a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
the data se@@ al@@ est companies are sometimes wrong .
yes , even Google makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that they can be prec@@ lu@@ ded by data analysis of flu , which can be lim@@ iting - by data analysis of the Google research .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news release . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked just fine , year round year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it simply didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the release of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data are experienced by Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
in spite of all these mistakes , data may occur in decisions of life -- at the workplace , where legal changes , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I recognized some patterns that the difference between successful decisions using data and non @-@ successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
as a replacement , you divide this problem into its components , so that you can analyse the items ; as a second one , put the items together again to summar@@ ize a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to put the pieces together again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something that is good in which the brain is good , it &apos;s parts and pieces to put together again , even if the information is in@@ complete to write a good decision -- especially if it &apos;s the brain of an expert .
therefore , I think was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process .
they utili@@ ze data to better understand their audience , what else they would have been unable to put , but the decision to put together all these parts , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; that doesn &apos;t stand in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , however , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first when they chose TV ideas , then they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
it was a safe decision , because they always could say : &quot; we tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool , and to forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it &apos;s also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; and it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question , you only need to shake the ball to get a reply . &quot; highly likely &quot; -- just this moment .
I &apos;ll get it later with a technique demo .
I have made some decisions in my life so far , with what I should have heard in the ball on the ball .
but , as you can , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by something wei@@ ght@@ less , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so perhaps the ball is wis@@ er and wis@@ er . finally , it &apos;s about us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner .
and I feel it as a very encouraging message that , despite the great amount of data , it is necessary to make decisions , an expert in what to do , and risks involved .
because at the end , it is not the data , but the risks , which you end at the right end of the curve .
thank you nice .
