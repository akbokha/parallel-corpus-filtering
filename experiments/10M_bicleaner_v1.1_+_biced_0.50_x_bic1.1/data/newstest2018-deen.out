Munich 1856 : four maps that change your view to the city
an Irish institution where young people are supposed to meet .
a tomb where the tunnel is dug up for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ dener gra@@ bbed the in@@ geni@@ ous basis of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it &apos;s annoying when maps are not currently present .
everyone knows , who already had to get exciting , because the auto @-@ Nav@@ i takes place a green meadow .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ l@@ ases , an offer of the ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bayern of the state government , are all other than currently - but therefore very reve@@ aling .
especially when you compare it with current online @-@ cards .
it is then clear how towns and municipalities have changed in the area of Munich &apos;s area since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern Atlas is a Flick@@ r carpet , which is not the same as such .
in the great coverage map , cities and communities were given more detailed maps , so @-@ called Ur@@ als leaves .
these were written according to the Bavarian survey@@ ing administration between 1810 and 1864 and from the first survey@@ ing of Bay@@ erns .
your Client : Napoleon .
the French Armed Forces occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographical survey of Bay@@ erns on behalf of course - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops returned to the Lun@@ é@@ ville peace treaty of February 9 , 1801 , it was today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a wide @-@ nationwide regional card .
Kur@@ für@@ st@@ Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thereby the Bavarian survey@@ ing .
the certificate for Munich dates from 1856 and is like all others found on the Bavarian Library &apos;s website .
the comparison of the capital / today is the most impressive example of the country &apos;s capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is under@@ send@@ ling , which is still relatively isolated in the 1856 map .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. 1877 , in the Munich district .
today , Unter@@ send@@ ling lies in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ send@@ lings are concentrated in 1856 along the today Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the insur@@ rection of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where the West@@ park remains , you can see nothing but fields - at the first glance : in execution zo@@ oming a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ writing numbered pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ als , &quot; derived from which the basic tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots are not shown there today no farmers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but small hus@@ band@@ men in the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 event of the Oktober@@ fest , has actually been a meadow in the 19th century , and there was no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the jud@@ ging sheet , one reads not only the street name &quot; at the host name &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or from the hill &quot; At the lu@@ de &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here on the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once opened people with ins@@ ets .
in 1858 / 59 , the Munich circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; was created on the Au@@ er Lü@@ th .
from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard directed the establishment of a psychiat@@ rist who was promoted to King Ludwig II &apos;s death in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; he was advanced for his time and ended , for example , the chains of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren .
in addition , he instructed the staff to tackle violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients had been first place , later extended to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity could no longer be sufficient - the foundation for the construction of the Kreis@@ ir@@ pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary in the hair of 1905 .
there has been the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts in Germany since 2006 .
in the area of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt , teenagers will meet in Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um now .
the order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth house with training courses .
the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 they established the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; - in an architectural reference to the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt who had been destroyed during the World War II bombing .
the mari@@ en@@ platz was in 1856 as &quot; main place , &quot; the department of the department was named &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot;
the Second World War carried out a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the Allies destroyed many holes in the city in December 1944 .
a big remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English institute , small business houses and a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle from the Middle Ages were once alive at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days are working on the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn family .
with the sli@@ der gli@@ der , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil Rights Group Announ@@ ces Travel to Mis@@ souri
the National Association for the promotion of Far@@ mers made a warning for colored people , who are travelling due to discrimin@@ atory politics and rac@@ ist attacks by the state to Mis@@ souri .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Advisory for the Federal State of Mis@@ souri , who , until 28 August 2017 , urges af@@ ro @-@ American trav@@ ellers , visitors and mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , where a series of frag@@ ile , racial @-@ based accus@@ ations occur in recent times throughout the state and indicated here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Group &apos;s opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently adopted law of Mis@@ souri , which makes it difficult to win dis@@ crimin@@ ation against minorities , as well as the law en@@ forcement agencies of the state , which aim in@@ compar@@ ably to minorities , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; they have injuries to civil rights that happen to humans .
they will stick together because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ souri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star .
&quot; we hear dis@@ comfort in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA .
the Group identified inci@@ dents of the rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ souri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances of the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the journey through the State , and was accused by the police of Mis@@ souri by a crime .
the Council also refers to a recently published report by the Office of Mis@@ souri Office , which is shown that black drivers in the state will be held 75 percent more frequently than white .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and informed their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ souri , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people have to be willing to bring it to the cow@@ ard@@ ess or the relatives , that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ souri posted 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the Order of Hass@@ elt Report from the FBI , which entered the state in terms of number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country .
the travel warning is also a response to a new Mis@@ souri Act which would make it more difficult to su@@ e a company for housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued it@@ iner@@ aries for Texas and Arizona , having agreed to commit local law en@@ forcement agencies to re@@ lie@@ ve people because of immigration rules , which will contribute to the AC@@ L@@ U .
travel tips are usually issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs to other countries , but at the last time stakeholders have used the measure of reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States .
Wei@@ gh@@ tly Project is elem@@ ental
the Fish@@ b@@ acher Wei@@ dec@@ au@@ n project is a successful project and continued in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Parliamentary Group Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have taken a picture on the spot .
representatives of the Fischer@@ ha@@ acher CD@@ U @-@ outskirts met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs .
Markus Schwen@@ demann initially made insights into his operation , with 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows , and as well as many young animals and houses in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative solution for the milk of his cows , so swi@@ v@@ elling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a regional office comes to the table of the Feri@@ a .
since he is also the BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fish@@ bach , he called the &quot; elem@@ ental project as &quot; elementary . &quot;
I can &apos;t generate on one @-@ way surfaces .
the green area of land for a lot of work , much has to be edited with the engine sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been strug@@ gling with the conditions and the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; swi@@ vel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the el@@ ter@@ ish operation and management of these without chemical plant protection and fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers , even if he does not lead a bi@@ ologic operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e recognised the importance of the course and is glad about the leader of the leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at a cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare would have to be supported .
one hope that the performance of the surfaces could be moved throughout a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have , people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mayor faces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often because of promoting often in criticism
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the open surface area is 40 hectares , which must not be upgraded by at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total costs of 71 500 Euro , half of the total cost was promoted by leader , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fish@@ bach .
consequently , the farmers had to invest 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained swi@@ vel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not make a really good job , without farmers and land@@ lords . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Peter White stood also : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is the best food produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the land@@ scap@@ ed refugees ( l@@ p@@ r ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables public funding from f@@ ences .
the goal is to release the Schwar@@ zw@@ alds .
pre@@ mise is the presence of one of the l@@ p@@ r recorded conveyor drop .
in addition , the area should not be dra@@ gon@@ ad@@ able ( hang@@ incl@@ ination above 35 per cent ) and must be threatened by rest@@ or@@ isation .
the request of eight participants with 24 plots , which would build up to 16 kilometres of fence in 2018 for the fisher@@ man &apos;s course of 2018 .
the open surface area is equivalent to 35 hectares , representing a total cost of more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing sacred anymore ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking part of the Statue of Liberty
the most secure character of a regime change is when they start to attack the statues .
the Americans estimate these as well as any other - hence the ass@@ ort@@ ment of Saddam Hussein &apos;s ass@@ ort@@ ment on the Fir@@ dos place in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump @-@ regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CNN concerning the proposals from the pre@@ occupying forces of the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of owners poss@@ essions and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ators would have syn@@ ched him if he had done it .
but he gra@@ bbed their importance , and in particular the importance that it was attributed to , as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base was added .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ained : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a full thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tened the world .
the poem , which you refer to , was later added and not part of the original statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is fac@@ tual right , but as he form@@ ulated it , it is not really about history .
it &apos;s about the contemporary reson@@ ance on the up@@ set words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; your arms , your arms , and the fur@@ ious waste of your rich coastal waters . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ eventh apost@@ asy &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made sure that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural meditation : it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after her death at the base - knew very well that they did a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ ans by presenting the female em@@ bo@@ diment of freedom in a worn classical display .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no more abstract - she received a voice .
and there is a completely different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist Cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue , the people wanted to change this long before .
the great cry of Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty came to no one , but rather an early neo@@ conservative that the American flame goes into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty continues .
it is supposed to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch is not to light the way to the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh found here on something .
the importance of the statue is quite and even a matter of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was in it to see them as they were seen from the exhaus@@ tible , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible trips on the ships of ships .
it is in the true sense that the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and have a chance to improve their lives .
their statue says to them the words of hope , and of the will they must hear .
and this is of course not the perspective , the Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to recognize .
her tor@@ ch shall not cause the way , but hatred , who is the only source of power , ign@@ ite .
world championship 2017 : Neil Black is a Scottish members of the United Kingdom
E@@ ili@@ ie Doyle remembers a time when only two Schot@@ ts belonged to the Team of Great Britain
the performance director of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent of Scottish cont@@ ingent is a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record count of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 on Friday .
black believes that &quot; something special is being developed in Scotland , &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand and we will continue until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals @-@ candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ cher - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah over 5,000 m , while E@@ ili@@ ie Doyle was elected president of the team captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ dh is quite modest .
their surrender &quot; speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , no matter whether they were Scottish or where ever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ ie brought quite naturally , were great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Commonwealth silver medal winner , who will compete at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les with the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unbeliev@@ ably &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that 16 Schot@@ ts are in the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world &apos;s best total number of athletes in the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
in the past year , the a@@ isle runner Mu@@ ir leads to five British and two European records last year .
it will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m of rounds .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Sch@@ otte , which is one of the great season to observe the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and Anniversary Games .
Doyle remembers her first World Championships , when the only other Scot@@ sman was Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the teams cont@@ esting that she is &quot; very proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also at the medals and also at the Fin@@ als .
&quot; that is so special to be team capit@@ als in it , so it was a great honour within the other members of the team , but to know that my team @-@ mates have voted for me and chosen me , makes it something special for me , &quot; added them .
&quot; obviously I &apos;m very proud of all the Schot@@ ts that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as established athl@@ ets , athletes who want to climb to Po@@ ships .
regarding my speech as captain ?
yes , I think it went well .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home World Championship .
so it &apos;s really important to set on this home support and benefit from it , we are back in the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go there and compete , and it &apos;s just going to be a great atmosphere there . &quot;
block from critics on Facebook : do not strike your public office if you don &apos;t wear the heating of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington but it did not long until the newspapers beat him because of all , from the Domestic Policy up to his political principles .
he looked at the cri@@ tique , certainly .
but he didn &apos;t put his critics silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech may be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te , as sheep for the slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Maryland to Maryland Larry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work to be more than Washington .
Ho@@ gan@@ s employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 persons and deleted their opinion on its official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union compl@@ ained to him in the beginning of this week .
the Governor &apos;s staff dismissed the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ vol , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is just Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the nation &apos;s 50 govern@@ ors .
H@@ og@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary heat .
he has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary agent to connect with his voters to de@@ bac@@ le his hair @-@ loose head to chemotherapy on his side .
therefore the block@@ age of people that come to the side of the Govern@@ ors - which is a public forum , which is called officially called and of employees who are paid with public tax @-@ Dollars - un@@ necessarily and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan@@ s spokesperson Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the Governor and argued that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it &apos;s too easy to use the image of tr@@ unks or chambers , or water @-@ filled people , which swing the whi@@ p online .
the Post spoke with some of the real people blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a priest , no tro@@ lls .
they all said their comments resp@@ ect@@ fully , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not prof@@ ane .
the priest quoted the Bible in his post office and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan@@ s Catholic faith .
lawyer &apos;s Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani from Bo@@ wie , MD , was not h@@ ass@@ able , but she asked for Hass@@ elt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented polite that I was disappointed there was no response to hate crimes and other latest news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the comment section of the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people took place in the same subject , then they will be mis@@ regarded as a so @-@ called collective action and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what the employee of the Governor &apos;s &quot; concentrated spam attack , &quot; would others be called &quot; interc@@ ession . &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in previous time when you have done the same that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical conduc@@ tors to collect and burn demonstr@@ ators and bring prot@@ esters to silence and to silence .
but that &apos;s exactly what happens .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials to critic@@ ise that he has critic@@ ised Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is proc@@ laim from Twitter users who were blocked by Twitter feeds .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell in Virginia .
the chairman of the Board of Super@@ visors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County has last the First A@@ sc@@ ment , according to the U.S. District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they appointed a elec@@ torate of their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so hard .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers varied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous correspondence in 17@@ 76 and 1800 .
and even at that time , Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls .
the people who used p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote letters to newspapers that make Washington decisions .
petitions , who critic@@ ised his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ med their office , according to the historical documents that were collected by the online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he didn &apos;t put them silence .
freedom of expression , dis@@ agreements and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes on domestic comfort in Renaissance Club
former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for the next three days on domestic comfort as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , which led to the final round in the Ar@@ cher@@ field Links to the En@@ dr@@ unde , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , has been associated with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he reaches his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from his best , it &apos;s in a great condition .
Jerry made a great job , having fixed this place .
he is a jeal@@ ous supporters of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is pleased to defend a championship for the first time , although he won the European Challenge tour in his 32 @-@ year career as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that feels really special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I won &apos;t defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open since she won them in the year after I had won it out of the program .
back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary OR@@ R , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year , returns to the promotion of the home .
this event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s always a bit more if you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again , and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m happy about how it went to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark McN@@ ish .
OR@@ R and former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belongs to the six Schot@@ t on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond .
the entrance fee is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with an passengers and £ 10 per car with two or more occup@@ ants .
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passive smoking
in the past two decades , fewer people have died due to passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists from the University of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come into a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer resulted in passive smoking waste in the case of passive smoking . &quot; study manager Hei@@ ko Becher .
as a comparison , he returned to this issue from 1994 to this issue .
at that time , there have been 400 lung cancer patients due to passi@@ v@@ rau@@ x per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove themselves as very complex
construction work in the Vill@@ inger Street are in full swing and &quot; reason@@ ably more likely in time , &quot; says the head of the court Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of household connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , because in the underground there is a lot of amounts due to the plans .
the traffic , which always hin@@ ts construction works , represents a big problem for the part of the St@@ ump@@ p company .

poverty and death in the Indonesian gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , they don &apos;t use a stove .
it even uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the P@@ ani@@ ai re@@ ader@@ ship in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province of Papua New Zealand , the house@@ wife normally puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour the hollow rope is taken with eag@@ erly , washed hands and swallowed up .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also carries out her daily work , such as dresses with cloudy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bu@@ cket in a homeless room serves as lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of her husband &apos;s four wives , their fields were assigned .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , too late work can be dangerous : most people are unemployed , and many drink it hard , and there are the soldiers .
&quot; no one dar@@ es it at 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life of the Hochland of Papua New Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a disputed referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders were considered to vote in front of the occupying troops .
an existing movement , which touched for independence against Dutch dom@@ ination , turned back quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains the control of the region , including foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers .
in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Papua New Zealand , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea to the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as isolated as it is desolate . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive away with the car rental .
there are no public transport .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bam@@ boo trees , and from cor@@ ru@@ gated ro@@ ofs , converted from r@@ ust into different gel@@ b@@ brown tones .
only very few Indon@@ esians have made their journey here , sof@@ ten journalists and practically no fore@@ ig@@ ner .

Papua New Indonesia &apos;s poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s golden land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from P@@ ani@@ ai , a high@@ land provincial in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has disman@@ tled the value of 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper .
in addition , Papua New resources are valued at an estimated 78 billion US dollars .
however , these riches are a source of mis@@ ery for the Papua New , ensuring that Indonesia &apos;s mighty military is preser@@ ving a ch@@ oked presence .
a study conducted by 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort ran local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 nearly $ 20 million , including up to 150,000 US dollars to one single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ anian claims after major autonomy thre@@ aten these golden G@@ ans and become mer@@ cil@@ essly treated .
according to the activists , more than 500,000 have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped by the Indonesian military since 1969 , tortured and imprisoned since 1969 .
Mass@@ ages in Pap@@ u@@ as tribe high@@ land in the 1970 @-@ s were filed in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission for Com@@ mit Gen@@ ocide .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Wer@@ den Everything &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a report from the Arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Brisbane from 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities in the previous year are , such as illegal execution and torture - rape and electric sur@@ charges are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the vern@@ ac@@ ular area as Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke about ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Papua New Year in 2014 .
the former Zimmermann assured 27 of the total of 29 districts of Papua New Zealand including P@@ ani@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua New has changed little , and today the locals feel che@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for j@@ ok@@ ov@@ i with the expec@@ tation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , P@@ ani@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ i &apos;s inauguration in October .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols before a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali when two ind@@ on@@ esian soldiers broke out on a motorbike by the darkness .
the rock@@ ed children told them that they should turn their spotlight .
one of the soldiers took a cl@@ ash to her sound and later joined four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , pursued , and struck the group with their mit@@ es , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers was fired into the group of children .
a child , the 16 year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard to hit that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and the things needed on the next day .
about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children were gathered at a football pitch in front of the local police station and the Military commander in order to demand justice .
they wore cr@@ ushing hunting hunting bu@@ ds and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle continuously and a bird singing - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started dra@@ gged stones at police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers sent an order via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses have more than three times resistance , they shoot them dead , &quot; it is said in an official text of TIM@@ E , which was not approved by the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ Fort@@ ress of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the imp@@ ending danger and called for peace and called the crowd to return home .
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I suddenly burst into my left wr@@ ist wr@@ ist , &quot; he said TIM@@ E on the veranda of his colourful wooden house .
kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the sphere came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here .
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cousin , the witness of shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and seek his body to make sure he was it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who carries only a name , the TIM@@ E in a dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . &quot;
the Che@@ ese spec@@ tor of the Papua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said rep@@ orters , that his officers would only &quot; ass@@ ure &quot; because they are attacked .
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people threatening to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua Police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the messages about the kill@@ ings were first filtered on the following day &apos; after Jak@@ arta .
in his three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i stood in Jay@@ ap@@ ura a passionate speech in which he utter@@ ed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and s@@ ware , the historical abuse in Papua New Zealand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so that it will not happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Minister of Security Affairs , Wir@@ anto , said that he establishes a foreign mechanism for sett@@ ling historical human rights ab@@ uses .
but the expressions started almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred before a long time .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ er years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes which have to go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke to the TIM@@ E at Jak@@ arta with TIM@@ E and said he had no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua New Zealand .
instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , which called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which requested more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ ors of bloo@@ dless independence of 1999 said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses were already been taught in Papua New Guinea , including the P@@ ani@@ ai Vor@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of P@@ ani@@ ai victims took such claims against un@@ belie@@ ver .
&quot; I was interviewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear for years .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , are afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in P@@ ani@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military , after he helped him to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought after me , &quot; he says .
the shooting industry didn &apos;t stop .
on Tuesday , the Indonesian police enjoyed the vill@@ agers in P@@ ani@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confron@@ tation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a un@@ conscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , among them also children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ra@@ viol@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
the vill@@ agers were prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s site .
the police said that the vill@@ agers were cast down officers who acted on them by removing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile Brigade ( ind@@ on@@ ese paramil@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one sle@@ w .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were so worried that there will be revenge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the past has been delivered quickly , the TIM@@ E . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called upon that the officers to go into account and withdraw the police Brigade of the police from the territory .
P@@ ani@@ ai was always an accident for the Indonesian government .
the lack of development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the members of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ land of Papua New Zealand .
many joined the &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army who claims to defend the rights of Papua New Guinea by pushing spor@@ adic attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of the Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM guides are from P@@ ani@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response to these thousands of people in P@@ ani@@ ai , thousands of people were arrested and arbitr@@ ary in custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding &quot; national sovereignty . &quot;
some are never diving again .
among the people in Papua New P@@ ani@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is expensive for locals .
bread is equally out of range .
the people here are building everything they eat : especially emer@@ alds , fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women to process four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they reserve the most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold to the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a were only 10,000 ind@@ on@@ ese ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Papua New and the new migrants have grown in greater numbers since the opening of the Nab@@ ire airport .
the few jobs that exist in the region will usually go to the better trained and weal@@ thy migrants .
Papua New Zealand or the necessary capabilities , in order to lead their own company competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there is no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John G@@ ob@@ ai , Chairman of the Council of P@@ ani@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation maintains the eyes of the world from Papua New Zealand .
furthermore , restrictions on the reporting international media are eag@@ erly a@@ ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported due to lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua New Zealand , even though the rare permission was given to the film .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaigns were to raise the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development , not implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ quiet most e@@ ast@@ ern@@ most provinces of Papua New Guinea to report : Visa publishing and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six @-@ Pacific countries - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Salom@@ ons Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; different and widely circul@@ ated injuries &quot; in Papua including P@@ ani@@ ai shooting .
these same countries have seen historically the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the alleg@@ ations of the Group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia still a democratic system , and there is free media , so it is difficult to hide the evidence of human rights violations . &quot;
people want to know that more foreign governments are aware of this .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human right @-@ ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited it on May 4 , they broke their silence and th@@ ron@@ ged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source which also participated in the session but anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but they say that they will probably not be true for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the P@@ ani@@ ai shots , &quot; says G@@ ob@@ ai , the Chairman of the tribe .
he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the P@@ ani@@ ai people know that there is under the constant threat of a common military that is living in poor educ@@ ators and health services .
G@@ ob@@ ai says that the P@@ ani@@ ai people , like other Papua New Zealand , look at their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; he must pay back .
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want righteousness , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation , families of P@@ ani@@ ai cas@@ u@@ alties led a last symbolic act of p@@ ite : the bodies of a victim was buried on a site opposite the police and the military station .
they know they might never get justice , but at least they did not forget the manager of their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with their head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ pers from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest living towers in Dubai in Dubai , and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 337 m high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps by the high @-@ rise in just two years , called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch Tower ) in just two years .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we slept at the fire alarm and at the scre@@ aming of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50th floor down , &quot; told a resident named George ang@@ ab , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais , civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting the fire fighting at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 p.m ) and cooled the building .
the government said it work at the provision of self @-@ catering flats for those affected .
the incident can be revi@@ ved on the security of materials that are used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
a survey by management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage from the cl@@ adding , the outdoor clothing for decoration or insulation , came .
in Great Britain , the police said they believe that the system of plates have contributed to the insulation and disgu@@ ise at the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June to the rapid spread of a fire in June , with which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ Five
the President of the International tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has fallen by his big Davis Cup coup at the general meeting .
at the session in Ho Chi Minh City , the Davis Cup single was only supported for this sport @-@ revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup singles only on two winners , Waf@@ er @-@ thin not supported by the required two @-@ third majority .
they often get very long , but also very well known five @-@ pack @-@ classics will be given to the tradition@@ als .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of member countries voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore only scar@@ c@@ ely missed .
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not adopted the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these i@@ con@@ ical and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hag@@ ger@@ ty said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will continue to work on improving the valu@@ ations .
it wasn &apos;t until the vote , after many in@@ consisten@@ cies , the final has come out to fill the final in a neutral place .

more than 1 of 5 US travelers forbidden to airplane , find out a survey
a survey conducted by passengers showed that more than 20 percent of un@@ consciously or un@@ consciously forbidden objects to control the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , who entered the plane while they acci@@ dentally contributed knives or other items with clin@@ ker .
less than 1 percent claimed they had delayed until they had been mist@@ y with fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition or explo@@ sives .
the survey conducted in more than 1,000 persons - which was carried out by a jet charter service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger trav@@ ellers are more mis@@ leading the rules .
of the respondents agreed that they had attempted to fly with something that was banned from the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als were compared with less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X were .
the most common items that were inten@@ tionally tow@@ ed to T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
in excess of 3 percent , knowing items that were carried out by security control while 2.2 percent of the female respondents , and 3.7 percent of the male respondents have confirmed that they would have been deliberately banned drugs into the plane .
the company said it was interviewed throughout the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally s@@ mu@@ g@@ ware had brought through the airport security and how many would have done it inten@@ tionally .
it is no surprise that people who are most s@@ wis@@ ely s@@ mu@@ g@@ ware - know@@ ingly or un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly - by security , those who were most frequently flying .
however , the company insi@@ sts that T@@ SA policies are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people often are uns@@ afe , which liquids they may take away , or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the biggest amounts of liquids in the T@@ SA are prohibited any liquids .
for a while , the people who T@@ SA could see books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ ing@@ ware .
liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel Order Order
electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to be pleased with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Model Model 3 .
so far , he has so far under@@ estimated that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the consistently triumph@@ ant figures , Tesla CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has revealed a second , less gl@@ amor@@ ous figure for the first time to reveal a less gl@@ amor@@ ous figure : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
Mus@@ k had often applied in the past months with more than 500,000 reservations for the new car , whose delivery is just starting .
now Mus@@ k a dream : of the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3.000 had already been withdrawn .
critics have always noted that , however , that there is only un@@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tesla will pay the € 1000 ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) .
currently , 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations are present , admitted Mus@@ k at a telephone conference with analysts .
but if the cancellation of some twelve per cent of all orders to be a problem , the Tesla boss does not believe .
his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not on demand , but on the production site .
in the past year , Tesla delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
2018 - all models were collected - 500,000 to be one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k currently there are 1800 reservations per day .
who today ordered a &quot; Model 3 , &quot; must be charged at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tesla manages to drive its brand new , never in practice tested production lines with maximum occupancy rate .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to greater del@@ ays , then the ad@@ mitting file could be a problem for Tesla .
because then the company can &apos;t stop un@@ satisfied customers in dro@@ ves in dro@@ ves .
EPA leader P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s for the hes@@ itation of the Obama Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after he had been compl@@ ained of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , Chief of the Environment Protection Agency , adopted its former decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ derived air pollut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , when his agency proved the need for the needs of state environmental authorities to re@@ act faster than previous administ@@ rations .
he did not mention the complaint which was charged with his previous post in a Federal Appe@@ al Court .
it &apos;s about a deadline that was running on 1 October for states to stop the O@@ zone &apos;s standards for the bottom of 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would have been hes@@ it@@ ating a year to study its authority over a year to study the plan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to participate in local decisions or economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was the name of his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s At@@ tor@@ ney of Oklahoma , was a long time a reliable enemy def@@ enses reduce environmental protection regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed to block def@@ ici@@ des , or delay regul@@ ating the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
sudden conversion from Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ id regular roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA authorized to have exceeded his authority when he tried to join the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , oil and gas companies to monitor and reduction of methane sticks .
in one on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that the turn @-@ turn of o@@ zone standards are very simply the read@@ iness of EPA for cooperation with the States due to the complex process of resp@@ ecting the new standards .
&quot; under previous administ@@ rations , the EPA often assumed the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then maintained , established by activists groups and others , and in an agreement set the date for carrying out , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in a regulation by judicial proceedings , and we accept Fri@@ sten seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we also take the law and authority to give it seriously . &quot;
nevertheless , the statement of the EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt took advantage of his &quot; powers to delay and all other legal services available , &quot; to ensure that the regulations are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Congress push for a more comprehensive re@@ shaping of o@@ zone rules .
last month of approval law , the implementation of the 2015 rules should be delayed by at least eight years .
the intervention was not yet made for vote in the Senate .
the New York State At@@ tor@@ ney , Eric Cut@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition led by the states that the EPA promised this week , said the Group intend to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important profit for health and security of these 6.7 million new Yor@@ kers and over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows in their con@@ greg@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York is included in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ ian , Rhode Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .

Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery @-@ area will be invited to the old cemetery @-@ area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.@@ 30 o &apos;clock .
whether his idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z @-@ Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted from this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the place have made friends and sponsors of tum@@ ors for their concerns .
Walter Martin@@ i empha@@ sized : &quot; it is a unique legend . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was mentioned for the first time in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer jungle church : count Hermann of Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the sacred parish church on Tum@@ ors with the V@@ og@@ tei &quot; on Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
the word , according to the certificate , stood on the Tum@@ linger mountain except the ru@@ sty parish church beside the ru@@ sty parish church , which belonged to the Church or the patron , and not vice versa .
so people also lived there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ ite Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 1858 , it was beside the Lower village and the Upper Village that today are still visible in the town of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; Mountain &quot; of the third , the city centre of the village .
old maps from the period around 1600 , these historical circumstances are under@@ going .
the patron was originated from the early medieval owner .
a Lord that built a church , and occupied with a priest , continued the owner of this church , and was able to inherit these suit@@ cases .
this was the right to use a pastor , or to suggest a bishop of a pastor .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two torn at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell , then in 16@@ 92 , had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942 .
during the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) window frames were stolen and the bells were stolen .
the roof was indig@@ nant .
in 1796 French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as a fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to overthrow in 1809 .
until 1869 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius gra@@ vey@@ ard served as the last resting place for the dead from hearing ai@@ ds .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was broken off .
only the cherries had to stand .
in the New Year 1834 , a storm sank the steep@@ le storm and half collapsed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished .
only today &apos;s existing Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g stayed as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ as@@ em cultiv@@ ates the &quot; creative pension@@ er &quot; as the successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn .
as organis@@ ers invite friends and promot@@ er tum@@ ors on Sunday , July 16 , at the sixth seren@@ ade to the old cemetery for St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is designed by the Kepler gramm@@ ar of Kepler &apos;s gramm@@ ar school and with wor@@ ries by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Matt@@ eis .
the town of Hartmut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 a.m .
on the occasion of the seren@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows down to the forest , &quot; the organizers put out the fantastic views .
the seren@@ ade only takes place in dry weather .
the organizers hope for many supporters as ob@@ taining the historical St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is important for tum@@ ours and hearing ai@@ ds .
the Friends and Promot@@ er of Tum@@ our feel very committed to home care , such as Ser@@ en@@ ade organizer , Walter Martin@@ i .
Association wants to check the approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim beha@@ ved &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not look any legal requirement for the construction and has thus turned into the coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ ours &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Coun@@ cill@@ or Andreas Co@@ ils &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( CD@@ U ) to take its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen has only existed at the border with Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal a wind power concentration zone .
within this concentration zone there are construction and operation of wind energy plants possible , at the same time the concentration zone causes wind energy use to the rest of the city area .
such zones are to prevent a &quot; deep@@ ening &quot; of the landscape .
a few days earlier , the city of Vier@@ sen had decided on a second wind power zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but did not appro@@ ves the district government Düsseldorf , due to a defect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planned legal requirement , the granted author@@ isation procedure is un@@ lawful and therefore decre@@ asing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christopher Er@@ k@@ ens , chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of things : the City Council again decided in front of the summer break again in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a approval of the district government is still standing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this place the distribution of approval for the construction of wind energy systems is legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has entered the circle of Vier@@ sen for a week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them on the occasion to re@@ prove the matter again .
however , they do not expect that the procedure is stopped .
with a view on the administrative court at the administration court , the circle was not on Thursday to honor the development of the &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; association .
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette to build four of the 200 metres high wind turbines .
already last year , the company had been involved in which the City of Vier@@ sen has been involved in the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land .
with the construction of the four wind energy plants , the power demand of around 11 400 households can be met - this is equivalent to around one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ sen@@ er households .
the NEW Re @-@ invest some 20 million euros .
in the last summer , Fort@@ y City moved green light to buy three wind turbines at Aachen , Germany as well as a stake in a wind power plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the circle Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crane together : woman dies at terrible accident
a terrible traffic accident took place on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn Circle ) .
a woman was wounded and wounded .
two other people were slightly injured .
the state road remained blocked over hours .
after a police report , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ nich went to bor@@ row with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion for the L 333 towards the Bo@@ gel .
city and tra@@ ders plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
bath@@ robes and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shops in the city in September .
the commercial club and city administration want to take advantage of the weekend on September 8 and 9 to attract inhabitants to the city center .
as the chair of the Trade Union , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend will sensi@@ tis@@ ze the customers that offers their own city away from the usual supermarket goods .
planned is therefore a market with regional vend@@ ors , similar to the weekly market .
native companies are to present themselves with their training plans .
in addition , shops are to invite to the &quot; mit@@ ochondri@@ a sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; shops .
the action is not only on residents of the city and the surrounding area .
in preparation , commerci@@ als are on radio , internet video and printed bag , which point to the promotional weekend , says Christian King .
city administration and commercial association collabor@@ ate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
thus , the commercial club and the city go to another stage of the &quot; attraction center &quot; project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these include new offers as the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Active Day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the Brun@@ nen@@ fest Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ people and owners to move it to active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even attractive offers for Saturday and the reference to parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential will be new or re @-@ opened .
these include tourist guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city center in shopping .
in the end , everyone would have to contribute to the city center - to rent the land@@ lords of all the city and clubs .
it was to come to overcome the le@@ th@@ arg@@ y with a network that ever wider , King has said in the spring .
Birgit Stre@@ ich , head of the I@@ HK Center in Mühl@@ hausen , shared that five Thur@@ ing@@ ian cities take part in the nationwide third &quot; home @-@ shopping day &quot; day .
besides Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode .
the day should adver@@ tise on the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its importance for the common practice of our cities , &quot; says I .
the campaign under the fe@@ at of the I@@ HK and with many partners make it clear that every citizen with its purchase act could influence their direct environment itself .
two dead and several injured after explosion at U.S. school
during construction , there was a gas explosion in the school building .

according to the fire brig@@ ade , Wednesday ( local time ) was still a injured in critical condition .
a man died , when a part of a school building collapsed .
one of the first mis@@ chiev@@ ous was also dead , later dead .
at the dead it was employees of the school .
as a accident , the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline .
only a few people stuck in the building of the Min@@ cher@@ aha Academy .
tr@@ ump set after sc@@ anned tran@@ scription from phone calls to Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump ordered a phone conversation with the Mexican President Enrique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , to say that he would not pay for a planned fron@@ tier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US President proc@@ laim@@ s him because he den@@ ounced the wall openly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ ware to Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Gym have also been released and revealed a decent exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull , that a trade for the US refugees , who emigrated to Australia , would be ridi@@ culous , &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that it would be like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; would look like a ban for the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States .
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had spoken to Mr. Turn@@ halle , &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as calling for justice again
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury passed through a group of spectators in the Rural Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ ank to the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car was able to reach the bridge four black passengers and a white driver , a group of white men came out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man of middle age in a con@@ fer@@ ous strip - took a long train on his cig@@ ar , looking through the wind@@ shield .
inside clos@@ ets the occup@@ ants in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; bre@@ wed the man .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
cry out as a young black man from the passenger seat was torn down .
fortunately , this terrible scene played on July 22nd was only one night .
but when a loop around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; is thrown , almost all of them were in the audience very real sigh@@ s .
since 2005 , civil law@@ makers come back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night , in the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com , as well as George and Mae Murray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was charged with murder .
&quot; it &apos;s really in@@ comprehen@@ sible that in all these years no one person was arrested , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps with the organization &apos;s organization .
&quot; it is a dirt in a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of the state Georgia and a life imprisonment .
for him the follow @-@ up acts as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that an un@@ righteousness was never corrected .
&quot; we want criminal prosecution , we want the termination , we want healing , we want to reconc@@ ile , but at first we have to receive justice , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can &apos;t get healing and reconciliation we will receive righteousness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court medi@@ ator lays a towel on the ly@@ re one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on July 27 , 1946 .
according to the FBI Act , which were received by NBC News , more than 50 men were suspected of Monroe and surrounding coun@@ ties in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but no one was charged ever .
although the susp@@ ects remain on free foot for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch action was always known throughout the city : politics and sex .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice allowed the black citizens into Georgia for the first time to give her voice in the summer campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately at the same time as the election of the FBI , Roger Mal@@ com , according to the FBI , is a white owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - allegedly committed because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that it was rum@@ our in the city that H@@ ester have slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ oth@@ y and that the baby was wearing it , did not come from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white agricultural owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from the prison so the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and their cou@@ sins Mae Murray and George Dor@@ sey in prison .
but when she desc@@ ended from prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge went closer , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b reached the car .
&quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison who has prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; includes an FBI report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution that was not only involved in the murder , proof of evidence and the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks are still form@@ ulated .
&quot; he was an electoral massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register , and if you vote , you will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cass@@ and@@ ra Gre@@ ene has led the annual review of Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de for almost a decade .
their representation is illu@@ stra@@ tive , mature , and is founded in a kind of deep rac@@ ism that many believe in America it is no longer exists .
it &apos;s hard to look and more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ap , because we are then confron@@ ted with their hem@@ or@@ ality in us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to listen to what I have through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - into a room and li@@ cked when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played review about the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ Director .
he played the role of the boss C@@ lan@@ ting for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story alive , because we don &apos;t want to return to those times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room tried the actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester play their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester scre@@ ams and pushed him angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , w@@ ilt from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a provides the fire .
there is a break .
and then each ( at least all black actors ) breaks out into laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lau@@ ght .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; Ras@@ con@@ a asked .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still ki@@ osk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think that white people at that time &apos; n --- &apos; said &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; one of the other black perform@@ ers .
&quot; you only have to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a sense of com@@ rades replacing the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy making this right , not just because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins once again .
this time Ras@@ con@@ a says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely nobody &apos;s laughing .
this re@@ petition ends non@@ violent and fast .
there is scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman clothed with a sack@@ cloth , is talking about the bodies of the actors and leads to cheap holidays &quot; Strange Fru@@ it . &quot;
her voice breaks in every second word .
approximately one hundred metres behind it caught a group of about four dozen spectators and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost evenly divided between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many come down only the street .
they have experienced all over eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as , when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bst@@ ones of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point the kill@@ ings have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels great .
when the latest notes of the song sounds , Gre@@ ene loads the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the dead bodies .
children ho@@ cks in their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; they &apos;re not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy when he wants to remember .
after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene ow@@ es the amount - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ we@@ dge and wi@@ pe her tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w surro@@ unds Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit that the C@@ lan@@ ker played .
Nick Ras@@ con@@ a hu@@ gs two of his te@@ amm@@ ers and then breaks down in her arms , the emotional bur@@ dens of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; whis@@ pers one of women .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done this for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience sat together with the actors for dinner together .
at a table , a white couple from Atlanta excited about the reproduction with a black couple , which they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski strug@@ gled to find words which feel the performance of the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... of people who look like you and those that do , because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really does it do with me , let me believe that the Lyn@@ chen is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called the only police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks invites you to his table , he eats and reminds of the civil rights .
he said he already started to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the follow is inspiring , because it describes the horror of what we bear , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s like that , if we learn nothing , then it can happen again .
whoever does not study its own history , who does not know his own history is do@@ omed to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s mon@@ umental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf is a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous directed against gigantic , six @-@ story back@@ drop .
the revol@@ ving platform ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) is a fo@@ aming street corner with a wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pl@@ aste and &quot; logo from East Germany or New York Stock Exchange .
before , an open Mercedes classic car par@@ ked in which the Rhine @-@ le@@ thal is pos@@ ing as an Rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or an alternative to Is@@ etta .
conf@@ isc@@ ated oil drums recall Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and gre@@ ed - which moves through his &quot; Ring &quot; cap@@ turing .
the three Rhine sl@@ abs - sung by Stephanie H@@ out@@ ze@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra Steiner - as well as in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; mar@@ vel@@ ous .
they will bring the Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , and in Hollywood @-@ Mani@@ er a cor@@ pse in the trunk and enter the Rap@@ allo @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the glorious Hagen , which surro@@ unds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight bo@@ xer .
brutal the scene when he strikes Siegfried .
later on , Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) still has to believe .
the audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause .
Foster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who beha@@ ved himself modest and dist@@ ressed the hands of Merkel rob@@ ber@@ y .
great applause is available for the Fest@@ spiel@@ orchester , which shows for the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in le@@ aner leisure clothing .
the appearance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ et@@ eam had been eag@@ erly a@@ waited .
in 2013 , he still had to leave the pipe organ concert for himself , five years later , there was five years later , in which the single &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to be happy about this .
&quot; we noted that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she had just said before the performance of the d@@ pa .
the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of its view .
I will draw a positive res@@ ume .
max amount works as volunteers
they work at several locations in their volunteer year .
where to everywhere ?
quantity : usually in Stein@@ furt in the furniture exchange , once in the week I help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I already worked in the open all day on the school .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum I see here .
I have to do with different people , with juven@@ iles , with refugees , with young adults .
they are 26 years now , so a late @-@ job volunteers .
how does this come ?
quantity : I have made SL@@ C .
and then a civil engineering study , we say , successfully .
I know for me , that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else , working with people .
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
just a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point perhaps , really is .
and was it like that ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , a social worker training and study in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule .
is it not unusual while volunteers have several different applications ?
quantity : yes , it &apos;s very variable .
it depends on where to make his FS@@ J .
you can do it from ancient home to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was also partly in the O@@ gs , so in the afternoon care .
for me this was exactly the right thing that has irrit@@ ated me .
I could recognize and see my own strengths and see how it is really running .
unlike in civil engineering studies ?
quantity : sure , here it is not about to calculate st@@ atics .
you always have other people in front of my head , which each have a very different story behind .
whether a refugee , whether a youth , who has been picked out of the family - you must always go down individually .
very interesting .
and they did not have any touch of contact ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy .
there is an area that gives a lot .
a lot of love , much kindness .
there are also negative moments , but so life itself .
Pear@@ son hi@@ ves more 3,000 jobs and cut the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education Group Pear@@ son said on Friday , it will be able to disman@@ tle more than 3,000 jobs and its intermediate dividend by 72 percent , since another restructuring program will be started to overcome the pressure with which the company is confron@@ ted .

EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns Dec@@ ision to Del@@ aying the Smo@@ g rule to Kl@@ agen
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay a regulation of government by Obama , under which the states are obliged to inf@@ use Smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this was a day after 15 States accused the agency because of the stri@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced its decision on Wednesday the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone regulations 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said , they show the obligation of the agency to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and remember that we react to our state partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA leader Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the int@@ ent of the EPA , the o@@ zone rules - in which part of the country must be measured in a part of the country &apos;s pollut@@ ant emissions , to maintain ri@@ gor@@ ous air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the Colombia district , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to imp@@ ose a wide range of environmental impact on the former president Barack Obama , as part of a wider agenda , which is meant to stimul@@ ate economic growth .
however , efforts have caused the set@@ back of the Democrats and conservation groups that worry about the effects of greater emissions to public health .
the EPA website says that the inhal@@ ation of air , which contains o@@ zone , contains &quot; the lung function , and strengthen respiratory symptoms , &quot; such as asthma .
Municipal Council wants to be common room
in the end , the decision was clear : in two counter@@ voices the church of Flu@@ orn win@@ ches decides to set up the establishment of a common room in the future senior housing complex .
in front of the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still lack of land was signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden reports .
although it still will take , until the church in the church is owned , there is no planning to create a private investor from a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - around 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters area for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the church is pending , such a common room not as a meeting point only for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ able living room , but open in the community .
for example , the word from &quot; kn@@ ack café &quot; made a round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision adopted by the provision of funds for the current budget is already pre @-@ determined in the last autumn , by funding possibilities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is in the renovation area .
the establishment of a common room would be , as reported as T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 per cent of 30 percent .
the decision to be sign@@ alled to sign@@ alize the investor that you do not want to put ni@@ p@@ ples between the legs , which is le@@ aning on it - as well as at P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - which reduces the tr@@ insi@@ c level and make the construction economical - possible .
need@@ less , not only Wil@@ fried sole , be this promise .
when it helps : unanim@@ ously , it happens to the panel .
it is not as simple as the common room .
Daniela &apos;s reputation has been pointing to the many of his own buildings with which you are not going to be so much ahead of the common room for the window , she says : &quot; I am doing so difficult for it . &quot;
Y@@ vonne Sta@@ iger speaks for the common room , but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it sees behind it a conce@@ aled sub@@ sid@@ y of land@@ fills or even foreign investors .
that is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface there is no supplement , but will be a real , in doubt , in doubt , is the counter@@ speech .
Sta@@ en@@ ers request , apply for resolution according to the resolution , takes hold of three supporters .
so , in two counter@@ voices at the original program , Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ ises this : &quot; if we set up the decision , we make a huge jump , a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;

hiking in the resin from Stern
in Har@@ z the national first &quot; star path &quot; was created .
this is the association observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star path &quot; come to the needs of many har@@ bours , it was named .
it combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance .
the members want to set up the planned route along the planned route and inform them about stars and stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the first phase of 2018 the club plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ reaching installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
interview with St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Brown , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on boards should be supple@@ mented via the Internet .
this is why we play a good mobile network reception at the site selection .
accessibility is also a crit@@ eri@@ on .
later the star@@ base train is to be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the viewer experienced much knowledge worth knowing about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they met why stars would have different colors or why a star more brigh@@ tened than another , although it is much further away .
also , in which constellation is a selected star , and when he &apos;s best to see .
the association has already been running in the town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest located observ@@ atory in Northern Germany since 2014 .
the location in the middle of the National Park Har@@ z counts according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation to the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there they originate from the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy with naked eye .
since 2003 , there has been something similar to the Association of Planet@@ arium Göttingen in the university since 2003 , something similar to the planned constellation - the planet@@ arium .
starting with Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet@@ arium will lead up to Hain@@ berg and Stern@@ warte - as well as a &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the plugs with the individual planets - including des to the d@@ warf plan@@ ed Plu@@ to at the end point - are precisely positioned in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks so on a sphere of 6.5 mm diameter , while the sun measures exactly 70 meters away .
the entire distance of the planet is over four kilometres .
while the sun is needed up to about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour to get to the plugs with Plu@@ to .
pede@@ stri@@ ans are faster than light in the cos@@ mos .
the march to the next fi@@ xation would last still a half year .

&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; remembered Garcia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I went up for bronze &#91; on 140 lbs &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;

four injuries to the ty@@ re plat@@ ter
during an accident on the A7 , four persons were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information the driver was lost from an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira at 16.@@ 30 pm shortly before the market launch site , probably after a tire plat@@ ter .
the car led to the right to the vill@@ ain , where he was over@@ taking , and then lying on the roof in the green@@ ery .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured during the accident .
during the initial operation of the injured service life , the A7 toward the north was locked to the north for about an hour , then traffic could be driven on the left @-@ road crossing at the accident location .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; turning chain works better &quot;
And@@ re Hoffmann hopes for the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener for the end of the season to make the optim@@ isation of the def@@ ensive formation .
with the first season of the season , And@@ re Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , there were not the two oppos@@ ites at the 2 : 2 towards Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two areas too much , and we have to fit even better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ ensive @-@ player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge the thresh@@ ing chain should be optimized .
and a fool after a fre@@ aking , the people no longer want to catch up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be so that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) will be on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is able to improve the experience in preparation with the thresh@@ ing chain than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we are going to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his Trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is his thing for sure , &quot; because we just have to build on the half@@ way on the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ ieß@@ el@@ mann players who can build them well , &quot; Hoffmann said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre@@ mise is , but that we are even better harmon@@ ious and we don &apos;t afford to afford such a lot of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one cannot speak after a failed start , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could definitely be okay , &quot; Hoffmann said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we stand on Sunday with four points and we can concentrate on the trop@@ hy , we will certainly speak of a regular season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his coach wanted nothing to know about it .
&quot; the start into the season I was only after six to eight playing days , &quot; Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to speak of an advantage over to Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony had to be cancelled due to an adverse weather .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can make the season almost with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believes that players from Au@@ e could even be something more fresh , as they could not have a heavy and full game like Fort@@ una versus a favorite favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know about 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the interior of the Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although guests from the Rhin@@ eland go to the Rhin@@ eland as a little favorite on Sunday to the meeting ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we may throw them away , just because we have the claim to come under the first six , is rub@@ b@@ ish , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no crew in the 2nd Bundesliga , which one has to beat from the outs@@ et , &quot; explains Fort@@ unas chef coach .
&quot; such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el will not experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ age applications published
the latest results of testing for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have under@@ gone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes on the accuracy of this results .
the Swedish authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Er@@ en@@ cephal@@ opo@@ ei@@ a ) has started the test of tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , they are supposed to be more precise in the asylum procedure , after the Swedish migration authority ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for lack of age against several refugees that were min@@ ed .
from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older , while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency told that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person may &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; possibly be under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are carried out only in cases where the person &apos;s age is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , results are permanent during the past months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no large difference in the statistics of the last months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases where the person was judged over the age of 18 , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers weighed about his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; propose that the under@@ estimated person is 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bl@@ a@@ det submitted the 5@@ 81 results published , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said it was 18 years old .
the method of medical age assessment , which are made for X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images , which are analysed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas .
a scep@@ tic ist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of biological maturity of people , to see whether they were sooner or later than usually by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I do not think the type of measurement should be used .
to assess the biological age in this way , is very uncertain .
if we cannot say it sure we should not do as if we could it , &quot; he said the newspaper metro .
Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of being an adult is not quite righ@@ t@@ ful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the largest risk is in this case , if the person is under 18 , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in the Plan
working on the three bridges of the district Road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ra@@ mberg are doing well .
on Wednesday seven tons of concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Construction Manager at the Department of Road Construction and Transport in the Regier@@ ungsp@@ rä@@ si@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
work simultaneously began on all three refurb@@ ishing bridges between Sch@@ ra@@ mberg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the construction is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the timet@@ able is kept .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ra@@ mberg , leads across the tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge from concrete , which is lined with a red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure the stability and road safety , the three buildings are thoroughly renovated .
the other two bridges guide the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning on Wednesday morning a 1.@@ 30 meters wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge f@@ lap .
this is a boundary that is used as operating road .
the southern part of the bridge should be used on Friday a 2.@@ 20 meters wide bridge folder .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way shall fail .
the special thing is that it is about manufacturing parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented breasts arms .
specific finger@@ print feel the laying of lines required by the construction site in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a glass fibre cable attached to which many companies are connected .
the natives were informed on the advance of the work by hand@@ outs on the project .
furthermore fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be rep@@ lic@@ ated .
for the bridges between the building farm and the collecting centre towards Sch@@ ra@@ mberg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
for the construction of the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher Park , the street is fully locked in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den . &quot;
the cost of the three frac@@ tures amount to 700 000 Euro .
financed by the whole country .
AF@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under protest at German potato salad
it does not come so frequently that parties are going to move on a strand , but if it comes to the alternative for Germany ( AF@@ D ) , comes together , what else is difficult for a hat .
the Parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows this day peaceful flag because AF@@ D invites the AF@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle R@@ ond@@ ell as a loud poster &quot; big election campaign . &quot;
and known names to the start , like Alice Wei@@ del , which together with Alexander Gau@@ land is the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the Deputy President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k .
but those who already are in front of the event at the beginning of the event , do not want to listen to the AF@@ D @-@ developers , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel will remain colorful . &quot;
originally , the town pic@@ nic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now take place on the parking below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AF@@ D @-@ Event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colourful picture that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chairman of the Forum A World and one of the decisive organis@@ ers , are really happy : &quot; great how many people have come together here . &quot;
there is music and plenty of food , including a &quot; German potato salad , which could also eat the AF@@ D , &quot; says the woman who brought him .
the police ra@@ ves many officials after Ger@@ ol@@ stein , she shows presence in particular also at the railway station , which is just a few metres from the locations .
what did the AF@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported from the AF@@ D volcanoes , he endeav@@ oured to get such an event and get the surcharge .
the 45 year old from G@@ ön@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built @-@ built Lau@@ ren@@ ti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes are not available enough parking spaces .
so the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
overlooking the event , he says : &quot; that &apos;s the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
it also does , at about 20 o &apos;clock in the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ as square , a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle of several speakers , including the Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ alz AF@@ D @-@ Chair@@ s Uwe Boy .
there are about 200 listen@@ ers who are waiting that the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy President Beat@@ rix are holding their speeches .
unchanged , the police presence , but so far the civil servants had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour takes the AF@@ D event , guests at the front place have a longer breath , but also there is just after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can get off - no special inci@@ dents .

both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held sal@@ opo@@ si@@ tions in European class orchest@@ ras .
in the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli , Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ is is the SWR sym@@ ph@@ ony orchest@@ ras .

Johann Sebastian Bach on the two like in a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; World Music &quot; combines with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz musician N@@ ils W@@ ogram , mix classical music , jazz and free play to a fascinating overall art work .
this core of the program was first performed in Freiburg on this spring .

Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about her bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; some people love the cheese and they will eat it until the end of their lives .
but I want to try everything , &quot; as Kri@@ sten Stewart openly about her bis@@ ex@@ ual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I bite the cheese at once , I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
probably the most well @-@ known relationship of the Hollywood star was the &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert Patt@@ inson , who finally dealt bitter .
despite all , the b@@ rün@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin opposite the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was really serious in love that I had .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think about , I have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after their separation , Kri@@ sten gave that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I &apos;ve always lived and believed the du@@ alism .
so it has never been confused or ob@@ struc@@ ted me .
I never liked it , not seriously taken seriously . &quot;
particularly , it suffered from &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z , &quot; but at school time as they prefer : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven , I told me the children , I would look like a bu@@ b .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and humili@@ ated .
now I look back and remember : &apos; girls &apos; be proud of you ! &apos; .
especially the public would not love her love life : &quot; people expect you to be a certain way and anno@@ ys me .
and perhaps I call me some und@@ ank@@ able but I don &apos;t like to justify the public before the whole public . &quot;
West Virginia Governor of Virginia announces that he changes the party
the Democratic Governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night at a rally with President Tr@@ ump to change his party .
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Governor Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and many thought ... today I will tell you as a inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a coach I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a great announcement at West Virginia rally before .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice didn &apos;t endor@@ s@@ ate the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton .
Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
Forbes put that he has coal mines in five states , and inherited a coal business from his father .
he is worth $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime the Republican National Committee announced on Thursday evening a declaration which said : &quot; the Party change by Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party which would rather have been working for us to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 Govern@@ ments and the control of the f@@ ew@@ est bodies in history , the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last re@@ jection of a party that is from top to bottom without guidance and is not able to find a positive , reason@@ ably able message , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ chair R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CO@@ E Pra@@ ise &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for oping sc@@ andal
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised the Thursday that he described as an evident excuse from Russia to a D@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he repeated , it is not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in the sport .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics leader Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the World Athle@@ tics World Championships that the association was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the d@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , those in competitions gold and silver medals were shot away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in spite of his comments , the IA@@ AF congress voted for maintaining the ban , which was imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) report to state sponsored d@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole Council and the entire Congress pleased that Russian Federation has realized in itself , that they have experienced quite some hot times , and everything possible to make sure the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; CO@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia would accept the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very construc@@ tive day , and I think that progress were achieved , but the Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; Co@@ e said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the principle of principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athl@@ ets from the un@@ cor@@ ted system , &quot; he added
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will begin with the Athle@@ tics World Championships , which begin on Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as a neutral player .
the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ setting .
drug tests are still in@@ sufficient and prohibited train@@ ers are still free , he said rep@@ orters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
funeral p@@ act for imprisoned soldiers for in Mali
at a funeral in the nor@@ theastern Frit@@ z@@ lar , approximately 1,000 people of the two have thought of a helicopter desc@@ ending in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high safety precau@@ tions .
for still un@@ explained ab@@ dic@@ ation , Defense Minister Ursula von der Ley@@ en ( CD@@ U ) said nothing .
they described the two given pilots , but as &quot; C@@ ould of their experts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice , which they created in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old hand@@ le@@ w@@ ler from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week ago in West African Mali .
her sc@@ ary were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a dead station of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Sankt Peter .
at noon they only took leave of the relatives in the Church .
afterwards , the funeral in the circle of the family , eng@@ ster friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and Politics began .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the German Armed Forces Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
sad@@ ness laid down roses , the relatives filed an arm in his arm .
before the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ es and countless soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
the minister of defence from the Ley@@ en described the converted soldiers as &quot; high decorated &quot; and collap@@ sing .
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann has built the flight operations of the helicopter tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regim@@ ent .
Volker &apos;s gar@@ den@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regim@@ ent , said to which the soldiers belong , said : &quot; if this occupation was not able to waste the crash , it would not have been w@@ asted . &quot;
doubts at the UN Mission in Mali , Minister of Ley@@ es did not show : the use is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he was also of high meaning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country where we are separated from two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the rope were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr still made no information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife .
that shared the royal house on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de church .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for both of them .
the queen was understood with her husband &apos;s decision , it was the name of the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik was buried , is still un@@ clear .
he doesn &apos;t have the intention to join in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik never had a h@@ ehl out of it that he wasn &apos;t happy with his title .
after the Thr@@ ust of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would like to be king .
in 2016 he retired to reti@@ re , and he also puts the title &quot; Prince leis@@ urely . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and the function he wanted to see himself as equivalent to his wife - even not after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by declared the chief spokes@@ woman of the Danish Royal House .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years .
Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristoc@@ ra@@ tic , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
at the Th@@ ames he worked in the French Embassy .
during his later wife , Prince Hen@@ rik had always had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year anniversary with the Dan@@ e .
in an auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik expressed over the first years in Denmark : &quot; just a few months after my arrival , everything I did , was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was pregnant , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk scre@@ ams instead of kn@@ itting , Citroën took place instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked mine instead of Virginia tobacco and which had the call to be the brand of soci@@ o @-@ critical intellec@@ tu@@ als , I could not hope for consideration .
I was different .
I seemed happy to be satisfied with this position , and not to be ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were just two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Weil intends to do a f@@ lap new election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of the majority in Lower Saxony
the former prime minister of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , after the loss of red @-@ green government majority , is a rapid re @-@ election of the country , but he doesn &apos;t want to re@@ sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the Parliament &apos;s dis@@ solution was on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprise of a Green MPs from their country fra@@ ction in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a heavy crisis .
five months before the official re @-@ election date , the red @-@ green coalition lost its kno@@ cking one @-@ votes majority in Parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets founded its step with non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in its election circuit in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained in Hanover on Friday .
CD@@ U @-@ Leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ink@@ ler wants to recommend to his group to record them .
with that , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Sax@@ on Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far , the ratio was revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag is elected regular on the 14th January of the year .
Th@@ ick@@ ers said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether it could not gover@@ n in this situation without a majority .
Stephan Weil , however , holds it indispensable that the rural day decides to achieve its self @-@ resolution solution as soon as possible .
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide about its further information on Tuesday .
the state constitution also sees the possibility that the Prime Minister will take the trust of the Prime Minister and cho@@ oses his successor .
&quot; our constitution offers several options .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be subject to legally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ink@@ ler said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will discuss all questions when they are legally checked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fol@@ ks@@ ler named T@@ west@@ ens Step &quot; but something strange . &quot;
the Political himself stressed : &quot; I am no gu@@ ardian .
I feel very well . &quot;
they described himself as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens requested the sec@@ ret@@ ched par@@ liament@@ arians on the return of its Land@@ scape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we go off , of course , that she has received the green state list with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divided the state president Meta Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner , with immediate effect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leader of the Gre@@ ens on the Green An@@ ja PI@@ EL said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it deliberately has chosen to lead no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even before the background there was no obvious differences , we can &apos;t follow this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transition of the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ ester to the CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Gre@@ ens in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Bund@@ esch@@ ef of Socialists and Democrats on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to re @-@ elect the Land@@ tag quickly .
the outlet T@@ west@@ ens will cost the majority of red @-@ green in Lower Saxony .
the political interests in their humili@@ ation and in their fru@@ stration tell their personal interests in the interests of the country , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation .
&quot; it &apos;s a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty intri@@ gue game and tries to propose a political capital . &quot;
objective CD@@ U @-@ Leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ink@@ ler wants to recommend his M@@ EPs to record El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets into the CD@@ U .
the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw the v@@ ets with a personal career in favour of the 2013 country election .
at that time the CD@@ U was the strongest force , SPD and Green in the country but a hau@@ gh@@ ty majority of one voice .
agriculture minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from tox@@ ins , Mr Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses on contam@@ inated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal pass ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt , How can the consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers and consumers who watch eggs in your fridge and check the st@@ amping pressure .
on the Consumer Protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states represent the latest information on the affected eggs .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if according to everything we know currently , health haz@@ ard is practically excluded .
now Al@@ di is taking over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs get out of the offer - because the central role of recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
the food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has shut off immediately and is located since the announcement of Germany &apos;s affected exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
trade has the same way to contribute to the manufacturers that the sold @-@ selling products and health are un@@ think@@ able .
if the return of the return level of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not traffic .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time not the ag@@ rituris@@ mi to blame .
are production plants and consumers sit in the same boat ?
according to the key knowledge , production companies does not meet immediate guilt .
rather , they must reck@@ on it due to alleged illegal practices of service companies with economic damage .
as always , there is too little control in the harvest .
is it only missing on the staff or also at the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls which have exposed the operation .
however , the fact that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded .
therefore , a consistent adv@@ ent of such events and hand@@ over to the citizens in the cases where stra@@ in@@ ates may be pre@@ defined , of crucial importance .
I have already made several times clearly , that I expect from the responsible authorities .
is the regular mu@@ d@@ m really necessary for food scales ?
consumer consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and convenient food .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ tici@@ de is used in the food industry , consumers are entitled to consumers .
manufacturer , dealers and consumer are advised to get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ tici@@ des fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ sup@@ plying animals is not h@@ ic@@ able and must be stopped immediately .
it must be consistent on all levels and worked with high @-@ pressure .
I expect from all relevant authorities , that the atomic fact is clari@@ fied .
how the financial rules of the football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ iting issues of European football matches , N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record @-@ transfer from Spanish Barcelona will not distur@@ b the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
some consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEFA , as the leading organization that monitors the European game has power , teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules , which were launched in 2011 by UEFA Cup , mean that PS@@ G would like to show that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without great losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) in order to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to tens of ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G is able to loose the money with safety , so that N@@ ey@@ mar writes and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , in view of the financing of the team through the energy @-@ rich ruler of Qatar .
if you are allowed to apply a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but must reci@@ proc@@ ate the Bre@@ ak @-@ Even point in her on the soccer @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007 .
former French players believed that clubs in their quest had taken enormous debt on their quest , effectively frau@@ dul@@ ent and ris@@ ked to recru@@ it when banks or owners moved their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P moved from concentration to the debt of their losses on the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Abra@@ mo@@ vich was originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then strong invested in order to improve the team and to build a global brand - to be tough@@ er matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses in the amount of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini is fallen by the Presi@@ dency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEFA successor is Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in to continue to gr@@ as@@ shop@@ per from excessive expendi@@ tures .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will increase the rules for the future , &quot; Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEFA for FF@@ P , compared with The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week .
although the PS@@ G paid the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of his contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the ability to be issued for the next five years , amounting to 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has joined the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G was granted a fine of € 60 million ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to € 20 million - and it was ordered that the European Championship for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 will be held on 21 players , otherwise the normal 25 players remain limited .
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to super@@ list their financial supervision by bringing out their income by businesses that are linked to the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could have the PS@@ G transp@@ onder@@ s if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the default market rates , the UEFA would not apply as legitimate income .
exactly that happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the amount of sponsor@@ ing of PSA was pu@@ ffed from Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar will come across all of the organis@@ ational committees of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have cont@@ ested that N@@ ey@@ mar WM am@@ bass@@ adors will be easy to find out a such maneu@@ ver for the UEFA Cup regulatory authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEFA will still be more attentive to notice the rules .
the UEFA had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G over N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they said under the condition of An@@ ony@@ m@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not fu@@ cked to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest reports revealed that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with sales of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year must be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrive a blessing for Sponsor@@ ing De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot sales .
the association insi@@ sts that sales after the signing of at least 30 per cent is rising .
the Spanish league was clearly irrit@@ ated , one of the best football players go to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s away by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear fall of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial d@@ oping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar last owner on PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arsenal Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state that financed an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owner and it has changed the whole landscape of the ball in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the financial play FA@@ IR@@ PLA@@ Y because one can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new g@@ og@@ gi@@ ants
in recent years , choc@@ ol@@ at Fre@@ y has been prepared for Swiss Life .
now the sweet collaboration is in front of a possible end : the airline writes the order recently .

industry insi@@ sts estimate the order volume according to &quot; Northwest Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : for a g@@ og@@ gi@@ ate manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
as many applicants in the new announcement , Swiss will not want to betra@@ y Swiss .
in question , however , only Swiss manufacturers are coming .
according to the newspaper report , Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort by the contract over the spring of 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer could not be att@@ ain@@ able for a position .
choc@@ ol@@ ates boards distributed to Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before Swiss signed a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has delivered to co @-@ operation with Hu@@ g the chocolate @-@ tablets .
the opportunity to place the logo , Swiss conducted a two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
the customers of First Class with tasty treats will be spo@@ iled by Con@@ fis@@ erie Sp@@ rün@@ gli , in the business class n@@ aschen Pass@@ og@@ gi of Lind@@ t and Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y .

blow against drugs @-@ Mafia in the country
the police is a blow against the Italian m@@ af@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Con@@ stance , Esslingen and Stuttgart were searched for numerous objects , such as the public prosecutor &apos;s office .
at the age of 25 , 15 was arrested in the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued un@@ sealed arrest war@@ rants .
in addition , the officers put greater amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , as well as several hundred thousand Euros .
at the same raid in Italy two persons were arrested .
there were German arrest war@@ rants against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans .
they are thought to be extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
all in all , more than 300 polic@@ emen were employed .
members of the Mafia is called drug criminal , severe violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
already since summer 2016 the public prosecutor &apos;s office was determined by the organised drug trade in the south @-@ German room .
between the citizens of the Con@@ stance and Palermo , an open exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
thus the large use on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; into the visor of the investigations were especially Italian citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related to Italian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ af@@ ia &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , at the early morning several shots were fired at a restaurant &apos;s home , should go to the gang of bonds .
how great g@@ aps lie in the fore@@ ig@@ ner @-@ Register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data of citizens who should not emerge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : a report indicating the fore@@ ig@@ ner @-@ register in Germany show considerable short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this lead to partially serious mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures .
the Federal Government for Refu@@ gee Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , according to a media report , according to large g@@ aps in a country @-@ cent@@ ric register .
short@@ com@@ ings of the registered data could lead to some serious mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures , in an analysis called the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; in an analysis called the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
according to the regi@@ sters , ten million people are reported by foreign nationality , including about 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
according to data , data will therefore be administered by some 600 foreigners in Germany .
because the data was not sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts so far has not been good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of people who are long no longer in life , or of citizens who have become German citizens and not to emerge in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; f@@ law@@ ed data input can significantly slow@@ down considerably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics on und@@ ep@@ tive people are covered by EU citizens , who would not have to travel out .
such false states , however , led to a dist@@ orted debate on dealing with trav@@ ellers &quot; means , therefore , in the analysis .
meanwhile , the federal government has obviously started to re @-@ send refugee families with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they arrived from there .
this is out of an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) reported the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück Zeitung &quot; reports .
in the paper it says that B@@ AM@@ F perform this method &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , it was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation is on site .
after the Dublin agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees to reach the EU .
if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send him back to the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the reason the ministry is now : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the entrance capacity for families with under@@ age children have increased substantially in Italy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy has delivered for the recording and accommodation of families guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) consider these comm@@ itments to be sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back to the Dublin @-@ Agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the internal political spokesperson on the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children are threatening for lack of conditions in the Italian asylum system of human rights conditions and a child of child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood from Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach living persons was already available for other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who were awarded the Friday .
at all , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now distributed over 50 litres of blood with his meanwhile 100 funds .
traditionally , the church is traditionally t@@ ailed in the session of the Common Council the multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is brilliant , as our body is created for it and we will provide donations that their blood are available for foreigners , nor yet un@@ profitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; headed by the German Red Cross ( DR@@ s ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the preserved foods are crushed into their components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , three persons could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported the actions taken out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved 114 donations for the second best result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K group leader . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the change to the theater play a few years ago at higher number of participants .

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have affected the spec@@ ulation over a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will remain as they maintain interest rates on family income in the middle of a intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s political decision @-@ makers ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 , to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with this month less members agreed a rise , as the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in its quarterly annual rate of inflation , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 on 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on the budget would continue , whereas inflation is expected to rise to nearly 3 % in autumn .
but it signals that in the next years Z@@ ambi@@ tions would be necessary to breed the inflation of the Bre@@ xit , and she said that the loan costs may be more than expected to rise to financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw a part of the Mamm@@ ut Recovery package which was published a year after a Bre@@ xit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will demand time to provide funding for banks in order to provide funding from the upcoming February , although it is expected that they will be able to provide 15 billion pounds more in the context of this system - with 115 billion pounds Sterling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , as pressure on the real wages of households continue to reduce consumption . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the interest rate , it repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slightly larger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be required than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets currently forecast the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another year 2020 .
the Bank , however , stressed that increases &quot; gradually &quot; and &quot; limits . &quot;
the Bank revised down@@ ward growth forecasts for this and next year are 1.9 % , and 1.7 % in May .
she maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pounds fell after this news from the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the latest dis@@ appo@@ inting growth figures have passed the rising expectations on a rate of interest and the GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % has risen to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to fall at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is slightly rec@@ u@@ per@@ ated after the Bank at the end of the year .
the latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by an increasing inflation and low @-@ level rise , since the mer@@ ging is even worse before it becomes better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy in the next years could not be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages for the end of their triple dis@@ may recover &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clearly &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak Po@@ und , which will compens@@ ate for part of the lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes a year after lowering the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the fun@@ ct .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will complete the prices and the economy .
prior to the final decision of the Bank on interest rates , the reputation has increased after an interest rate , because inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ displacement households , with three political decision @-@ makers requested an increase to 0.5 % in July .
inflation has dropped from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank predicted that this was expected to re @-@ assist them in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that it is entitled to a 2 % ratio , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to write very &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ ca@@ is , director of Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ gage bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent return of s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive , as the len@@ ders are looking for businesses looking for businesses and want to finish this year in a positive manner .
the market looks great for those in which the existing De@@ als run and the new mort@@ g@@ ages include , and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) aims to discrimin@@ ate HIV @-@ drug in 10,000 people
patients will receive access to a &quot; trans@@ mitting &quot; HIV preventive treatment after a pre @-@ war campaign against funding of the drug in N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that there was a pre@@ ference of inf@@ lic@@ ated relief rop@@ hy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) which can reduce the risk of infection with high risk @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , now available for a first three year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he was willing to finance the trial after the Court of Appe@@ al confirmed a verdict of the Supreme Court in the last year , according to which the N@@ HS had the power to pay for the Pre@@ EP , despite the claim that local authorities should finance him .
the Chess train was announced on Thursday announced by N@@ HS England boss Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) described this as the &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be to the First who will follow the registration of people , and further clinics will be introduced in October , before it will be launched in whole England in April 2018 .
pre@@ ex@@ position rop@@ hy@@ la@@ xe ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ inters significantly reduced the HIV @-@ transmission with infection risk .
Pre@@ EP prior to sexual intercourse means that just enough medication is present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who come to the treatment in question , gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , tran@@ ss@@ ex@@ ual and persons with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people who live in England and registered with a resident doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the delivery of drugs in this week after an international competitive pro@@ curement .
the study aims to assess the entire potential of Pr@@ inters , where clinical evidence will be collected , used and implemented in a large scale .
Stev@@ ens said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement the vast and increasingly successful efforts to refu@@ ges HIV and over@@ take HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of sustained progress when maintaining one of the greatest health challenges of mankind . &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive for NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ EP , when targeted and vulnerable people is aimed at changing the English HIV epidemic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from September to people with high HIV @-@ risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded trial in England , to develop a new instrument , which is truly controlled , not subject to a negoti@@ ating with a partner , leading to improving many , many lives .
we welcome you all the announcement . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be revealed that the study is quickly carried out across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pre@@ EP @-@ Test &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sharon Hodg@@ son , shadow health minister , said : &quot; the start of the Pre@@ EP process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ating implementation .
the evidence shows how transformed this drug may be as part of our approach to HIV @-@ Prevention and finish the transfer of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV infected , and that it will contribute to ending the spread of HIV in society a step closer . &quot;
living life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court house into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former banana with a passion for real estate , shr@@ inks in 2014 by a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold their bags .
&quot; before that I lived in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; I searched for something that was comparable to my prize .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made a offer that day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a v@@ aul@@ ted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to use Jo@@ anne dam and a mezzanine to make the spacious deck height optimal .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development , but also a place for Jo@@ anne &apos;s life .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms to each other , so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think creative thinking to solve the submission .
&quot; the steel plant is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the spaces so that they were st@@ acked against each other , without having to b@@ ade ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not just about to build a simple platform , but to put it in steel that it had the correct height at the top or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with much additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us leads across the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
enclosed gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ lin lighting put the style for the program .
the use of spi@@ der plays a role when adding theatre , space and light .
in both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to work it longer .
in the kitchen , spi@@ ration feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mir@@ ro@@ red units can accommodate all the dum@@ plings and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous prey , the beauty of the living room can exclu@@ de the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a little engineering of engineering went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel reinforced , frigh@@ tened MDF door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important , so that when you push the door , it is very easy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the smart use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne gains additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or as your property is estimated , &quot; Er@@ fan says .
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate mak@@ ler is entering and perform a calculation based on the floor @-@ size . &quot;
here , they managed to enlarge the floor space and use high @-@ quality materials , which give the space its luxurious benefit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional connection in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ fan says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love you in electrical outlets in the walls .
these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased square meter of something inher@@ ent in something very aston@@ ishing .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this not .
brothers fighting for a 500 million US dollars of real estate
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a meditation on one of the biggest real estate of Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developers Colin De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and their business should be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers 38 properties valued at more than half a billion dollars , collected since the family purchased a shop in the Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood since 1973 .
the West family founded the West@@ co jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now comprises offices in the town centre , the development areas of Bruns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast , and Mt Bul@@ ler , and shopping centers in the subur@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after an agreement with her late father , Colin was described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the business of business and Paul about one @-@ third . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a Court of jurisdiction proves that Colin belonged to the value of $ 316 million and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the convic@@ tions of Colin proposed him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several failed negoti@@ ation , the Supreme Court of Justice took place last Friday .
the brothers also strug@@ gling to control over the existing business , including Colin , as Paul claims to have been excluded .
Colin argued that this is not true , but throws Paul in front of managing some owners .
in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that was filed by Colin , he says he wants to join the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost increases in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides held Bar @-@ Bar .
Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her husband &apos;s husband &apos;s husband Luigi were Italian immigrants that run dairy bars and delic@@ acy shops from the late 1950 &apos;s and in the early 1970s a shop in Bruns@@ wick .
they used the security to buy Coll@@ ing@@ wood properties in which Colin opened the first Je@@ ans@@ wood property .
Colin says he started West West when he was &quot; in High School &quot; when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) .
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property to her sons .
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to land the brothers in court , &quot; she wrote .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis group , but Colin claims that Mark were paid for the company &apos;s 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke as well as Mark , Paul says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colin did keep himself back , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and went to a biography from the year 2015 by Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s best friend of TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media participated with Colin and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
only Colin responded by SMS to say &quot; I can &apos;t say much , &quot; because the case is before the courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me , and to draw our family name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father didn &apos;t want Paul and I would end in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said and added that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope to have a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our concern will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Colin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps has plans to limit new chief of Staff to limit the media Ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others tried and have failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece of reporter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met his first day of working with leading employees , he introduced a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House , which he wants to repair : poor information that will fall into the hands of the president .
Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letters - because President would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys Diag@@ nosis makes sense , but others have tried to count tr@@ ump by monitor his meditation .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps relationship to television is enough for decades - and now , where he is at the White House , his television advertisement is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was anno@@ yed because of an un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against POL@@ IT@@ ICO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter hab@@ it under control , according to six former election campaign officials , to ensure that his personal media consumption has a constant praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps has ever been &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials know something we do not know - that Tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets would contain any more ignition .
we &apos;ll probably never learn anything about twe@@ ets , the tr@@ ump not sent .
when his associates gave it a few times , trouble away from him , then their efforts have been worthwhile .
but no one has consistently able to prevent dr@@ ump controversy .
a part of the problem exists , that people in a White House , which are competing with competing parties , will always try to present their own agenda by promoting tr@@ ump material which may potentially have their views from the world .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the pre@@ ference of consultants , president of strategic reasons desper@@ ate information .
this was an example , described by reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former tr@@ ump @-@ civil servants say that Tr@@ ump may react to negative press sections , especially those with humili@@ ating le@@ aks and that he can find out how these originate from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly that happened at the end of February , when someone accused a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the internet pro@@ voc@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy Chief of Staff of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a cluster of L@@ ecks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson had been ban@@ ished to Twitter permanently from Twitter or that he has no specific evidence , or that he expressed false alleg@@ ations in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke them .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to question people on Wal@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ maker added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system to manage the paper kra@@ m and document the tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did this work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove to prove more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still in influence .
these un@@ changeable factors make the Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
chis@@ eling criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the assistance of the population will pray and hoped .
the police in all over Europe will send postcards to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) postcards on the run .
since the addresses of the requested heavy criminals can not be known , indications from the population are hoping to pray and pray .
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the promotion , which follows the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; -@@ Adv@@ ent calendar of the winter .
the experiences would have shown that there were many volatile holiday destinations , it was named by Euro@@ pol .
we have compiled 21 postcards for selected criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ er@@ e@@ wanted has been viewed , more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed .
36 of the online searched could have been arrested , at least eleven of it based on the publication based on the website .
trav@@ ellers negoti@@ ate over a tren@@ ch and return back to the &apos; Million@@ är@@ s series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est house owners of West Mid@@ lands are back with some determined trav@@ ellers on the foot of war , which tra@@ ded one of the municipality drawn tren@@ ches to reverse a field in front of their men@@ op@@ ies .
the travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans on a field outside a weal@@ thy street of Soli@@ hull , called the &quot; Million@@ är@@ s series . &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transport brought before they were first published in May , but without being deported from the Council to prevent their sei@@ zu@@ res .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defence facilities and pushed their vehicles through a passage that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
ra@@ ging inhabitants have overcome the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said that it was &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; you went there on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley Heath where they were thrown onto the pass@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced to act in action because he was us@@ eless while dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
trav@@ ellers in May there were moved further , and we are back again .
more came last night , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to do it by taking a long teaching in order to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I bet on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue my common future if the Council can &apos;t stop it once . &quot;
a resident who didn &apos;t want to be called , said , &quot; It &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we just have seen the last round of this trav@@ eler only to be rai@@ ded by another round .
the numbers have increased this time and one even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot;
a speaker of Soli@@ hull committee said : &quot; we are aware of a fu@@ cking camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so that they continue as fast as possible .
to support our we@@ aving collection , it is very important that as many people report an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court has to try when we present our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the former ambi@@ ence operating company mbH back to 13 April 2014 , some 30 000 nights have been lost per year and also revenues by the local tax .
in the fall of 2014 , faced with dramatically rising numbers of refugees who arrived in the county , the hotel buildings were offered as a gathering camp , what sort of controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by adding a development plan to secure the territory as a hotel location .
the decision was not disputed at that time at the time .
but , above all , Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Upper Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the property site , and already talked to the house at that time .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star @-@ plus category under the name of Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Hu@@ al@@ b .
you are called Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof there have been a long time building container in front of the entrance , and when you ride the house , it becomes clear how extensive renovation works are made .
the floors were torn out , ceilings to a part , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is much to do until März .
&quot; it &apos;s a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large guarded showers , the input field is designed , there are new windows installed .
everything should be &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses himself .
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment .
it would not be positioned at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a higher downtown level , Sch@@ erer empha@@ sizes .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its about 60 rooms should be spread wide and more explained .
both holi@@ day@@ makers , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Krau@@ se he already led , so Sch@@ erer .
the shows of the city are surrounded with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the high level of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer will not want to define exactly .
under a million euro , he expects .
exterior facilities are also brought on front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace which is open from the restaurant that is open to public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : American Special En@@ ters wins Grand Jury
in the Russia affair of US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special exec@@ ution@@ ers Robert Mu@@ eller should have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the panel recorded the work in recent weeks , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote under calling on the job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the newspaper endor@@ sed the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
the station CNN reported that there is already the first pre@@ lad@@ ders of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s oldest son and a Russian attor@@ ney .
U.S. intelligence agencies acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin to have targeted targeted in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller explo@@ res if there were differences between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigations , several men are supposed to be ag@@ grav@@ ated in the election campaign as a consultant of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more dr@@ y@@ ps private and business environment under the micro@@ scope .
a couple of weeks ago , the Washington Post wrote a couple of weeks ago , that the Special R@@ ump is personally put into the centre and under@@ go the accus@@ ation whether the President in the course of the affair may have imp@@ lied the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
the main task of Grand jur@@ ors is to examine and decide evidence of whether accus@@ ation shall be raised .
Grand jur@@ ors are therefore called the accus@@ ation chambers .
mostly they are switched on , if it is a major and controversial case .
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
the panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to charge people under oath by hearing .
according to the broad@@ caster CNN , pre @-@ charging have already been issued to turn the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian attor@@ ney .
persons who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement , it was named in the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
beside Tr@@ ump J@@ r. there were also Tr@@ um@@ ps Consult@@ ant and swi@@ m@@ son J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his dam@@ aging election campaign Paul Man@@ a@@ fort with the conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the creation show that Mu@@ eller would not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that it should be necessary to act fast .
however , it must not be called , however , that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the charges of an indictment .
nevertheless , the establishment of the Gre@@ mi@@ um is the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason to concern President Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the new revel@@ ations used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to depic@@ t the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Russia history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
the subject give the Democrats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else , about which they can talk . &quot;
his special adviser T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a position he knows nothing about the composition of a Grand Jury .
this , however , usually work in secret issues , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House fears any measures that accelerated the work of the special team at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; f@@ aire &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey had said three times that not against the president I was determined .
I have no reason to assume that something changed in it , it was stated in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller was first used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this ra@@ ging , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump were noisy , he would have to hin@@ der judi@@ ci@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ey said in June ahead of a Senate committee , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump asked him for a setting of investigations against the then national security adviser to Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president is under enormous pressure because of the investigation .
after a presentation of U.S. media , the White House collected material against the special medi@@ ator and its employees .
that dis@@ band@@ ed spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller is released .
unlike an independent special medi@@ ator of the Congress , like in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , around the after@@ ward pre@@ sidents Richard Nixon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could be fired from the President of the Ministry of Justice in theory .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republican and democratic sen@@ ators were submitted to the draft law , after which the special mitt@@ ees could no longer be released .
Antar@@ ctic : gigantic ice mountain drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the West@@ ant@@ ark@@ tis , a gigantic ice@@ berg has been solved by the barely seven fold @-@ fold size of Berlin .
this divided the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener @-@ Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the over a B@@ illion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres large Kol@@ oss are now to the north and will probably take two , three years until it was melted .
it is 175 kilometres long and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest king@@ makers who have registered in the past three decades .
there is no danger to man from him .
although climate change has played a role in the crash of the ice@@ berg , research data is un@@ clear .
in total , however , for around 30 years there has been a series of unusual quar@@ ries in the region , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a fact @-@ background .
after the opinion of many researchers , it can be related to global warming .
the ch@@ atter Kol@@ oss now has been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ lei@@ s Lar@@ sen .
Sch@@ el@@ lei@@ s swi@@ ms on the sea , and is fed by great gl@@ aciers .
thus it grows further into the sea and breaks up regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ strom is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
north of this Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ ises , the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ ort was disturbed some years ago .
a complete ch@@ aff may be sm@@ iled there , writes A@@ WI @-@ Research and Daniela Jan@@ sen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ lei@@ s are in danger , because the front edge has never been withdrawn as far as at present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the iron plate stand under tension and can be broken down , if at a key station a piece break down .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ lei@@ s and Eis@@ berg increases the sea level not because they swim on the water and melt the ice as much water as it comes after the melting itself .
however , the loss of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ ises leads to the gl@@ aciers flow directly into the sea as well as much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in small measurements , writes the British research project to the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ der@@ mal is the fourth largest city of Antar@@ c@@ tica following an area of almost 50 000 square kilometres .
on the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 metres .
there it breaks up regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural happening and un@@ consciously , the ice sign is in a dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is the most extensive retreat since the beginning of Records , &quot; he also confirmed .
among scientists would be cont@@ ested whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ker will come back again or not meet the long @-@ term , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models tell that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if this researcher did not return the departure of this gigantic ice ice@@ berg to change climate change , so in the past few decades , however , many king@@ doms of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula are broken .
this long skir@@ t of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends in the direction of South America .
according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice area of Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the decline has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have war@@ med around three degrees in the past 50 years and counting the areas where the temperature is fastest .
CD@@ U wants to support Hau@@ st@@ arif on the staff
because it is increasingly difficult to occupy free positions , the CD@@ U calls to join the employer association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break the delivery day 41 new jobs in the administration has penet@@ rated .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the circular management in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 tra@@ inees have their first working day behind .
the teachers in the circle are obviously very desired .
about 620 applicants were to be recorded during this year .
nevertheless , the circle is still missing staff to master the increased requirements and tasks .
at present , there are M@@ ett@@ mann circle according to as 50 non @-@ occupied places .
among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration , are sought .
the CD@@ U wants to join the initiative together with the F@@ DP and U@@ WG &apos;s initiative and escaped the skilled worker in the administration .
after the desire of the parties , the administration should work &quot; a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development . &quot;
the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term requirements on the forces , but to future @-@ orient@@ ated applicants , says it .
the overall concept should look inside and extern@@ ally orient@@ ate specific measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and include an apprentic@@ eship offensive , call CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this is already listening to a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems , which one didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adver@@ tise good officials and employees and provide more attractive terms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is from a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , a high number of employees , disease or age caused by the ministry is coming out .
so the highest time to act , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , president of the CD@@ U , goes out with his party even beyond the joint request .
he had long ago already in the cra@@ yon for a big surprise , when he asked the number of personnel on the public and the other parties were start@@ led .
people want all possibilities to be checked , which allow the ex@@ iting from the municipal employer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we could not come to a satisfactory solution here , the county administration should also be in cooperation with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated cities - a skin rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the CD@@ U tries to pay better employees and officials , as the tariff for the public@@ ity service actually fore@@ seen .
the sal@@ aries are currently pre @-@ prescribed , enh@@ ances or more money there is only if you change into a higher level , which is oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute protection law .
not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy sharp@@ ens the sound to NGO migration life@@ jack@@ ets
Italy has , NGOs who use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not allowed to continue their respective rules for their operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not write a new code of code , it is difficult to see how they can continue &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said interior minister Marco Min@@ nit@@ i , in an interview with the Turin @-@ liberal daily La St@@ ampa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning come a day after the Italian authorities had conf@@ isc@@ ated a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Res@@ cue &apos; because their crew had effectively worked with human traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that facil@@ itated illegal immigration .
the aid organisation , which has only been in operation since one year , refused to express detailed provisions of Italian citizenship Ambro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o .
&quot; for us , the salvation of the human life is our top priority . so we are so sorry that we can &apos;t operate in the search and life zone in the moment , &quot; said the organisation in a statement of social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can all accus@@ ations that are currently being collected after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had the boat of &apos; Youth Res@@ cue &apos; , which monitors I@@ u@@ vent@@ a since October .
it is assumed that its crew of tu@@ g@@ boat migrants are aboard , which are delivered directly by traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can be used , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such comm@@ unions took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the acceptance of the nationality , whose contents of Italian media has been published .
the crew is suspected of being over@@ taken over the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , which monitors rescue missions in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other moti@@ fs .
under the code of code , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must mainly have an Italian police officers on board that monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue missions are now ready to keep in the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be un@@ necessarily but acceptable , as they would have no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fundamental changes or disability &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Lau@@ re@@ ate Organisation Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
meanwhile Min@@ nit@@ i said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy following the emergency measures in Italy came back in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guards and the cooperation with the local people have borne fruits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month &apos;s economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who have left these countries in hope to reach Europe .
An@@ sti@@ ege and Tri@@ als
nine W@@ eil@@ ers Bik@@ ers , the &quot; Berliner out@@ posts &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region to enjoy four days of Tri@@ als and land@@ marks .
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Valley turned out to be a good starting point for tours .
the Castle and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Micha@@ el@@ ic@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
it followed viewing points , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest and the pre @-@ bearing levels .
in the meantime , there were always long desc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als besieg@@ ed .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and the Pop@@ ular hole market .
again , look@@ out spot at the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; tri@@ als and moderate stimul@@ us .
at the last two days , many metres of altitude were told .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and shop@@ pers brought will@@ ingly P@@ ausen .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim at@@ m@@ ated the bi@@ kers in the open @-@ whe@@ eler br@@ ine br@@ ine .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 173 kilometers and nearly 4500 meters of altitude , the group had learned the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Forest from its best - sporting and cultural - to know .
console instead of grass - Bundesliga match for e @-@ sport
are the sports stars in future sit before computer @-@ sol@@ es , instead of sli@@ pping by wind and weather on the stadium bats ?
fact : e @-@ Sport has long become one of the growing industry , become a lu@@ cra@@ tive business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high g@@ ages .
these also recognised the first federal loan , which increasingly engage in this area .
at the beginning of 2015 , the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later , the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; we hope to inspire the brand new young target groups for V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Director Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
he is sure , &quot; that on this train , some clubs are rising . &quot;
next weekend , FIFA World Cup organised the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup in London , where the Gam@@ er will compete against each other .
besides bag@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven has qualified .
even Robin D@@ utt sees big potential in the E @-@ Sport .
the Ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has now been a agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football must deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people still go into the stadium , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : they tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially the Asian countries .
with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract , one could be present far more often in these markets , when only once a year the federal government will send to Asia .
what is it exactly ?
during the e @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike , &quot; or the soccer simulation FIFA to compete in competition .
long ago , as in normal sport , they are established , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and by the end of Asia , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all about a proper sport ?
for many , the idea is uncertain .
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ atic has long been dealt with the question .
for the professor at the German Sport@@ s- University in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it &apos;s com@@ peti@@ tive and many biological and physical reactions that you can also find in classic sports , for example increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , cog@@ nitive capabilities need , technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast responsi@@ veness .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise at the console but also make their body exercise and respect the diet .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
but f@@ rob@@ atic also sees problems : &quot; d@@ oping is becoming increasingly a subject . &quot;
controls are difficult for online play , and in the scene the structures of classical Sports were missing .
the scientists emphas@@ ises the high inclusive effect of E @-@ Sports .
the players are international , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no inter@@ cultural shirts .
a study by corporate consulting delay Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Inter@@ active Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) says an rapid growth in the e @-@ sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2016 will be implemented by 50 million euros in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ship and large tournaments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in three years , sales are expected to reach 130 million .
against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the football @-@ Bundesliga , this is little .
however , the e @-@ sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant .
there are many countries already .
great markets are Asia and the USA , where ex basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodriguez on the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports competitions Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is also a lot happening in Europe too .
e @-@ Sport has been introduced in a Norwegian school , says F@@ rob@@ atic .
in the Netherlands and in France , the football @-@ first league @-@ associations were obliged to establish an e @-@ sport department in the meantime , according to D@@ utt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; V@@ f@@ B Director R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in nostal@@ gia to fall in and to clear the old times , today it is not enough .
it is to preserve the tradition of the association , but the company is at the same time setting up the modern market .
&quot; we live in a digit@@ alised world , &quot; D@@ utt &apos;s too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t remember that only when it was all about football as it always was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter , because of the texts that thre@@ aten Conrad Roy to suicide , sentenced
a woman in Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encour@@ ages her friend by text and calls to suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their conviction behind bars and five years were suspended on par@@ ole .
Carter was convicted in June for the killing of Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until the vocation .
she was faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a psych@@ ic illness .
dressed in red pants and a creamy bl@@ ouse , Carter stayed there with tears in eyes , folded hands and down@@ wards oriented eyes when they was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ ute of the prosecutor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
she accepted no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
but Car@@ ters attor@@ ney said it was a &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance that they regret . &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said that he didn &apos;t find out that their &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a public prosecutor gave a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy who said that there is no day in which I don &apos;t play the loss of my beloved son .
I want that he is proud of me and how I am going with everything . I try , despite all of my pain that we will carry for eternity with us , for his sisters there , &quot; it is in it .
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will be &quot; persecuted by the realization &quot; that she will never take part in the wedding of her brother or would be a aun@@ t for his children .
&quot; no longer the only person to have come together with whom I have been together since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep for the rest of my life , &quot; she said .
the case seems to be a legitimate preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to demand another , committ@@ ing suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a hydro@@ mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle .
the case referred to national attention , after Car@@ ters told text messages that she had encouraged her to finish his life .
&quot; hanging on , spring from a building , make yourself yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was with his family on holiday .
in the eyes of his hom@@ icide , she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Everything that you must do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter was seeking attention by the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from any press of the case .
the case has shared legal opinion .
among the few who defended Carter , Amanda Knox , who was convicted in 2007 for murder of her British co @-@ residence in Italy , was acquitted of two years ago .
Mrs. Knox , 30 years old , published a comment on the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter ear@@ ns sympathy and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learn about the new Mini @-@ L@@ ess of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ i allowed me to go to the Audi Cup as captain , is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern brought a big season to the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner - extra motivation will not fail .
anything else was in his place in the cabin I saw Joshua Kim@@ i immediately , even when the extra piece was very small , very small .
but since far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp was lame and there was no Manuel New to see , he made his bar@@ k at the arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach has not announced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner was back after his first use as a Bayern captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the difference would have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but I could only interpre@@ t the sign from the coach .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal has been chosen by youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just from the holidays of the existing C @-@ El@@ f as a guide , but he .
sugar is distributed to those who want to be a lot of ingredients that you want to keep in the mood .
for those who have been chosen , the heir of the lame , a small extra motivation can only be used .
Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; this is what you want to take over as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was a mini @-@ lame on the field .
right back , that &apos;s his position , the white thread on the arm did the rest .
and at all , Kim@@ me worked in this starting formation as the one who can take the ru@@ der &apos;s best in his hand .
he gave instructions to di@@ stra@@ ct the un@@ rolled tro@@ upe .
he had the look for the whole , while many others were engaged with themselves .
Vi@@ dal therefore , not to over@@ play his missing fitness ( fol@@ dable ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches , on the devil come out to the benefits of Asia @-@ trip ( fol@@ dable also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le , in their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t are not negative .
it all worked very well .
Sü@@ le left me beside Kim@@ mir , Rud@@ y in front of the defense , both ag@@ grav@@ ated sovereign .
the well @-@ occupied Nap@@ oli storm too often did so hard , and moreover , Sü@@ le tried to successfully compete for a few times .
his colleague Rud@@ y gave up that the result wasn &apos;t that way , as we hoped for it . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance in his debut .
game leaves , speed change : &quot; I got picked up for this style . &quot;
as un@@ used this Bavaria @-@ Welt still for the new approaches , one saw the game in connection to the game .
for example , Rud@@ y did not give an example in cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs or two , but determines six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ mir retired after a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements on his new fellow player .
there he heard a very interesting phrase there : &quot; what &apos;s going on here , I already noticed .
Bayern you just have to win every game . &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new .
Al@@ aba is motivated by oil ladies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ FB women
Austria &apos;s most famous football player has appeared shortly before the game on Twitter and the Ö@@ FB ladies wish all the best .
the Bayern @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ ary is basically a quasi club @-@ mate of Ö@@ FB @-@ capit@@ als in Schn@@ ader@@ beck and fi@@ e@@ bert with our Lad@@ ys .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ alz Minister : economic pra@@ ises pace
it often proved in@@ con@@ cili@@ atory , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still the Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this shows itself after more than a year in which the new economic minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region say on T V demand from a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old Minister .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ aller Companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ dom attacks the desires of the economy , the le@@ mons are blocked . &quot;
the biggest down@@ turn is Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the L@@ ück@@ er of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Adenauer is standing in the pri@@ ori@@ ental list of the country now above .
even this year , the Ministry of Planning is expected to stand up until 2021 .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ ber@@ y Trier , which stands under the prev@@ ailing demand of the Federal Court Plan .
the aim is to take up the circuit in December 2020 , says Minister for Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees a sign for regional , but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) of Trier , as touched by Wis@@ dom , is a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to boost sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports since ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing is an open ear for people who want to set up their own company , praise the HK .
the Handwerk@@ skammer Trier sees an additional incen@@ tive for young tra@@ inees , says Managing Director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
provided a premium of 1000 Euro for the award @-@ winning master@@ piece and 2500 euros if graduates do not work independently within ten years after the master@@ ing .
the home@@ work @-@ list for the country is long .
when planned road construction works quickly to create facts , at the same time , it was out of the country at the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Main Guide of the I@@ HK Trier .
of 56 new engineers , who wants to take knowledge in the country &apos;s business operations , so far only 29 places are occupied .
the I@@ HK calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
CD@@ U @-@ S &amp; D MEP Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to the host of the host country , the country &apos;s investment in 2017 and 2018 , more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of state roads as proposed .
Frank Nat@@ us is also expecting a concept of the country , as it wants to fix the skilled workers in the region .
sober@@ ing is also the former broadband expansion in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had been rated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey with a score of 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about mol@@ ded internet connections and se@@ pul@@ s@@ ebre@@ ak@@ ings .
ex @-@ economic minister Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the wind turbines .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where they already cleared four months for in@@ consisten@@ cies again .
Audi should change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are confron@@ ted with a counter@@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would offer to update its software in more than 35@@ 0.000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW Group said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is more intelligent options as vehicle constra@@ ints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich where BMW is based - diesel vehicles to prohi@@ bit or limit a diesel vehicle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des , em@@ it@@ ates the diesel engines , are considered carcin@@ ogenic and can cause asthma .
the cost of automotive manufacturers , systems for neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles and increased exhaust gases , also take up what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with ignor@@ ing the powerful car companies and ignore the problem of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called depreciation devices to regulate the emissions , when a car was tested , but with@@ standing normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several employees were indicted by Volkswagen , others are examined at both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany last month .
the former Manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be placed in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities have accused of having committed a system to b@@ ypass the emissions legislation in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States has been expanded .
the inclusion of Audi in the study could burden Volkswagen heavy : the luxury car manufacturer is propor@@ tionally to profit from Volkswagen .

sp@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ ens and the laugh against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most viewed cartoon character , the Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ ines of his figures are his trademark .
even with 85 the Argent@@ in@@ ists still distingu@@ ishes and works in a film .
his message : laughter , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he proposed himself as a drawing for gambling cards - which was fru@@ str@@ ated .
&quot; the most happy day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said .
after stations in Lima , New York and Paris at the end of the &apos; 60s of the breakthrough : with the release of his carto@@ ons in Paris matches , and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
and again the artists of towns were inspired .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures cav@@ orting in drawings with the se@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , he also s@@ itt@@ eth his own data on the drawing , working daily for nearly ten hours daily .
about Calendar , Pu@@ zzles , Books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush favor@@ ites and watches continue to spread its dro@@ l@@ ly figures worldwide .
for six years he also works on a animated film and a TV series with his figures .
the main character in the movie &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ avi@@ los to the oldest animal in his drawings - which has a thou@@ sand@@ ler as a counter @-@ player .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie that 2019 should come to the kin@@ ol@@ factory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what they &apos;re saying , it is strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
therefore he sits rather on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is power@@ less .
lavender from Provence of climate change threatened
he became a symbol of Provence in France , but there is a warning that he is threatened with climate change .
the lavender is remembered because of the conditions of drought , and because of the diseases transmitted by the diseases , scientists and farmers , try to find solutions , great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , the expert of the agricultural research institute , CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant was exposed to the effects of climate change , which grew much less in the spring and much more in the autumn .
this has effects on the life of lavender .
there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the d@@ warf @-@ ca@@ des over@@ carries , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is a lot on the game .
lavender oil does not only lo@@ res for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also excellent for perfume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long vegetable watches with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered considered are a better water distribution and slow@@ down of ev@@ ap@@ oration in the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective blend of sound and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness .

the assassination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat of threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly magazine Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce usually meet in Wed@@ nes@@ days to review their plans for the most recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ audi@@ ble drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children into office , who were the aim of a attack with gren@@ ades in 2009 , or at home .
safety experts have written three words on a plaque on the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ r@@ ale , allies .
they ask the rep@@ orters , names for every column - no evidence is necessary to submit per@@ cep@@ tions and abdominal pain .
there are drug s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the secret list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico .
there are no rest of violence , while in all the country the bodies are frequent : at least 25 , since President Enrique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto passed his office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 have been standing by attacks and threats from federal protection and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .
among the latter is the editors and their in@@ spir@@ ator of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , co @-@ founder of Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live and journalist in Mexico , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence will be deeply felt , although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo by Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hang@@ s on the facade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building . two rep@@ orters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez , bear T @-@ shirts , who show his smiling face with glasses or its typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and the rep@@ orters discuss their shared subjects , the trau@@ ma , its night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , Par@@ ano@@ ia .
even though it was built by the Prosecutor &apos;s Office in 2010 , it has led only two criminal proceedings according to the committee , according to the Committee to protect journalists .
as with most thousands of Mor@@ den , who are associated with drug dealers and organis@@ ational crimes each year , the kill@@ ers of journalists are rarely placed on trial .
at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce they still consist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a while they are in@@ tr@@ is@@ ost@@ al , and although the terrain is still stric@@ ter .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , meeting the discussion of security of security , I@@ bar@@ ra says .
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the Why , we susp@@ end all . &quot;
in the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks , before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and was shot for 12 times , probably because of the name of the paper - which was translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ f@@ th River . &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left one woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors are incl@@ ined to w@@ ander in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing in silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans was arrested last year and the extradition of the United States in January was Sin@@ alo@@ a to become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields in the country , since rival fac@@ tions are strug@@ gling to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of , two @-@ story mou@@ ths that are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; rest &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work is Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , who viol@@ ates guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first , in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of the rival fac@@ tions in war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons .
this publication may be anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed gang@@ members bought every copy of the output when it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was in it , Val@@ dez not to force her , after the withdrawal of a other newspaper that had published the same story , to leave the country to his own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues see that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced rep@@ orters for the Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he co @-@ operated with five colleagues to the founding of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 U.S. dollars .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without step@@ ping on the poison @-@ poison problem , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said .
with time , the newspaper served a reputation for cour@@ ageous and honest coverage , and sales and advertising .
rep@@ orters loved it to publish hard tre@@ ading examinations without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship , and the readers were intri@@ gu@@ ed by a publication that they could read stories that nobody else could be treated .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for their reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists on the persecution of the Mexican drug history , wherever it led them .
he gave up voluntarily , that he was afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; drugs in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ ei@@ vi@@ ento TV last October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you have to take up the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you are playing dum@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do with so many things ... why did you not say what went on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team measures Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird who could curse like a do@@ ck@@ worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice was , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , and there always sit at the same table .
now they ask : was his love for the routine his cal@@ am@@ ity ?
her death also forced her to ask her own ass@@ ump@@ tions about how they can do their work best and to stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it , when you talk to their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home run@@ ways , to move drugs .
&quot; these things were not permitted , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ rise and self @-@ keeping .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
when it sm@@ ells un@@ true , stay away .
the trouble is , &quot; said the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing with Javier is happening . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , in Sin@@ alo@@ a are no longer - just like in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous blend of lu@@ cra@@ tive s@@ mu@@ gs , weak institutions and corrupt government officials .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce gathered for security training , suddenly there were no mobil@@ es allowed . days earlier , Spy@@ ware , who is sold exclusively to governments , to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
the outside sought two polic@@ emen from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ class district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in joke , some of the rep@@ orters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen who described the governor himself as un@@ trusted .
it has been months since the reporter went into the mountain landscape , where the drug charges de facto under control .
for the issue of this week Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce worked on three main stories .
there was the murder of the brother of Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Chavez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to state spending , focused on the home town of the Governor .
and there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the State Prosecutor , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidnapped , or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities .
a reporter learned from public notes that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician , who owned the ruling In@@ stitutional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled almost the century all political pl@@ ains .
several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of being accused of highly charged cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the reporter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man departed a military attack .
only a few months earlier , readers would have seen the column by Val@@ dez as the best inform@@ ational source about the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before we knew what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its slender body fit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
the Val@@ dez office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers that are prot@@ esting against the murders of journalists , because the staff had become something they would never expect : activists in the name of the press .
reporter Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez lam@@ ented a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist for the Office of the State Security Office .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the Western State of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is its .
journalists gathered more strongly in the country by organizing the SOS Press &quot; SOS Press &quot; organized in organised protests .
on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone to Washington and is trying to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a , on the day following the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to ex@@ termin@@ ate journalists and destroy them because they have said the truth .
she has therefore asked that she is again classified by the government because she is concerned , her anger has injured her objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez has repeatedly mentioned that journalists in Mexico organised by organised crime , involved in government officials and an equal company . &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orters were not only killed by drug professionals , but also on the command of politicians and security forces which led to organised crime under a ceiling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico , you &apos;ll die because they want you to hold your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the mor@@ de have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note that was reportedly signed by the Z@@ etas box : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones besides their separated head .
some branches have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te at the northern state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua , following the assassination of the foreign correspon@@ dent MI@@ RO@@ S@@ LA@@ VA Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue , like El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez publicly addressed the drug Cart@@ el with a Editorial on the front page with the title &quot; What do you want of us ? &quot;
some journalists escaped from their homeland or even out of the country .
it is a painful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and they are still watching the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted like the photographer Ruben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City 3 months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue to stay and continue their work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky choices .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be poet , gives the fact that drug dealers are frigh@@ tened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell and therefore I was rep@@ orters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat on the pav@@ ement in front of the office and drank beer , when all their phones began to sum@@ s up .
a range of sho@@ ots with belt ri@@ vals and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan beach had left the dead 19 confirmed dead .
the war continues , as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from Bord@@ stein@@ can@@ st , they published news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce on mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed next day .
Sir@@ ens he@@ ul@@ ten near - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez cast a look at the police officers who kept guard to see if they were in read@@ iness .
when they feared not , they showed it not .
under the powerful portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the employees of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed his footsteps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think of it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when on the same day at the Javier , the intern asked me to send them to the reporting on the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dinosau@@ rs used camoufl@@ age to ev@@ ade his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , if a sc@@ ary sc@@ ary .
now researchers found out that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ oc@@ eros of a Canadian min@@ ers were so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa der dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they could even realize that his sc@@ aly skin was brown - and they said they had something from a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot;
the report in the magazine &quot; Current Biology &quot; described him as &quot; the pat@@ tern@@ ed dinosau@@ rs ever found , and one of the best dinosau@@ rs pieces of the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered kind of No@@ dos@@ au@@ r who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years .
his incredibly well @-@ preserved state has researchers to describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the bre@@ aded vegetable carni@@ vo@@ res is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Shawn Radio when he found Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met on something that was out of the surrounding rock at the Plat@@ ze , and decided to look more precise .
the fossil discovered by him was sent into the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to exp@@ ose the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy rain p@@ ens .
after all this tough work the finished result is ready now to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you eat only a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the main actor Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will go into science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the dinosau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers found that this plant e@@ aters , although it is covered with a arm@@ or , and resem@@ bles a converting tanks , probably threatened by meat @-@ send dinosau@@ rs .
the heavily ar@@ mo@@ red dinosau@@ rs used a red and white camoufl@@ age , to hide in front of pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a par@@ ach@@ uting technique , which is also known as anti@@ d@@ elling , which is also used by many modern animals .
this could have been allowed to mix himself better in its surroundings and to avoid their enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger dinosau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature made from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made headlines in May and is now at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers now studied the wild animal and called Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum techn@@ ician Mark Mitchell , one from a team that spent more than 7,000 hours in order to exp@@ ose it carefully .
the amazing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and the form of shed and arm@@ aments over his body .
they discovered the counter sha@@ ding , a widespread defence method in animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side .
although the prev@@ enter is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta is far above the animals living today .
it suggests that the dinosau@@ rs was ch@@ ased out of sufficient pressure due to carni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ rs , the evolution of the contamination of the confron@@ tation was favourable to survival as a means of survival .
but most of contemporary animals that put the counter sha@@ ding - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or sh@@ ing@@ les - are much smaller and vulnerable as prey , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behavior on a massive , strong ar@@ mo@@ red dinosau@@ rs show how dangerous the dinosau@@ rs must have been the chal@@ k time , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosau@@ rs was bay .
scientists continue to investigate the animal on his life , including its preser@@ vative , to find out what it served as his last meal .
they believe that the dinosau@@ rs died , when he died , into a river , and driven into the sea , where he fell on the back to the sea .
at that time , Alberta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread far inland as they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is covered entirely with constant skin , but also in three dimensions , and maintains the original form of beast , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal today looks almost as it looks like in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to recon@@ struct it . if you only have a little with the eyes g@@ iel@@ s , you could almost believe that he is at bed@@ time . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when giant Ther@@ opo@@ den , carni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ rs , stood on two legs , the earth passed through .
although the king of them , Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived in millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mo@@ red dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted from some of his fur@@ ious ancestors .
this includes Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11@@ ,5 m ) long , six tonnes heavy monsters .
the scientists who appear their latest findings in current journal Current Biology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta was disp@@ osed after death in the sea and f@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
the creation was found by Shawn Radio when he found Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
according to the Museum , it is the pat@@ tern@@ ed arm@@ oured dinosau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to hips .
the creatures were approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have a weighed of up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch sp@@ ik@@ es , which ra@@ ged by his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the bre@@ aded plant e@@ aters was w@@ aved by Western Canada until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the dinosau@@ rs kept his arm@@ our in an exquisite detail .
the remains of this special specimen are so well preserved , that the ho@@ ists always cover hol@@ y@@ red arm@@ oured panels along the dinosau@@ r
as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a win in the lot@@ to .
the more I ans@@ k , the more conf@@ using it gets .
the remains of the skin still cover the hol@@ y@@ red arm@@ oured panels , carrying the skull of animal .
his right front foot lies on his side , his five fingers crossed up .
I can count the scales on its sole . &quot;
in the th@@ under@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age to A8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : nearly 30 cars are involved in a mass strike .
there are numerous injured , kilometers long st@@ aus - and g@@ aff@@ er .
on the Stuttgart @-@ Munich motorway ( A8 ) , some 20 people were injured on the late Thursday morning of a mass strike .
after the first time of the police were between 17.00 clock between the junction of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( County A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a storm of almost 30 cars , including trucks , including trucks .
there are no information about the exact number of injuries initially .
it was mild to moderate injury , said a police officer .
a large array of emergency vehicles was on the accident location .
the A8 was fully locked towards Munich .
in the course of Munich a ten @-@ kilometer ride was formed .
as a AZ @-@ reporter reports , it also came on the back way to massive disabilities - by numerous g@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade met the mark of the vehicle manufacturers , which now have to calculate with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 o &apos;clock there was yet another accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a coll@@ ision between an Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ et and a passenger car .
a b@@ ail@@ out helicopter was on the way to the accident .
German train : group tested &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it &apos;s a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing whi@@ ther@@ ing is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or one is ti@@ e@@ ft in his work and has just a brilliant thought .
and then : buffer .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and ar@@ ouses a tre@@ k , or ri@@ ps the g@@ ast in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of breaks are over soon .
Deutsche Bahn currently test@@ ers the suspension @-@ free ticket control .
you just confirm by mobile phone that we took his place and evalu@@ ates the ticket .
currently , a test run runs on two tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer comes , we extend it out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will then be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , on many other distance routes in Germany , &quot; said a railway speaker .
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; calls the rail traffic evaluation without Schaff@@ ner .
to use this , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to booked an online ticket - which is already the most passengers already anyway .
it is also necessary to have purchased the DB navig@@ ator app , which is the most convenient type of the ticket booking .
and last@@ ly , you need a seat reservation .
the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works like this : one goes on the train , calling his ticket to &quot; My tickets . &quot;
for the test clients then a button on electronic recovery is released .
the train drivers get a message to their mobile devices that Fahr@@ g@@ ast X is on the train and is used for the bench seat .
if the train station is at number Y , he knows that a passenger is already being placed on the online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , continue to keep silent .
the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which is to take advantage of the passengers .
&quot; who likes to travel without a ticket control through our mig@@ rat@@ ory personnel , check out in the DB Navigator .
this allows the passengers to design their travel time in train personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Management of DB Fern@@ correspondence .
second Plus : &quot; and our staff have more time than today to go to individual customer needs . &quot;
those who often travel , know that next to delay and pas@@ sports trains the ticket controls belong to the biggest medical devices .
because often , in any case , one of the fellow travelers does not need all the documents you need for the dev@@ al@@ uation of online tickets .
either the credit card or identity card is missing , or a document that you need to show .
the result is endless discussions between train drivers and driving pleasure , which leads to bad mood in the evenings or large @-@ room and del@@ ays in control of your own tickets and the Schaff@@ ner at the end time takes care of the other concern .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that is also just on the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further traction numbers on the same track are not un@@ available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an activist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Britt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken up to its core .
just one day after having arrived in New York City , the apartment was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her phone .
they stum@@ bled upon a post by somebody from High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 year old child , and it is still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was named there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused when nobody else had posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly ret@@ ard@@ ent on its tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body which was stretched on the street and would remain there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she thought . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she made her mobile phone , later on the evening to twe@@ ets over people on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos from the police band and people , the scre@@ amed , and from a man who claimed that Brown &apos;s father claimed to be a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police has just killed my innocent son ! &quot;
they watched a live feed at which a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a dog dog .
in another video , she said , assured another police officer , crying , &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remember@@ ing their testimony . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to us and we can call it typical . &quot;
at that moment I felt ch@@ ills .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
they booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two next morning would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the topic of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in the cinemas from the 11 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a history of survival and protest , of love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the point of view of the people living in the community and have filled the streets to request answers .
as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who carried a flower dress and a suitable crown , drove to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two people talked about this morning &quot; over the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered that which she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police had killed 18 years of boys and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take her away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it needs to know and watch it and up .
it must be well developed , not just activ@@ ism and organisation , but also know the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves .
even though I have the luck to give her an experience in which she does not experience any disgu@@ sting rac@@ ism , she is not unlike the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have the feeling I would like to point you a poor service to hold them away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first stop when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on was located on the South Flor@@ al Road , a place opposite the police authority in a camp@@ ground when the activists were awaiting the possible non @-@ accus@@ ations of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter , associated with local business@@ man , made lunch .
they prepared the po@@ ckets and hal@@ ves to pass them on prot@@ esters .
slowly , a new kind of activ@@ ism began to accept Fer@@ rell shape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism totally changed after 9 August , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ souri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food @-@ justice and health ine@@ qualities of black commun@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an evening , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r just wanted to document &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came from Fer@@ rell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document it or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Sk@@ ep@@ sis was nourished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and resistance .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently declared in an interview : &quot; we heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is known for its activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ ct occup@@ ants .
his engagement brought the project closer , together with six other locals followed the team of Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after brow@@ ns revival .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaking with us . we talk , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me as these people are represented , because I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Fer@@ re@@ lls &apos;s experience - to show that it is a &quot; Messiah &quot; movement , but around a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film .
as a result , documents show &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; a surprising personal aspects of Fer@@ re@@ lls lives , as she loves and mar@@ ries her woman .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that at this work and in the realization of black people a certain injury must be given . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ re@@ lls repeated the role of the black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , which were min@@ ted according to the killing of black te@@ ens Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 , identified the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify himself as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so we are constantly fighting in various fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women . &quot;
however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not a affir@@ matic type of action , &quot; by Fer@@ rell has been selected as a heart of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who raised up this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no coincidence , although it was at the front line because of a life at these cru@@ ises as a black , gay woman stands so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel your energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime , the news conference in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has long disappeared , but the rac@@ ist links between the community and the police remain .
Fer@@ rell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a motorway at a demonstration .
it describes the social @-@ political atmosphere of the area that they call their home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
nonetheless she mour@@ ns to a singing and she feels under this memorial , since she went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ ahn &quot; : TV readers discuss bit @-@ gallery
the bit @-@ gallery moves the people , although it is not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south of the pedestrian zone has been un@@ folded since the first presentation of 2009 the population in pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents .
cold the subject hardly takes one .
on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg , &quot; the topic will be discussed .
while the one at the Bit Gallery say : &quot; this would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; That would be real class &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ est ) , comes from the other side : &quot; does not need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ ate ) or quite simple : &quot; meg@@ al@@ ms ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while pro@@ pon@@ ents are building that a gallery draws more customers into the city , of which the other businesses benefit from , fear the enemies , that the pedestrian zone should be bleeding .
in addition , the gallery will be planned on the premises in which the farmers market stands , in which 13 direct marketing will offer their products .
at the beginning of the construction work will be at the end .
the gallery mo@@ vers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and the Bed@@ a place with possibility to sit outside .
Simone Room : &quot; we have been selling almost weekly in the rustic market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land@@ lords are always happy again .
we discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s but@@ cher for us too .
we would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing is located in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new project is probably not just low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what shopping branches in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find this superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are already enough in our city .
one sees how many shop@@ pers are empty here - some since months and years .
but since there is not even one regular weekly market here , it is even more important that at least the market stands at least remains .
after all , the goods offered there is fresh , mostly offered by producers and is ob@@ sc@@ less expensive .
as you can see , loads shops in a shopping center will only be rented by bigger companies , because the local players are often not portable .
too bad , special business is almost no longer and what is left over , will probably disappear as well . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall fits me not together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
especially : where is the farmers market riding during the construction time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even if the bit @-@ gallery actually comes to some point .
or does it already make the gh@@ o@@ st bit Gallery previously to distribute all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it simply won &apos;t work .
and an shopping center that is empty , no one needs .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery .
but there is no place for a farmers market , thanks to the mad@@ ness of many - how I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more space .
when the farmers &apos; market is broken , a piece of culture will van@@ ish . &quot;
a perfect resem@@ blan@@ ce : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the center of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ measur@@ able - that hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ cker and Haar@@ lem by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth where the former secret service analyst had used a 35 @-@ year sentence after she publicly laid diplomatic records on the website Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
the new exhibition , opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ blan@@ ce ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg whose discipline was transformed into technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ former and landmark report whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA that could be extracted from Mann@@ ing and created out of 30 portraits , if any intellectual comment does not only look at the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inher@@ ent determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing who was born in Bradley Edward II , but has been openly pronounced on identification as a woman , was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
by the prison , their image was supp@@ ressed , so very that there was only one photo - a grain , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , sitting in a driver sitting at a driver seat and a platinum @-@ blonde Persian carries - with whom she was associated with .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
in this , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cig@@ ars and chew@@ ing gum , and extracted the DNA from the waste to create a picture of how these people might look like .
that was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg explained in a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she could not be visited at this time and she could not be photographed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were un@@ equal together , that over two years later , several letters broke out in the course of two years .
they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o Illu@@ stri@@ erte Comic &quot; Supp@@ ose Images , &quot; which would translate a future in which the President Chel@@ seas would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ing became the release of seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome way of happy comm@@ unions .
there are also now at the opening of the exhibition there is something deep and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tr@@ ump introduces a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the governmental camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ aked ways , which he should fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the strange timing of all these things , she said that things happen from a certain reason . &quot;
in a laying on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing signed with her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name ) is an end of the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis is gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on opposite wall is the mit@@ ochondri@@ al DNA sequence - a thou@@ sand@@ ing of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show the inclusion of the 200 characters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ de after the highly developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) , as aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we all are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we hope to take away , is that our gen@@ ome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data for a interpretation and how sub@@ jective they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic book .
it shows Mann@@ ing , as she emerg@@ es with a release of hands in the United States , such as King Kong .
&quot; if they ch@@ ill your speech , then they have won , &quot; it means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came straight from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - as it was supposed to be taken out in the comic book - but if they should do it , then it will be greeted in the middle of the room of the masks made from their own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ ul@@ ators , which summar@@ ises like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
that was also goal @-@ oriented , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ atur ) , with which their genetic h@@ ap@@ on@@ ists were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted it to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that talks with Chelsea as the movement , which was also behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
studied University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford for murder
a nationwide human hunting is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who have been sought for susp@@ ects a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday were issued for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) war@@ rants for murder of alleged involvement in Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County .
the documents tell that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au died , 26 , after several bul@@ lets died .
a common warning system was made by the Chicago Police Department that the bodies was discovered on July 27 .
civil servants received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found victims with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still explained on the place of action for dead , and det@@ ective stories the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police actively searching for the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
L@@ ath@@ em has been an extraordinary professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail explanation that L@@ ath@@ em was now being l@@ ur@@ king and excluded from entering the North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter being investigated by the competent authorities and North@@ western University co @-@ operated with this examination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said garbage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Assistant Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ man of the University and the Somer@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail address that &quot; we are in touch with the police in Great Britain and ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in every conc@@ ei@@ vable way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ rens colleagues were shocked , and want to put himself up .
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Department of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he demanding the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has a presentation of her residence and our efforts to loc@@ alise it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help finding the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building that had just received a en@@ ig@@ matic tip that had just happened in the apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene as a very cruel one .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27th .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the sacrifice had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management team of Grand Plaza re @-@ published an explanation of the residents : &quot; the police currently works on the time axis and the background of the victim and explo@@ res a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - the Russian vice @-@ president mut@@ ko
the Russian vice @-@ president Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not last long until the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented for restoration of the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has received the right to plan and test them in collaboration with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this regard , &quot; says Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA schedule to comply with the code that describes the criteria for the implementation of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko he doesn &apos;t contain anything , which could give concern for Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one of the criteria listed in the list however states that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities approved the reported results from the WA@@ DA by the Canadian attor@@ ney Richard McLaren leading to alleged government @-@ sponsored d@@ op@@ ings in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we conduct the investigation as our anti @-@ D@@ oping system has pushed a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
but there was no government programs , and we won &apos;t admit something that doesn &apos;t exist . &quot;
Mut@@ k@@ os words voted with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping commission .
in conversation with Russian sales department r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping organisations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly mentioned that the reports are disputed and rules .
nobody wanted to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the wake of d@@ oping sc@@ and@@ als from WA@@ DA to the implementation of d@@ oping control in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after visiting the headquarters in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli stated that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA declared itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the right direction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be used again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ di sold no eggs anymore .
these were shared with the corporate group .
it is a pure precau@@ tionary measure that could not be assumed for any health imp@@ air@@ ment , it was stated in the message .
from now on , only eggs can be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been tested negative on fi@@ li@@ ent anti @-@ shell pattern .
Al@@ di wants to restore clarity and transparency to its customers .
start @-@ ups to help your company will not become the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ rett wanted to measure your colleagues at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the p@@ olls didn &apos;t work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised An@@ ony@@ m@@ ity , some workers were not gri@@ eving the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ rett , who operates the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed .
she called people from the outside to help .
a new race of human resources star@@ tu@@ ups is at Wach@@ te@@ sen to help companies to find out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licensing of software that has enabled the specific purpose of measuring the employee involvement , it enables companies to address surveys , Special groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ s allow C @-@ Suite managers to handle and apply directly to the board of directors .
&quot; they now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools is used to measure employees .
Er@@ rett said she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel at G@@ lin@@ t in the three years .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap p@@ olls and p@@ olls of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company , which shows a glance , which units have the most complaints and which managers have low @-@ use results - so you can pursue , why .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , you do not have to be the next U@@ ber , who has been involved in Sk@@ and@@ als , since then a former employee describes a blog post which describes a environment of ins@@ ults , with the ones who have spoken .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this desire is for an overview of a lu@@ cra@@ tive business possibility .
global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion value by 2020 according to the Financial Technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Denver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent heart behaviour and recognise a rising interest and activity in early this year , am@@ id@@ st the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
convert almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ t makes company tailor @-@ made &quot; pul@@ s- &quot; surveys , confi@@ dential answers to real time and view the heat @-@ maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hotline with which employees can report evil behavior .
and if the chief executive guide is involved , complaints are directly to the board of directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the public opinion has recorded the regulations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that his employees were badly treated or behave eth@@ eth@@ ically , it may experience costly consequences by consumers &apos; boy@@ cott , employee flu@@ ence and passages , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has used Conver@@ cent for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures , and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
earlier , if an employee would have to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company headquarters , a formal complaint and hope that it was taken seriously .
it was often a ti@@ mid@@ able and un@@ comfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said , there was no good opportunity to pursue the complaints of employees .
well , since the company conver@@ ts Conver@@ cent , problems that were previously were hiding in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or in@@ qu@@ icker practition@@ ers are identified and addressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this hol@@ istic , 360 @-@ degree view into experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano who leads the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders in employment legal disp@@ utes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
company began to take eth@@ ics , values and employees working in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen broke up for ethical violations by the Enron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they realized that they could not prevent their dirty work online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor the eth@@ ics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent provide your software as a service , and the companies with recur@@ ring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that finds the approval of venture capital investors who support both start @-@ ups .
convert $ 10 million for funding in February of firms such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , bringing up the total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itters secured $ 10 million in November by Bess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought its entire financing to $ 60 million .
this investment is hardly surprising , in view of the connected nature of enterprises , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only w@@ agers .
employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the people are happy to be in a company that they have heard their voices , and that the work that you do is worthwhile , then they feel more strongly committed to make this company successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Employ@@ ee Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which is used as well as G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors get Ren@@ ders if their portfolio companies run smoothly . companies run fine if employees are employed and engaged .
if the analy@@ tics @-@ tools promise third @-@ party promise , commitment and deployment of employees , it is no wonder that you can find support .
the data about employee involvement according to experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data are us@@ eless when the company does not take action .
in fact , if a company asks staff after your feedback , it may have a expec@@ tation that change is on the way .
and if the change is not fast enough , or at all , this can motiv@@ ate dis@@ appointments and employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company very much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow employees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do you really hear me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about that ?
and if you don &apos;t care about why should I ? &quot;
Madison Reed , who now runs monthly employee p@@ olls , was able to lead action on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so er@@ rett .
and after the collector &apos;s feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees she was able to re @-@ organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .
among Ruby Tuesday , the company will always get new insights into the staff , and it hopes that for a long term , this leads to a better binding of workers in a sector , which is well @-@ known for high sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and if you lose man , you also lose customers .
and if you lose customers , then you will lose company .
the N@@ CAA removes two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for Bru@@ ins
it &apos;s about 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A Foot@@ ball@@ ers enter@@ tained on one side of the teams &apos;s new exercise fields on the campus .
some took off their tri@@ cot parts and show off the back of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these un@@ just minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are enrolled at the summer courses are returning after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to their closing checks , before they return to the water man Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 am .
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real pedal mill , &quot; Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a said before Monday to Tuesday .
the N@@ CAA eliminated two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the burden of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
for this reason , the first three training session of the U@@ CL@@ A will start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the players already completed .
the com@@ promises away from the two days is more than a day when the brood moved to the camp almost a week after the last season , during the summer school during Mor@@ as six hours in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they are expected to stop 18 exercises in the course of August 18 . 20 before the start of formal playing preparations for their pre@@ lu@@ de to Texas A &amp; M in September .
MOR@@ A said he assi@@ sts the change in the N@@ CAA , even if they add a further point to the number of busy routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous burden on three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just pressed it , they spread over , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it &apos;s really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end their practices when the camp is finished , in view of the clear Si@@ eving of its fields from an ad@@ joining parking and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class , which is already filled with foot balls , which will be a protective network behind a Tor@@ p@@ fo@@ ster , no easy task .
brood @-@ players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people get there a room and set up there to record a practice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video clip of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best of what we have .
therefore I don &apos;t have to worry too big .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against fake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential items with in@@ correct coverage by third parties and their findings under the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News .
the company said in a position on his website , that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to recognize possible counterfeit messages and send them to fac@@ ulty check out of the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main contribut@@ ors to so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , many of which believe they have also influenced US presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem is also become a major political subject in Europe , where French voters were flooded in May with wrong stories , and Germany will support a plan according to social media networks if they could not succeed in over@@ flowing Post@@ ings as before the elections in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in English , that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany will start a test of the new facts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to knowledge which stories of fac@@ simile review of third parties , want to make people more context to make sure what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara , Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she added that Facebook continues to test his feature to the &quot; in conjunction with the article &quot; and works on other changes to its news feed to reduce wrong messages .
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was visible in a sque@@ eze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ er years .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history of his cozy seat in the O@@ ent River Valley in K@@ ent and is now the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mop@@ olitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to watch the hand@@ writing of somebody who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says so much . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship , to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . Isaac L@@ enk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg .
it is not the first book written by Rhodes , which is based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have only responded to the thum@@ b pressure on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s years , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is his thum@@ b print !
and the letters still smell like smoke , because then one burned a fire because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect when he himself was also involved .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who has sm@@ itten so with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England , and almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have a little over@@ rated &quot; ) seems to be true to be true .
Rhodes spent his days to study the Vict@@ orian &apos; New &apos; castle to study the archives and to study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mon@@ ot@@ ted hy@@ ena heads around the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ches .
he immig@@ rated through the grounds and ruins of the old castle , and spoke with land@@ scap@@ ing , gar@@ den@@ ers , and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , he drank &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust was only given the full access to 2006 when the last I am , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Rhodes met a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archives that he said as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hundreds of years in which aristoc@@ rats told &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , throw it up to the attic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
diary , letters from the time of the English Empire , maps that had what they possessed : &quot; you could mean that country @-@ fol@@ lic@@ t would be boring , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch in order to have fought two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all its way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to enter the wider base in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man that leaves the newly built castle to join the farmer &apos;s estate of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a ri@@ ot that occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , Rhodes .
&quot; the pe@@ asant uprising began in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good beginning .
perhaps the two are connected together ? &quot;
other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the history of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ er , whom the family Dar@@ rell hid seven years during the English Re@@ formation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; in which the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell was portra@@ yed out of the 18th century by being a sar@@ g filled with stones ( a discovery that was made until after the Sar@@ g was dug later ) .
the actors are Rhodes &quot; favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the masters seemed to be a very happy g@@ aun@@ er , always make money back and spending money for things they couldn &apos;t afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell men ri@@ sts their school crises by giving rich old women , I imagine it as a he@@ ap of good looking guys , with a talent to promote land@@ within . &quot;
after the end of his approach in the castle Rhodes looking for other unique scre@@ am experiences
he has spent a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been demanded by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
it was like : &quot; Oh , now I have to get ready again with the dam@@ ned life . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ chapel is covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the dis@@ closure of the 301 year @-@ old Mari@@ chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started their campaign to launch a new umbrella brand ( Frankfurter Rundschau of Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team by Nelson Art@@ z will keep the logo and slogan secret .
at the end of August , there will be a celebration of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too nice for us .
or ? , &quot; the makers of the promotion has been on posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel yesterday .
&quot; we think this ( of course ! ) does not really &quot; write them on her yesterday un@@ locked website .
&quot; but we use this measure to win your attention .
and to make it clear that something is better than it seems .
basically , we are the firm conviction that we know as a Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens around the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
when action , it is more than just a logo and a slogan , it continues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a stand@@ alone promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique item . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
eventually they stand in the competition with other municipalities .
a middle five @-@ digit amount makes the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost their new loft and campaign .
military forms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the Army
every year , at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) advis@@ es over pension@@ ers and transport operations .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal operation .
but nothing is routine at the Turkish armed forces a year after putting Putin .
the meeting did not take place in the General Staff building , as previously , but at the prime minister of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the government , the five vice @-@ president as well as the ministers for defence , home affairs , judi@@ ci@@ ary and foreign affairs .
thus , civilians in the Y@@ as were in the transition .
the government is moving the re@@ ins in the military .
general Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were set off .
since the failed coup , President Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and ad@@ mir@@ ers .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - usually because of alleged connections to the movement of exile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erdo@@ gan as a wire s@@ attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people who are directly involved in the attempt of attempt , it is negoti@@ ating in Ankara since this week .
on the day after the put@@ sch of Erdo@@ gan , Erdo@@ gan had referred to as the &quot; divine present &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to cleanse the armed forces . &quot;
but did Erdo@@ gan really handle the army ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; Dis@@ comfort in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
in the general staff , there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which manifest itself among other things in the up@@ lift of the head ban for Sol@@ dat@@ as , the newspaper wrote .
the large @-@ s@@ wimm@@ ers in the army and the security forces anyway continues .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan sent another 73@@ 95 citizen , among them 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers .
it seemed like Erdo@@ gan is t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the real masters of the country .
three times , it was calling on appeal to their role as a custo@@ dian of the world leaders .
following his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed the power of the military step towards step , not least under calling on the reform of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is doing targeted by Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe , &quot; a well @-@ known officer accused of fear of persecution from persecution in political asylum , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; in a few years .
if this applies to , such development could not be cold .
in the alliance , in the Alliance , there are doubts about the willingness to work for the Turkish army .
the management structures and operational skills be &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; Nato diplom@@ ats say .
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
it will give a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media .
it looks ahead to lower the legal immig@@ rant to 50,000 per year , more str@@ ingent regulations for the visa of visa for a temporary work permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in both chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , save wages and billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by the U.S. will change the way as the citizens from other countries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
this new candidate procedure will come to the candidates who have the financial resources to support themselves and knowledge that our economy will come good , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media .
Ministry wants to indul@@ ge road transport shuttle
again , over the past few months , over the future of the racing team had been fought - now it &apos;s supposed to go quickly .
before the end of the year , at the end of the year , the tourist train is going to be built .
to secure the future of the racing team in the long term , we are expected to start work on the route according to the traffic ministry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to order and renov@@ ate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country has designated for the tourism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important link &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stated by traffic secretary at Klaus S@@ üh@@ l , on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost for the repair of the route he raised to about 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country take 75 percent .
the contract , on which the Shuttle will also be ordered in the future of the country , will definitely be matched , explained S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and southern railway are on the basis of the technical details already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
as a result , the speed@@ ART Shuttle should be ordered regular on December 2017 .
the racing @-@ sti@@ ff shuttle is a popular train connection between the railway stations of Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
during the past months , the course had been tested as part of a pilot project , whether the course of sufficient many people will be used to order them again in the future .
the route is also very strong in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about
just as you thought that it cannot be crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start taking up their as@@ cen@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose the ey@@ epi@@ ece of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and type of finger nails .
&quot; people are making fun , but the companies deliver lots of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key for the release of his new report .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots using a silicone skin that feels warm - consciously or human reactions that are achieved through artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can adjust his robot according to his beliefs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and choose everything from the eye color of the robot via the shape of ni@@ p@@ ples to type or color of his finger nails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there will be more wor@@ rying as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a Step@@ an @-@ wife progressive .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed to robots using a silicone skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example to custom@@ ize its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they are appealing , such as rel@@ ent@@ ness .
and then there is still the True Comp@@ an@@ ion developed by True Comp@@ an@@ ion and called &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; with pre@@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; which convey@@ s the impression of rel@@ tern@@ ity and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the site of true Comp@@ an@@ ion .
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you like , etc .
in the course of the day , she also has its m@@ oods - quite like real people !
it can be tired , fixed on conversation or it can be &quot; in mood . &quot;
there are many wor@@ rying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they can replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ du@@ ous female properties that ad@@ mits a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : resi@@ den@@ ying ) Far@@ rah is wor@@ ris@@ ome a most distur@@ bing one .
on his website true @-@ true Comp@@ an@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vi@@ br@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vi@@ br@@ ator , why can men do not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it &apos;s on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toys .
their emergence and increased refin@@ ement indicate something dark and deeper into our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with sub@@ jection as an optional en@@ core .
most men of course will not stop sex robots , and while FR@@ R remember their rising popularity , they remain preliminary at the edge of consumer culture .
but what is le@@ ak@@ ened out of the boundary zones , in terms of the spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting , until the free market is given to them .
there is a certain sur@@ ge that these highly developed sex robots are endangered in a time , in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House , who has mo@@ asted women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most awesome aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the swallowed body and the extinct eyes , but how realistic this vision appears .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump .
the goal behind these sex robots has a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
her inheritance is that they feel human feeling that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , at the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities &quot; there is no real women .
you can &apos;t separate or go away from their companion .
they have no medi@@ ation or background background , nothing that could distur@@ b on independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total sub@@ jug@@ ation .
different : they are fake slaves .
or to express it in the speech of 2017 : maid service
tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the it@@ ome of a healthy human mind
it has become a Bin@@ sen@@ ator of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political sp@@ ades , which have polarized US voters , have also divided families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and Than@@ ksgiving day , there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of tr@@ ump @-@ selectable relatives .
we all allegedly committed ourselves to burst our filter bubbles .
less noticed is the power tr@@ um@@ ps , families together .
I mention this because my cousin , a left @-@ left poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been visiting New York for a long time with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
they re@@ minded me that unity can have an enormous effect against a common enemy .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone knows whom she knows , including the republi@@ can transformation , with whom she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side .
in order to meet the dining table it &apos;s certainly a good thing , but it falls in another context that this also brings significant risks .
the Left was strengthened by tr@@ ump , but the effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and &quot; tr@@ ump &quot; we refer to the gr@@ us@@ el@@ ly possibility that we will no longer reject our bi@@ b of a day .
there is , however , a still frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario , in which Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as the ep@@ it@@ ome of failure .
I find myself nowadays from an active nostal@@ gia to Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s strange version of crazy version - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump is indeed a very mild crime .
when dr@@ ump passes , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be only spirit@@ ually healthy to qualify as an im@@ measur@@ able improvement .
when my cousin in the city was , we brought our children to car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the biggest of the Car@@ us@@ el in Central Park , and the top three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cra@@ cking and the animals are turning to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the clim@@ atic music convey@@ s this curious way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appo@@ inting : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines become familiar to provide much excitement , and the reality of the city will not meet the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not all over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the subject @-@ pub ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not counting - but a large round@@ about in the north of London .
however , the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magical experience , as here two two @-@ year @-@ old , one 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women can go on it and all have a great time .
when I was able to evaluate the car@@ ous@@ el , I had given him the full score , but fortunately nobody was asked .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I was able to pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it &apos;s the same , plus the option to buy the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the shop .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality to a situation in which no need is required .
the poor woman in the department store stood guilty , while I we@@ ari@@ ed the experience to rich my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us re@@ located with breast pain from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital stay for the second time .
last year , he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of failure to the hospital , which he suffered from prison to a fall in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convicted of murder after an appeal against the prosec@@ ut@@ ors of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of the Valentine &apos;s morning of 2013 , by sending them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pret@@ oria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he had his girlfriend for a night int@@ ru@@ der , who hidden himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they were too op@@ aque .
the National prosecution authority said that it will be issued by the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the ob@@ jection can be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years when the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when farmer Arnold is a strange egg
as last of the Blum@@ berger Schools , the four @-@ cl@@ ink@@ ers from barrels and ec@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dischar@@ ged into the vac@@ ations and in the continuing schools .
three of the school students are going to school in school , four at secondary school .
school director Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parent and representative of the public in Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen on Tuesday evening .
the 29 students of four classes under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der chose a young eag@@ les that grows in chickens , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the m@@ lower Sch@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in chickens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it from his chickens .
instead of a chicken breast , there was a small eagle .
but the hope , from him a chicken , sm@@ ash himself , and the eag@@ les spread out his wings at a high mountain .
after that , the grades showed three and four in the training of Y@@ vonne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens danced with the young go@@ ches , the cylinders wore to the bet .
the eag@@ les stand for integration , said school director Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te .
the young man was different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( ch@@ icks ) , but belonged to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
its destiny is to be free .
they wanted every four @-@ cl@@ erg@@ ent that he has felt in his new school .
it was followed by than@@ ksgiving to the colleagues , the former school director Michael Mu@@ eller , who has always jumps with the material of teaching , and the parents representation .
the Kü@@ ken@@ zeit is now over , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher .
she ref@@ uses to leave her students after two years of teaching just because it was a really great time .
finally , she can rely on the vier@@ lander .
finally , all students had a song of summer time and holiday season .
with the children , great joy broke out .
eight first @-@ cl@@ ink@@ ers have already registered for the new school year .

software update for diesel vehicles : what do you need to know now ?
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
in the diesel @-@ summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offers software updates available for a total of approximately 5.3 million vehicles .
they are intended to improve the emission behaviour of the Euro 5 emission standard and some EUR 6 emissions .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin from the ACE Auto Club Europa are ass@@ essments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the handled software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates are valid only for the vehicles that have called Schumann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their re@@ armament has arranged the Federal Chancell@@ ery of the Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a significant implementation in the next few months , but is still no exact date .
Daimler informed , to write any affected parties .
if due to an inspection , this will be done in their frames .
how long will the equipment changed altogether ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; S@@ met@@ anin means .
the hang@@ s of engagement from the manufacturer as well as political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers are not acting on the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the upgrade itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time consuming could be to get an appointment .
what do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE advis@@ es to wait .
probably , foreign manufacturers could im@@ itate as S@@ met@@ anin .
is now a massive discounts of Euro @-@ 4 cars now ?
the ACE fears it .
but in the regions where passengers are dro@@ pping .
in rural areas there is no loss of value for older diesel .
the ACE advis@@ es to wait for sale with a sale .

we make the city liv@@ able
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes into retirement in the upcoming year .
the job is already written - suitable candidates are rare .
for 31 years , W@@ ack@@ ers has been a city master .
and the work makes it still great fun , as it convey@@ s in press report .
he reports varied , but also demanding tasks that wait for his successor .
at the same time , it amaz@@ es him that so far there is no application to fulfill the requirement profile .
the city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the next time .
thus , - under the le@@ ase of regular termination periods - is still enough time for a work .
since Has@@ lach was for the administrative community as a sub @-@ legal authority , the applicant must submit appropriate provisions .
because this function aims to keep the town definitely .
if the citizens would not have to fill them out , the citizens would have to travel to Offen@@ burg .
but the close to the city is the city and itself important , W@@ acker says that is reported by a good operating climate as well as a good mood between authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office some important projects gathered together , looking back to the h@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are making the city liv@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the Bau@@ amt and his staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , there are varied projects on the agenda : the design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the parking lot around are an@@ gled .
the Kin@@ etic Bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium restoration is still topic .
the latter alone will strike at some 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it properly , &quot; W@@ acker estimates .
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor .
work here is fun . &quot;
conf@@ ec@@ aged for a Stadt@@ bau@@ chery large play room .
Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building yard and gar@@ den@@ ner@@ ei can be re@@ flexi@@ bly respon@@ sive to multi@@ plying .
&quot; it can move much , &quot; says W@@ acker , &quot; and the design of the green spaces will be praised by citizens and visitors .
since the old town stands as ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye to what it fits , &quot; when new@@ builds are approved , the separ@@ ating city master .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ chery carries high responsibility .
it is a builder , &quot; at the end everything runs here over my table . &quot;
for assistance and coordination , he can count on long @-@ term employees : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( high @-@ construction ) has been working for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) has been for 15 years .
also that his successor is long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify himself and stay with the place . &quot;
because continuity is not only important for a good operating climate , but also for the further development of the city .
who wants to bury Roland W@@ acker , should be completed following the information of the City of Has@@ lach ; a graduate engineer or Bachelor , with specialized knowledge architecture , and have good knowledge in the fields of construction and construction plans .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt under@@ go high@@ - and civil engineering , construction planning , Gr@@ is@@ wer@@ b@@ san@@ itation , administration of urban emb@@ assies , urban operation with construction and municipal law@@ suits , and under@@ wear construction rights , including monument protection .
bicycle on lines thrown : south @-@ track blocked
according to the police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bike from the train track in the lead road ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were badly damaged , that the her@@ mits had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male servants and search for the night hours after them .
near the crime scene , witnesses and a bike driver were observed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that goes far beyond a couple of Laus@@ anno@@ ys , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rators , or the perpet@@ rators , had brought himself into great danger and at risk of transport .
besides the damage to the Lo@@ k and the plant , as well as the delay @-@ minute and the cost of rail traffic , the railway customers could also come to the perpet@@ rators .
altogether , the spokes@@ man said . overall , the spokes@@ man said .
the damages were re@@ fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south route could be guided without disabilities .
nearly ten people had fallen Friday morning , two of them entered the remote traffic .
goods did not come out , but they were delayed .
according to Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of the pi@@ pelines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate can help to re@@ lie@@ ve IB@@ D ( un@@ wit@@ ness@@ ing intest@@ ine )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study asser@@ ts exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could re@@ lie@@ ve symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States in the United States , causing mag@@ nit@@ es and paraly@@ sis , recur@@ ring or bloody attacks , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness .
while the affected are usually lost , meat and dairy products found to avoid their symptoms , researchers at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells in the intest@@ ine van@@ ishes to make sure that dam@@ aging micro@@ bes that hide in eating , not penet@@ rate into the body .
cells that are inher@@ ent to dis@@ solving inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without dam@@ aging sensitive tissues .
when equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bo@@ wel process .
in experiments , a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell in mice was found that a certain bacter@@ ium is in their inn@@ ards .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the blocks of proteins - to resolve the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus ter@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ ines micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ rich nutrition toler@@ ates , less flamm@@ able intestinal mi@@ li@@ eus , if the same system also helps people work .
the post@@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan under@@ took a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance as they found out that a group of female mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe that had not been separated , but had not had this .
they presum@@ ed that the difference between the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ble of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , who normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the her@@ edit@@ ary mice were detected DNA sequ@@ enced and there were six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells , but without them in mice .
mice were re@@ ared in a sterile environment , so that they had not been a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome , and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria re@@ acted to the immune system , the researchers abandoned L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then led little amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells , which were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed to toler@@ ate toler@@ ant cells .
when active component has been cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ metabolism known as the In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of mice , the number of such cells climbed by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same toler@@ ant @-@ promoting cells as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect us in our gastro@@ intestinal tract .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as with mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is prob@@ able that we want to promote because these cells control infections on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han are present in presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic .
at Manchester United who signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pound of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre@@ season game before the UEFA Cup match against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday , and impressed you in the holder role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira .
however , M@@ atic had been excluded from the blues in Asia with the blues and only took 45 minutes to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League @-@ season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks soccer , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic started Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u started his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Independent revealed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still revealed three further claims , but he insi@@ sted that the club has already done a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fantastic work &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; three of his four mandatory new commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , thank you for the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they got four of four , but they have given me great trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; painted &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky .
the pilot flew from Seattle in the US state Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan , and moved in the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar antenn@@ as , the shape of a dre@@ am@@ lin@@ ers was to be .
the whole thing was a lasting test for new engines .
Boeing had already done such advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new bill for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns off : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD boss , the Socialist and Democ@@ rat Prime Minister always looked at a certain concern about Berlin .
merely no stor@@ ks of the party headquarters , merely no counter@@ wind from the federal government - so the most important desire of the election battles .
since Martin Schulz , the party has changed .
since then , the employees from Willy @-@ Brandt &apos;s house has been watching with growing dis@@ semin@@ ating events in the SPD @-@ gover@@ ned state capit@@ als .
what Schulz has been from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described by counter@@ wind in the base .
there were deep things .
and one after the other .
the federal @-@ CD@@ U look after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green can easily be reliable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the German editor of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising frac@@ tional fra@@ ction of a Gre@@ at@@ al M@@ EPs has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a heavy crisis .
five months before the road @-@ election , its red @-@ green coalition lost its single @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Party leader Michael Kell@@ ner promp@@ ted the sec@@ ular Green Party leader El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to return their mandate .
the transfer to the CD@@ U is a clear de@@ for@@ gery of the voters .
El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets must immediately return their mandate , &quot; said the Federal Executive Officer and a campaign for the Green Party Leader Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sigh@@ ted a SPD election , when on Friday morning the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ message reaches the party headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after crossing the green M@@ EPs from El@@ ke T@@ west to the CD@@ U without its own government majority .
it is the provisional peak of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD country associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere began with an unexpected defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , no more , spar@@ ked the com@@ rades at that time .
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
this then became - and it was all clearly worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the deaf m@@ ower , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite breath@@ ed the party .
el@@ ti@@ ously ra@@ ped his com@@ rades in the weeks afterwards .
then , when she had exhausted new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next turn .
Mayor O@@ laf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burnt .
and because he was doing pretty wrong in the crisis communication so quite everything you can do wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for his political survival .
now also Stephan Weil .
because of the VW @-@ emission standards and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister has already been in cri@@ tique .
mi@@ ese re@@ frac@@ tures were added .
nevertheless , or maybe , because , because in recent weeks , Since the past few weeks , we tried to set acc@@ ent acc@@ ents .
the punishment of the former mayor of Hanover , his power in Berlin , was not hidden in com@@ rades in the environment of Martin Schulz .
they left him , because they spoke of because a stabil@@ isation of the party .
now , the exact opposite could occur .
because in this regard , because of the parties , the green @-@ Sax@@ on green is not guilty .
and Schulz did not even say .
therefore , the com@@ rades make an effort to keep their own ranks .
their anger is aimed at the Gre@@ ens , and in particular the par@@ atro@@ cities par@@ liament@@ ar@@ in .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , such as Mrs. T@@ jack@@ ets of their own career meetings with the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , Chief of the Party in the SPD Parliamentary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Ms. T@@ west has not been elected as a direct candidate because of its person as a direct candidate , but on the national list of the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party .
the logical consequence is that it returns its mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD Parliamentary Group , compl@@ ains a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters turned four years ago : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men have made Stephan Weil appointed Prime Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony candidate in the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the personal career credits of a future CD@@ U @-@ MPs for@@ ged the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he requested to clari@@ fy the backgrounds .
I want to know if there has been more or further comm@@ itments from the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding of the city centre III
who wants to renov@@ ate his house in the years , can get soon support from the country .
also informed Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg city development on Wednesday in sens@@ ations .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ ind@@ ler en@@ acted once again a review of the previously thought .
since 1991 there has been in sensi@@ cal remedi@@ ation areas .
back then , in the Z@@ uri@@ an area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount .
the division remained at least 60 percent in the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016 .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous remedi@@ es are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it was finally important to promote the interior development and not only close to new areas .
on 4 April , the Regier@@ ungsp@@ rä@@ si@@ dium Karlsruhe gave information that it will be a re@@ ten@@ ding area III .
the total funding amounts to 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the congregation sens@@ ations .
how do you develop a renovation area ?
one will continue to investigate so Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
however , it also plays a role whether in the planned area , in the interest of interest , to renov@@ ate .
if necessary , the territory may then move again .
the cancellation represented on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
cellar presented the contents of the federal states program &quot; Social City , &quot; in which frame would then be carried out .
core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alisation of inner city cities , the improvement of residential and employment relations and preservation and expansion of infrastructure .
the measures would have objective , that means per plot , carried out .
the renovation area would then finally be set as a stat@@ ute .
as of January 1 , 2017 , the effective period for funding is still running until 30 . April 20@@ 26 .
even until September this year , however , only once the existing power plant would be carried out , as part of those involved in the annex@@ ation area involved a questionnaire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in November or December , the proposition of stat@@ uses must be made , which will begin with the renov@@ ations in the coming year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then explained that every municipality had to perform the pre@@ valent incident examinations .
it is therefore to evaluate and decide urban resi@@ du@@ es , and decide when sanc@@ tioned and in which extent .
it will also be registered for the respective property in the book book .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again after emotions and get a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel empha@@ sized , an essential success factor for the project was the participation of those involved .
therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires who are sent to citizens in the coming weeks , and will be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building and plot section , &quot; which is among other things about the structural condition and the restoration inten@@ tions .
in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; household appliances and housing , &quot; data can be made to size , division , and inhabitants of an area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; factory bow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only allowed to fill in the building &apos;s premises . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , to consider , Got@@ zel pointed out that a fulfilled questionnaire is not simultaneously an application for funding .
moreover , new structural measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler still empha@@ sized that the distribution of funding is based on the &quot; Wind@@ surfing principle &quot; - who first comes , m@@ ah@@ lt first .
there is no funding to reserve for later . &quot;
for the end , photos of the project &quot; village centre II &quot; were shown to make a relaxing &quot; tasty &quot; project .
British inventor sets itself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand@@ motion in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country to open a micro@@ chip so that he can open his door , and even can start his car with a hand@@ ler .

the White House advertising costs cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event which elev@@ ates the American manufacturing last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers , according to the military , which has left the TIM@@ E magazine , up to 24.@@ 000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board was the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American building programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , vice president Mike P@@ ence and Chief officials of the White House made a tour of all 50 states .
in addition to a yacht from Maine , a fire engine from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft truck , this helicopter was made from Mississippi .
the White House &apos;s Military Bureau demanded the presence of helicop@@ ters in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before helicop@@ ters landed on the South La@@ wn , after the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted to be aware , because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 wrote on the eve of the event of his su@@ peri@@ ors , Deputy Defense Secretary of Aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that helicop@@ ters arrived on July 17 at 7 am at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 a.m. , and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 hrs .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be needed for the return flight .
the original flight was found during the event at the helicopter , while security personnel of the unit remained at the plane during the time .
the records provided by the TIM@@ E was not clear whether a second flight was ultimately needed .
the Hatch Act prohi@@ bits federal states to use government property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked whether the event could hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question that we created was whether it was an inf@@ rin@@ gement of the Hatch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you are closed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &quot; Made in America &quot; event was den@@ oted by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .
but official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave a violation of reform of health reform that was underway in the Senate and propag@@ ated efforts to contain@@ ment of government regulations .
the use of the aircraft that is known as Marine One or Air Force One , of politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .
President are oblig@@ ated to use them for the journey .
but its use only for a photo surgery is unusual .
in February , Tr@@ ump resulted in an investigation as the presidential jet in front of the background of his first combat r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and its Twitter account is full of messages that evaluate the use of the presidential jet by its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is thrilled by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the vice @-@ president of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often lead training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn around the U.S. president in the White House with precise cen@@ timet@@ res .
in early July , when Tr@@ ump was at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led 58 practice tours in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was one of the training needs for the month , an official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flo@@ ats for additional 11 hours on this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support com@@ missions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers were not the burden for any of the other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved to issue the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget drawings for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ d of the US Ministry of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D completion of the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
Chronicle of the unity list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of valuation allow@@ ances is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs involved in the annual means . &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , revenues for DO@@ D do not contain personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract .
at that time , the former press officer of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of helicop@@ ters for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present these week things that are produced in America , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I expect hundreds , if not thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most of the Americans we are all proud of helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for so many Americans .
it is , of course , reasonable to empha@@ size . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump with helicopter was inter@@ acting when he entered his round about the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire blowing .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump to Represent@@ atives of Si@@ kor@@ sky spoke to the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

since then , investors have since co @-@ financed investors from the local O@@ MV , together with other European companies , co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic newspaper Nord Stream 2 .
the d@@ ron@@ es is massive .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .

Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is turned into the center of Net@@ fli@@ x into the center
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars killer unveiled , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is still not over yet .
the seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest sheets of the show .
with the third season the DE@@ A has directed her attention to the richest farm in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell .
led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; as a Fortune 500 company &quot; with more state taxation and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodriguez ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Damian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodriguez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Am@@ mann ) command the Mexican compound , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .
in the newly published tra@@ ilers Pedro Pascal returns to Javier Pe@@ ña , the type , the American and Colom@@ bian law en@@ forcement authorities , to support the war against drugs .
new actors are Mati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Sil@@ vest@@ re , Kerry Bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on September 1st .
a back@@ wards : the city introduces 46 kitchen aid
the city organis@@ es the Kit@@ a @-@ noon table again .
with fixed contact partners for the children and one mapping to the team .
in the urban nur@@ series , the clock will be turned back .
on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld will take over food supplies in urban children &apos;s day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Deputy Head of Youth Aid , that is a good news : &quot; we are all very happy . &quot;
cooking is still cooked except house : a cat@@ erer takes this task and supplies fresh @-@ boiled cooled .
in the field of 46 children , the city operates a hot meal in the field of 46 children &apos;s care centres .
over the past day@@ time , 2800 children were seated at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile not only children who are taken care of 45 week@@ days are at noon in the Kit@@ a noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children stay until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 particles of joining service from 1 September kitchen service : they heat up the supplied food , add them around the salad , raw food and fruits , Por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individually , give the food out , clean and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are attributed to a kit@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups @-@ group@@ ed as well as seventh groups - decides about timet@@ able circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen actors now belong to the Kit@@ a @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much stronger , and it is easier to implement educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative , if all members of the society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ s@@ om , the deputy head of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women are in the Council &apos;s elections in the provinces . three women can@@ di@@ ets for the role of vice @-@ president and over 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women can &apos;t be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and believ@@ able if women are unable to participate and included in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the provincial Council and the presidential elections take place on April 5 .
the Taliban publishes threats against a election process , which coinci@@ des with the transition from international fighting operations to an advisory role .
this year , the elections for the first time passed the power peac@@ efully by a democra@@ tically elected government .
Hay@@ s@@ om said that a strong role for women will rein@@ force the democratic success Afghanistan .

G@@ MB concern about investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
one union wants to engage in managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie on long @-@ term commitment to production in their work in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company was silent about the future of investment at the Toll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the work which besides other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea biscuits are produced .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties &apos;s propriet@@ or said that in recent years he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would experience &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company &apos;s Fili@@ pp@@ on@@ ites , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s said to express &quot; concern that funding will not be driven by modernis@@ ation of production lines . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior Organ@@ izer Dre@@ w Duffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can not gain clarity over business needs and investment plans for the future of Toll@@ cross , concerns our members .
generations of families have been working here and labour force concentrated on the local community and the large region Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social discrimination .
therefore , under the perspective of employment , wage and welfare state , and before the background of the Bre@@ xit , the growing living expenses and the chronic production of production , the e@@ ast@@ erly end of Glasgow is ur@@ gently ur@@ gently a bo@@ oming manufacturing res@@ ence with Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ pp@@ on@@ ites at Toll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to this , as we estimate the continuous engagement in employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at Toll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the staff that we are like all the businesses that are working in a extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , constantly check our stores - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our Toll@@ cross location , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the inheritance of Toll@@ cross as a production facility and quite entirely . should our business processes change at the location , employees and trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years before N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the site of La League likes her interest to Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti regret
Paris Saint @-@ Germain won &apos;t leave N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s persecution in its persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar to dis@@ solving his open @-@ air cl@@ ause but have warned Barcelona three years before the world war ?
the sensational approach has ended the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 Club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds .
after completion N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest affordable professional athletes in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500.000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious via the way , as N@@ ey@@ mar has forced its way outside , although a source near the Catal@@ ans approach it insi@@ sts that the club has always been his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 to take care of him .
but has been warned of the soccer world three years ago from the PS@@ G president ?
when Manchester City will be interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players from PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not worried because they let us touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
but if they try to sign one of our players to sign , so this will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , with the Spanish club tuned interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G has made clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona was able to feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um was on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au towards Le@@ ese in the direction of Le@@ ese .
in the area of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him on his lane , so that he had to turn out to the right .
the Tour@@ an driver touch@@ ed the guide plann@@ er .
there was no damage to passenger cars .

according to the accident , it can be well informed that the Merc@@ ed@@ stock driver hadn &apos;t realized the accident .

interview : &quot; cathedral @-@ atzen report by Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the re@@ mn@@ ant Dom@@ spar@@ rows report on the abuse of abuse by Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ used sc@@ andal at the burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows continues to take care of discussions .
Christian Weis@@ sen@@ ator , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are church , &quot; stated after the publication of the German Press Agency , he was expecting the bishop Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI .
it would be very good to see the reputation of the Catholic Church when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their profound regret about their own under@@ ings or her then false assessment of the processes .
on the other hand , the Vatican Council &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; critic@@ ised that during the reporting on violence with &quot; two @-@ level measurement &quot; was measured .
regarding the gri@@ ps in Regensburg , nobody doubts that it would have to be sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds , &quot; but the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hab@@ it to call the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of the everyday experience and is preparing public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis meant an interview with the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; we would like to go on to the Church and that &apos;s a gentle fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
moreover , she pointed out that in their youth , &quot; saw a quite normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; to be ready to get ready to be done . &quot;
they are un@@ fair to use today &apos;s standards on earlier decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse , Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also appeared .
totally in@@ justice , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who translated with R@@ atz@@ inger the &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , &quot; says Hes@@ sia , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the findings of the final report .
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report which was presented by the German B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ant lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the early 1990s , &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 Dom@@ spar@@ rows sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report , it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; summar@@ izing , so that from Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister R. has been used in many cases forms of physical and mental violence .
especially at high E@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality , the punishment for the students also dropped sharply .
in contrast to numerous other certificates , many victims of R. estimated the general humanity by R. and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories are linked to him . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the ab@@ sc@@ andal that Georg R@@ atz@@ inger said it in his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; Incidents of Viol@@ ence to Prot@@ eins , &quot; is a contra@@ dic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
as a result , many students stand out of his &quot; humanity . &quot;
in addition , it appears as ch@@ oline engine and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which was tan@@ gible by the oil , if a dom@@ eter has no top performance .
how do you use this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : when you read the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you must be wonder@@ ing why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is to occur at all .
he has just been eight pages dedicated and he will be acquitted of any sus@@ pic@@ ion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
non @-@ violence at the pre@@ school occurred outside of the sphere of action .
you may cause it to be too late , whether it is too late , or not have taken the first impression taken seriously .
the Dom@@ en@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um on which he worked , was experienced by virtually all those surveyed than - so liter@@ al - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; heaven , &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also introduces him an excellent witness , describes it as &quot; warm hear@@ ty , &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; upright , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; and &quot; understand@@ able , &quot; as extremely good @-@ duty teacher who supplied the boys regularly with cakes , biscuits and bond@@ holders , and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority is compl@@ ained about his perf@@ ection@@ ism and its high emotional qualities , which led even to wo@@ ut@@ ries .
that he did not only kno@@ ck out with chairs and threw the key League on the ground but also ear@@ plugs distributed and too bad guys in the hair and ears , he has already regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for himself .
however , its honorary positions must be said , however , that such educational methods in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , were widely used , with parents as well as teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone was born before 1968 .
I also have experienced this in a world @-@ wide school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um .
compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the ab@@ etting sexual abuse and non @-@ violence on the pre@@ school , the free excav@@ ators are .
you are wonder@@ ing whether it &apos;s not to do with his acquain@@ t@@ ance and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , many media have just over@@ threw him .
on the Bavarian , many people have never understood him , still eager to understand him .
but the truth is : Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s report in every respect !
in the media , in connection with the report , much about the topic of mis@@ use in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows has been reported .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also put a burden in final report or complic@@ ity in respect to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have seen the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never danced with my father or my mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a covered deputy for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was all very embarrass@@ ed to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem with En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they did not even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , certainly not a ch@@ oral teacher who had been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do you assess the Dom@@ spar@@ rows students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student form@@ ulated it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he had had just been thinking ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and could have had the respective perpet@@ rators .
I keep it ... even for real absurd , to accept that it &apos;s counting from him ... be@@ et@@ rable or clear@@ er or rather open , as compared to their parents , Internet guide , trust instruc@@ tors , etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in advance to the affected pupils and / or their environment , could not be confirmed as part of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is talking about every contribut@@ or .
thus , it cannot be accused of having denied him or brought him to the ad .
hence , there is no reason to bring his good name to this contra@@ sting crime , as unfortunately it happened in some cases .
in the media , there was a lot of &quot; violent eat &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of having been alleged in the report .
do he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and bl@@ ended to a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but exactly that is a mis@@ use of the report .
there is always separate : between pre @-@ school and high school of the Dom@@ spar@@ rows , between sexual abuse and non @-@ violence and , let &apos;s say , other pre@@ destined .
it has also been dealt with inci@@ dents of the period since 1945 , so also for four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a choir director of the cathedral .
the whole aw@@ ful test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which the boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers have been schi@@ z@@ ily and mal@@ icious , and un@@ ab@@ rup@@ tible , took place all of them at school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have ruled .
but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only to face when they were already at the top of the cathedral .
on him , like most witnesses , the subject &quot; Pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ u .
one was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise of paradise . &quot;
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ ous violence .
and that also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report conclu@@ des that &quot; many victims of R. estimated the general humanity by R. and therefore in many cases even positive memories will connect with him . &quot;
thus , at the most , the accus@@ ation remains to be taken away .
however , despite all efforts , the report could define only two periods in which it was reported by the states at the Pre@@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and from the predec@@ essors at a school where he had not worked and responsible , ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 .
en@@ oss Georg R@@ atz@@ inger systematically ri@@ gor@@ ously the ears ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ en@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um , which was even re@@ produced by the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he demonstrates that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the test for testing will continue to be prac@@ tised &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in view of the risk of negative pres@@ sur@@ ization , he received urgent consent .
that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as an investig@@ ator , in Bavaria long ago .
before that , they occurred in a legal grey zone , as each of us still knows .
it was difficult for him to estimate where those affected may be exagger@@ ated or dramatic and where really the permissible limit was exceeded .
but one can &apos;t say , he would have always looked away .
that is just not true .
only in 1980 , the test sentence was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said that it was un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards on that time .
how do you see it ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we speak as histori@@ ans of &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger to evaluate the past today &apos;s moral standards .
the princ@@ ess has quite right here .
but this is of course not for sexual abuse , who was ab@@ stain@@ ed at all times , and not for what was broken in the pre@@ school of ad@@ jun@@ ctions and violence against innocent children &apos;s soul , that goes far beyond that .
that &apos;s all terrible and I &apos;m happy that it will finally be recorded .
but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all this had nothing to do with him .
its funds for discipl@@ ines and punishment , i.e. ear plugs and ears , were widely used in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then banned , he also stri@@ pped himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is the picture of his time George R@@ atz@@ inger came back in our talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
was the subject of Prü@@ fer Pen@@ alty for the Language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells of his perspective , as the Dom@@ spar@@ rows played only a minor part .
nevertheless , I don &apos;t forget that he was a strict regim@@ ent there .
but this must also be said : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the un@@ conditional discipline , it would be hardly possible to form a institution of world tran@@ ches , true cultural ambassador in Europe and its musical tradition , which went straight twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with Kek@@ sen and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one doesn &apos;t make any big singer now and before every success , right in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ persu@@ asion .
what a man do you have experienced George R@@ atz@@ inger in talks about her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and always seen as wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic , deep believing and hear@@ ty people , of whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could only do a fly a fly somewhat .
I am regularly updated with how many former Dom@@ spar@@ rows are still in contact with him today , 23 years after his embar@@ go , visit him regularly - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .
those who don &apos;t forgive him until today , that he once was strict to them , so are definitely in the minority .
most Dom@@ spar@@ rows are grateful to him today that he en@@ riches their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he was always a good , pat@@ ern@@ al teacher - a str@@ ingent father , certainly that may be - but still a lov@@ able respect to which they still look up and to rever@@ t them today .
and please , once more clearly : everything you acc@@ uses to him are educational methods that were at the time at the time .
we can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because it is promin@@ ently and a more prominent brother to make a median scap@@ eg@@ o@@ at .
there is the bad intention behind it , just too obvious .
for the report , which was just released , was dischar@@ ged .
now the annex@@ ed area , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great services and without the outside of Bay@@ erns , and perhaps of Germany would probably know no one who would have known the dom@@ es of dom@@ es in peace , finally in peace .
