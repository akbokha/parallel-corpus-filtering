<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view to the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irish institution where young people are supposed to meet.</seg>
<seg id="3">A tomb where the tunnel is dug up for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardener grabbed the ingenious basis of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying when maps are not currently present.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everyone knows, who already had to get exciting, because the auto-Navi takes place a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the geoportas Bayern of the state government, are all other than currently - but therefore very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compare it with current online-cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is then clear how towns and municipalities have changed in the area of Munich's area since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern Atlas is a Flickr carpet, which is not the same as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the great coverage map, cities and communities were given more detailed maps, so-called Urals leaves.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were written according to the Bavarian surveying administration between 1810 and 1864 and from the first surveying of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your Client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French Armed Forces occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographical survey of Bayerns on behalf of course - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops returned to the Lunéville peace treaty of February 9, 1801, it was today's neighbours who created the idea of a wide-nationwide regional card.</seg>
<seg id="18">KurfürstMax IV. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thereby the Bavarian surveying.</seg>
<seg id="19">The certificate for Munich dates from 1856 and is like all others found on the Bavarian Library's website.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of the capital / today is the most impressive example of the country's capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is undersendling, which is still relatively isolated in the 1856 map.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. 1877, in the Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling lies in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated in 1856 along the today Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the insurrection of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where the Westpark remains, you can see nothing but fields - at the first glance: in execution zooming a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwriting numbered pieces from the so-called "Urals," derived from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots are not shown there today no farmers" "" "but small husbandmen in the plant" "" "Land in Sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">Theresienwiese, since 1810 event of the Oktoberfest, has actually been a meadow in the 19th century, and there was no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the judging sheet, one reads not only the street name "at the host name" at the Gasteig "or from the hill" At the lude "- but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt. "</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here on the Auerfeldstraße one once opened people with insets.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 1858 / 59, the Munich circle-Irrenanstalt "was created on the Auer Lüth.</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard directed the establishment of a psychiatrist who was promoted to King Ludwig II's death in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was advanced for his time and ended, for example, the chains of the so-called Irren.</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he instructed the staff to tackle violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients had been first place, later extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity could no longer be sufficient - the foundation for the construction of the Kreisirpenitentiary in the hair of 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">There has been the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists in Germany since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the area of the former Auer Anstalt, teenagers will meet in Munich Salesianum now.</seg>
<seg id="41">The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth house with training courses.</seg>
<seg id="42">The football field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015 they established the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" - in an architectural reference to the origin of the Irrenanstalt who had been destroyed during the World War II bombing.</seg>
<seg id="44">The marienplatz was in 1856 as "main place," the department of the department was named "Kaufinger alley."</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War carried out a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allies destroyed many holes in the city in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English institute, small business houses and a Gruftkapelle from the Middle Ages were once alive at the Marienhof, where these days are working on the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn family.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider glider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group Announces Travel to Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the promotion of Farmers made a warning for colored people, who are travelling due to discriminatory politics and racist attacks by the state to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "the NAACP Travel Advisory Advisory for the Federal State of Missouri, who, until 28 August 2017, urges afro-American travellers, visitors and missourians, where a series of fragile, racial-based accusations occur in recent times throughout the state and indicated here," "" "says the Group's opinion." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it difficult to win discrimination against minorities, as well as the law enforcement agencies of the state, which aim incomparably to minorities, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have injuries to civil rights that happen to humans.</seg>
<seg id="55">They will stick together because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear discomfort in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">The Group identified incidents of the racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances of the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the journey through the State, and was accused by the police of Missouri by a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also refers to a recently published report by the Office of Missouri Office, which is shown that black drivers in the state will be held 75 percent more frequently than white.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and informed their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "" "Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people have to be willing to bring it to the cowardess or the relatives, that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri posted 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the Order of Hasselt Report from the FBI, which entered the state in terms of number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri Act which would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued itineraries for Texas and Arizona, having agreed to commit local law enforcement agencies to relieve people because of immigration rules, which will contribute to the ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel tips are usually issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs to other countries, but at the last time stakeholders have used the measure of reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Weightly Project is elemental</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fishbacher Weidecaun project is a successful project and continued in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Parliamentary Group Peter White and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischerhaacher CDU-outskirts met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially made insights into his operation, with 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows, and as well as many young animals and houses in five apartments.</seg>

<seg id="85">The open surface area is 40 hectares, which must not be upgraded by at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total costs of 71 500 Euro, half of the total cost was promoted by leader, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fishbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Consequently, the farmers had to invest 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained swivel.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you do not make a really good job, without farmers and landlords." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="96">The open surface area is equivalent to 35 hectares, representing a total cost of more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred anymore?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking part of the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The most secure character of a regime change is when they start to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans estimate these as well as any other - hence the assortment of Saddam Hussein's assortment on the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump-regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta by CNN concerning the proposals from the preoccupying forces of the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of owners possessions and Liberty-Imitators would have synched him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he grabbed their importance, and in particular the importance that it was attributed to, as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta complained: "I don't want to go into a full thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty... a symbol of American freedom that enlightened the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you refer to, was later added and not part of the original statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is factual right, but as he formulated it, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It's about the contemporary resonance on the upset words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your arms, your arms, and the furious waste of your rich coastal waters."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "eleventh apostasy" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made sure that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural meditation: it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after her death at the base - knew very well that they did a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicans by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn classical display.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no more abstract - she received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And there is a completely different name: mother of the Exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist Coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, the people wanted to change this long before.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty came to no one, but rather an early neoconservative that the American flame goes into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty continues.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not to light the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh found here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is quite and even a matter of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was in it to see them as they were seen from the exhaustible, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the ships of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the true sense that the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and have a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue says to them the words of hope, and of the will they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is of course not the perspective, the Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Her torch shall not cause the way, but hatred, who is the only source of power, ignite.</seg>

<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Their surrender "speech was incredible," says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, no matter whether they were Scottish or where ever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>

<seg id="151">"that is so special to be team capitals in it, so it was a great honour within the other members of the team, but to know that my team-mates have voted for me and chosen me, makes it something special for me," added them.</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously I'm very proud of all the Schotts that belong to the team.</seg>

<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>

<seg id="160">Block from critics on Facebook: do not strike your public office if you don't wear the heating of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington but it did not long until the newspapers beat him because of all, from the Domestic Policy up to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He looked at the critique, certainly.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he didn't put his critics silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech may be taken away - and, stupid and mute, as sheep for the slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Maryland Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more than Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 persons and deleted their opinion on its official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union complained to him in the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolvol, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is just Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the nation's 50 governors.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary agent to connect with his voters to debacle his hair-loose head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore the blockage of people that come to the side of the Governors - which is a public forum, which is called officially called and of employees who are paid with public tax-Dollars - unnecessarily and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the Governor and argued that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too easy to use the image of trunks or chambers, or water-filled people, which swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The Post spoke with some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said their comments respectfully, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post office and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>

<seg id="188">What the employee of the Governor's "concentrated spam attack," would others be called "intercession."</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in previous time when you have done the same that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical conductors to collect and burn demonstrators and bring protesters to silence and to silence.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials to criticise that he has criticised Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is proclaim from Twitter users who were blocked by Twitter feeds.</seg>

<seg id="197">It should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers varied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous correspondence in 1776 and 1800.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery-area will be invited to the old cemetery-area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 o'clock.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether his idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historic St. Hilarius plant a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth Benefiz-Serenade can be enchanted from this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the place have made friends and sponsors of tumors for their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasized: "it is a unique legend."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267, St. Hilariuskapelle was mentioned for the first time in the Württembergischer jungle church: count Hermann of Sulz sold "the mountain with the sacred parish church on Tumors with the Vogtei" on Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">The word, according to the certificate, stood on the Tumlinger mountain except the rusty parish church beside the rusty parish church, which belonged to the Church or the patron, and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">So people also lived there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamite Freudenstadt of 1858, it was beside the Lower village and the Upper Village that today are still visible in the town of Tumlingen, the "Mountain" of the third, the city centre of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the period around 1600, these historical circumstances are undergoing.</seg>
<seg id="476">The patron was originated from the early medieval owner.</seg>
<seg id="477">A Lord that built a church, and occupied with a priest, continued the owner of this church, and was able to inherit these suitcases.</seg>
<seg id="478">This was the right to use a pastor, or to suggest a bishop of a pastor.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two torn at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell, then in 1692, had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) window frames were stolen and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was indignant.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as a firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to overthrow in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius graveyard served as the last resting place for the dead from hearing aids.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariuskirche was broken off.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the cherries had to stand.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year 1834, a storm sank the steeple storm and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only today's existing Turmzwerg stayed as a witness of the 750 years old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem cultivates the "creative pensioner" as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">As organisers invite friends and promoter tumors on Sunday, July 16, at the sixth serenade to the old cemetery for St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the Kepler grammar of Kepler's grammar school and with worries by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">The town of Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 15.30 a.m.</seg>
<seg id="499">On the occasion of the serenade, a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows down to the forest," the organizers put out the fantastic views.</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade only takes place in dry weather.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others tried and have failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the information flow to President Trump - including reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">When John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met his first day of working with leading employees, he introduced a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wants to repair: poor information that will fall into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letters - because President would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys Diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to count trump by monitor his meditation.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship to television is enough for decades - and now, where he is at the White House, his television advertisement is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "when candidate Trump was annoyed because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs," "" "said the former election campaign Sam Nunberg in February against POLITICO." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keep Trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaign officials, to ensure that his personal media consumption has a constant praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we do not know - that Trumps tweets would contain any more ignition.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We'll probably never learn anything about tweets, the trump not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">When his associates gave it a few times, trouble away from him, then their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently able to prevent drump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem exists, that people in a White House, which are competing with competing parties, will always try to present their own agenda by promoting trump material which may potentially have their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of consultants, president of strategic reasons desperate information.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former trump-civil servants say that Trump may react to negative press sections, especially those with humiliating leaks and that he can find out how these originate from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly that happened at the end of February, when someone accused a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy Chief of Staff of Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a cluster of Lecks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson had been banished to Twitter permanently from Twitter or that he has no specific evidence, or that he expressed false allegations in the past and revoke them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to question people on Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">"" "Goldmaker added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter," "" "tried to implement a system to manage the paper kram and document the trump." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did this work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to prove more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still in influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchangeable factors make the Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1488">A couple of weeks ago, the Washington Post wrote a couple of weeks ago, that the Special Rump is personally put into the centre and undergo the accusation whether the President in the course of the affair may have implied the judiciary.</seg>

<seg id="1526">After the opinion of many researchers, it can be related to global warming.</seg>

<seg id="1534">In addition, the iron plate stand under tension and can be broken down, if at a key station a piece break down.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelleis and Eisberg increases the sea level not because they swim on the water and melt the ice as much water as it comes after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of Schelfeises leads to the glaciers flow directly into the sea as well as much faster than before.</seg>

<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Scheldermal is the fourth largest city of Antarctica following an area of almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>

<seg id="1564">This is already listening to a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems, which one didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and provide more attractive terms.</seg>

<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter peoples, president of the CDU, goes out with his party even beyond the joint request.</seg>

<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a hydromonoxide poisoning in a vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="1682">The case referred to national attention, after Carters told text messages that she had encouraged her to finish his life.</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hanging on, spring from a building, make yourself yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was with his family on holiday.</seg>

<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, the expert of the agricultural research institute, CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant was exposed to the effects of climate change, which grew much less in the spring and much more in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the life of lavender.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat of threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly magazine Riodoce usually meet in Wednesdays to review their plans for the most recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt civil servants and unaudible drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children into office, who were the aim of a attack with grenades in 2009, or at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Safety experts have written three words on a plaque on the front of the room: opponents, Neutrale, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters, names for every column - no evidence is necessary to submit perceptions and abdominal pain.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the secret list of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There are no rest of violence, while in all the country the bodies are frequent: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto passed his office in December 2012. 589 have been standing by attacks and threats from federal protection and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is the editors and their inspirator of Riodoce, co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live and journalist in Mexico," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence will be deeply felt, although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo by Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, bear T-shirts, who show his smiling face with glasses or its typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared subjects, the trauma, its nightmares, sleeplessness, Paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Even though it was built by the Prosecutor's Office in 2010, it has led only two criminal proceedings according to the committee, according to the Committee to protect journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of Morden, who are associated with drug dealers and organisational crimes each year, the killers of journalists are rarely placed on trial.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce they still consist to treat the violence of Sinaloa while they are intrisostal, and although the terrain is still stricter.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, meeting the discussion of security of security, Ibarra says.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the Why, we suspend all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks, before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and was shot for 12 times, probably because of the name of the paper - which was translated with "Twelfth River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left one woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors are inclined to wander in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez, there is practically nothing in silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans was arrested last year and the extradition of the United States in January was Sinaloa to become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, since rival factions are struggling to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of, two-story mouths that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "rest" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work is Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, who violates guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of the rival factions in war with Guzmans sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may be annoyed the sons, presumed gangmembers bought every copy of the output when it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was in it, Valdez not to force her, after the withdrawal of a other newspaper that had published the same story, to leave the country to his own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues see that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporters for the Noroeste in 2003 when he co-operated with five colleagues to the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 U.S. dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run journalism without stepping on the poison-poison problem," Bojorquez said.</seg>
<seg id="1847">With time, the newspaper served a reputation for courageous and honest coverage, and sales and advertising.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved it to publish hard treading examinations without fear of censorship, and the readers were intrigued by a publication that they could read stories that nobody else could be treated.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors Cabot Award" for their reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists on the persecution of the Mexican drug history, wherever it led them.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily, that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue," he said at the time of the CPJ award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drugs in Sinaloa" "" "is a way of life," "" "he said in an interview with Romeiviento TV last October." ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you have to take up the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you are playing dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what did you do with so many things... why did you not say what went on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team measures Valdez, the fun-bird who could curse like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice was, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and there always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for the routine his calamity?</seg>
<seg id="1861">Her death also forced her to ask her own assumptions about how they can do their work best and to stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it, when you talk to their wives, their children, their clean shops, their home runways, to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not permitted," Bojorquez said.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-rise and self-keeping.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">When it smells untrue, stay away.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, "said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that" smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing with Javier is happening. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, in Sinaloa are no longer - just like in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous blend of lucrative smugs, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Riodoce gathered for security training, suddenly there were no mobiles allowed. days earlier, Spyware, who is sold exclusively to governments, to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">The outside sought two policemen from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-class district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in joke, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of policemen who described the governor himself as untrusted.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It has been months since the reporter went into the mountain landscape, where the drug charges de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce worked on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the murder of the brother of Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to state spending, focused on the home town of the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the State Prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped, or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public notes that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who owned the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled almost the century all political plains.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Several PRI governors were accused of being accused of highly charged cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman departed a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, readers would have seen the column by Valdez as the best informational source about the kidnapping.</seg>

<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">The Valdez office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers that are protesting against the murders of journalists, because the staff had become something they would never expect: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez lamented a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist for the Office of the State Security Office.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the Western State of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists gathered more strongly in the country by organizing the SOS Press "SOS Press" organized in organised protests.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On this day, the director Bojorquez is gone to Washington and is trying to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with governor of Sinaloa, on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to exterminate journalists and destroy them because they have said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has therefore asked that she is again classified by the government because she is concerned, her anger has injured her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez has repeatedly mentioned that journalists in Mexico organised by organised crime, involved in government officials and an equal company. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug professionals, but also on the command of politicians and security forces which led to organised crime under a ceiling.</seg>

<seg id="1937">Researchers found that this plant eaters, although it is covered with a armor, and resembles a converting tanks, probably threatened by meat-send dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage, to hide in front of predators, and used a parachuting technique, which is also known as antidelling, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This could have been allowed to mix himself better in its surroundings and to avoid their enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature made from the Nodosaurier family has made headlines in May and is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers now studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one from a team that spent more than 7,000 hours in order to expose it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and the form of shed and armaments over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter shading, a widespread defence method in animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the preventer is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta is far above the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that the dinosaurs was chased out of sufficient pressure due to carnivorous dinosaurs, the evolution of the contamination of the confrontation was favourable to survival as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of contemporary animals that put the counter shading - think of deer, zebras or shingles - are much smaller and vulnerable as prey, which signals that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behavior on a massive, strong armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs must have been the chalk time," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs was bay.</seg>

<seg id="1957">This includes Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tonnes heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists who appear their latest findings in current journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was disposed after death in the sea and fumified in mud.</seg>

<seg id="1998">"comfort check-in" calls the rail traffic evaluation without Schaffner.</seg>
<seg id="1999">To use this, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to booked an online ticket - which is already the most passengers already anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It is also necessary to have purchased the DB navigator app, which is the most convenient type of the ticket booking.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And lastly, you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The "comfort check-in" works like this: one goes on the train, calling his ticket to "My tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2004">For the test clients then a button on electronic recovery is released.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train drivers get a message to their mobile devices that Fahrgast X is on the train and is used for the bench seat.</seg>
<seg id="2006">If the train station is at number Y, he knows that a passenger is already being placed on the online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, continue to keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which is to take advantage of the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"who likes to travel without a ticket control through our migratory personnel, check out in the DB Navigator.</seg>
<seg id="2010">This allows the passengers to design their travel time in train personal, "says Michael Peterson, Marketing Management of DB Ferncorrespondence.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Second Plus: "and our staff have more time than today to go to individual customer needs."</seg>
<seg id="2012">Those who often travel, know that next to delay and passports trains the ticket controls belong to the biggest medical devices.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often, in any case, one of the fellow travelers does not need all the documents you need for the devaluation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or identity card is missing, or a document that you need to show.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train drivers and driving pleasure, which leads to bad mood in the evenings or large-room and delays in control of your own tickets and the Schaffner at the end time takes care of the other concern.</seg>

<seg id="2060">"" "a question came from Ferrell:" "" "do you want to document it or try to find a story that you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This Skepsis was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan recently declared in an interview: "we heard that people who were born in Ferguson and raised their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is known for its activism around Todestract occupants.</seg>

<seg id="2068">As a result, documents show "Whose Streets?" a surprising personal aspects of Ferrells lives, as she loves and marries her woman.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalahn": TV readers discuss bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit-gallery moves the people, although it is not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south of the pedestrian zone has been unfolded since the first presentation of 2009 the population in proponents and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold the subject hardly takes one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">On our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg," the topic will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one at the Bit Gallery say: "this would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be real class" (Nicole Schauest), comes from the other side: "does not need a man" (Siggi Bate) or quite simple: "megalms!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While proponents are building that a gallery draws more customers into the city, of which the other businesses benefit from, fear the enemies, that the pedestrian zone should be bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery will be planned on the premises in which the farmers market stands, in which 13 direct marketing will offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of the construction work will be at the end.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery movers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and the Beda place with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Room: "we have been selling almost weekly in the rustic market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the landlords are always happy again.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We discovered the butcher's butcher for us too.</seg>

<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>

<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what shopping branches in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find this superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One sees how many shoppers are empty here - some since months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even one regular weekly market here, it is even more important that at least the market stands at least remains.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the goods offered there is fresh, mostly offered by producers and is obscless expensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, loads shops in a shopping center will only be rented by bigger companies, because the local players are often not portable.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special business is almost no longer and what is left over, will probably disappear as well. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall fits me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Especially: where is the farmers market riding during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even if the bit-gallery actually comes to some point.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it already make the ghost bit Gallery previously to distribute all shops from Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it simply won't work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And an shopping center that is empty, no one needs.</seg>
<seg id="2121">In my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But there is no place for a farmers market, thanks to the madness of many - how I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg no more space.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the farmers' market is broken, a piece of culture will vanish. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A perfect resemblance: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the center of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown, which are almost immeasurable - that hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tucker and Haarlem by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth where the former secret service analyst had used a 35-year sentence after she publicly laid diplomatic records on the website WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance (A suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg whose discipline was transformed into technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transformer and landmark report whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg created by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA that could be extracted from Manning and created out of 30 portraits, if any intellectual comment does not only look at the formability of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning who was born in Bradley Edward II, but has been openly pronounced on identification as a woman, was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">By the prison, their image was suppressed, so very that there was only one photo - a grain, black-white selfie, sitting in a driver sitting at a driver seat and a platinum-blonde Persian carries - with whom she was associated with.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigars and chewing gum, and extracted the DNA from the waste to create a picture of how these people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"" "" "" "they led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "" "Dewey-Hagborg explained in a press preview of the new exhibition." ""</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at this time and she could not be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated Muse were unequal together, that over two years later, several letters broke out in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created one of Shoili Kanungo Illustrierte Comic "Suppose Images," which would translate a future in which the President Chelseas would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released, Manning became the release of seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome way of happy communions.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There are also now at the opening of the exhibition there is something deep and Starkes, since Donald Trump introduces a war against informants from the governmental camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweaked ways, which he should fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange timing of all these things, she said that things happen from a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a laying on the wall of the gallery, Manning signed with her oversized signature (the "i" in her family name) is an end of the "automatic fragmentation, whose basis is gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On opposite wall is the mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousanding of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show the inclusion of the 200 characters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific Lexicon of the artist), as astonishingly similar, at least in biological terms, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"" "" "" "what we hope to take away, is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective they are," "" "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also visible." ""</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic book.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning, as she emerges with a release of hands in the United States, such as King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they chill your speech, then they have won," it means.</seg>

<seg id="2154">Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - as it was supposed to be taken out in the comic book - but if they should do it, then it will be greeted in the middle of the room of the masks made from their own genomic simulators, which summarises like hordes of protesters.</seg>

<seg id="2211">"they now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for the persecution of their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools is used to measure employees.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel at Glint in the three years.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap polls and polls of certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company, which shows a glance, which units have the most complaints and which managers have low-use results - so you can pursue, why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture, you do not have to be the next Uber, who has been involved in Skandals, since then a former employee describes a blog post which describes a environment of insults, with the ones who have spoken.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as Glint, this desire is for an overview of a lucrative business possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2216">Global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion value by 2020 according to the Financial Technical website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent heart behaviour and recognise a rising interest and activity in early this year, amidst the Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convert almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">As Glint, Convert makes company tailor-made "puls-" surveys, confidential answers to real time and view the heat-maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline with which employees can report evil behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the chief executive guide is involved, complaints are directly to the board of directors.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the public opinion has recorded the regulations," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convert." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that his employees were badly treated or behave ethethically, it may experience costly consequences by consumers' boycott, employee fluence and passages, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has used Convercent for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures, and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Earlier, if an employee would have to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company headquarters, a formal complaint and hope that it was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a timidable and uncomfortable experience, James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said, there was no good opportunity to pursue the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Well, since the company converts Convercent, problems that were previously were hiding in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or inquicker practitioners are identified and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into experience with employment," "" "said Vitrano who leads the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders in employment legal disputes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Company began to take ethics, values and employees working in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen broke up for ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media" "" "came to their right," "" "they realized that they could not prevent their dirty work online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor the ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent provide your software as a service, and the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that finds the approval of venture capital investors who support both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convert $10 million for funding in February of firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing up the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitters secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its entire financing to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">This investment is hardly surprising, in view of the connected nature of enterprises, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only wagers.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you will give your time a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"" "" "" "if the people are happy to be in a company that they have heard their voices, and that the work that you do is worthwhile, then they feel more strongly committed to make this company successful," "" "said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which is used as well as Glint." ""</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors get Renders if their portfolio companies run smoothly. companies run fine if employees are employed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics-tools promise third-party promise, commitment and deployment of employees, it is no wonder that you can find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data about employee involvement according to experts in the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data are useless when the company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks staff after your feedback, it may have a expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change is not fast enough, or at all, this can motivate disappointments and employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen the company very much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you do not follow employees," "" "Do you really hear me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about that?</seg>
<seg id="2252">And if you don't care about why should I? "</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now runs monthly employee polls, was able to lead action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, so errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after the collector's feedback from frustrated employees she was able to re-organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Among Ruby Tuesday, the company will always get new insights into the staff, and it hopes that for a long term, this leads to a better binding of workers in a sector, which is well-known for high sales.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"" "" "" "if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose the people," "" "said Vitrano." ""</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was visible in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-he and 1980-er years.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his cozy seat in the Oent River Valley in Kent and is now the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mopolitan Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>

<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England 'spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scotney. Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book written by Rhodes, which is based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected.</seg>

<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days to study the Victorian 'New' castle to study the archives and to study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the monotted hyena heads around the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trenches.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He immigrated through the grounds and ruins of the old castle, and spoke with landscaping, gardeners, and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then, he drank "Whiskey and began to write."</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust was only given the full access to 2006 when the last I am, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>

<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to enter the wider base in the English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man that leaves the newly built castle to join the farmer's estate of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a riot that occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book with the title 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', Rhodes.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry about</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought that it cannot be crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking up their ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eyepiece of the robot, its shape of the nipple and type of finger nails.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people are making fun, but the companies deliver lots of it, and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr Sharkey for the release of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen have developed from their inflatable partners to robots using a silicone skin that feels warm - consciously or human reactions that are achieved through artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can adjust his robot according to his beliefs" "" "and choose everything from the eye color of the robot via the shape of nipples to type or color of his finger nails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">But there will be more worrying as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepan-wife progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have developed to robots using a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot allows for example to customize its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they are appealing, such as relentness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still the True Companion developed by True Companion and called "Frigid Farrah" with preprogrammed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah" which conveys the impression of relternity and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible," warms the site of true Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, she also has its moods - quite like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">It can be tired, fixed on conversation or it can be "in mood."</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many worrying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they can replace real human relationships - but the subduous female properties that admits a step on Frigid (means here: residenying) Farrah is worrisome a most disturbing one.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website true-true Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men do not have Roxxxy?" it's on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toys.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and increased refinement indicate something dark and deeper into our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjection as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men of course will not stop sex robots, and while FRR remember their rising popularity, they remain preliminary at the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what is leakened out of the boundary zones, in terms of the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting, until the free market is given to them.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain surge that these highly developed sex robots are endangered in a time, in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House, who has moasted women sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most awesome aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') are not the graphical images, the swallowed body and the extinct eyes, but how realistic this vision appears.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots has a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with Pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Her inheritance is that they feel human feeling that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, at the point when it comes to their "personalities" there is no real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">You can't separate or go away from their companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background background, nothing that could disturb on independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total subjugation.</seg>

<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney to the itome of a healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a Binsenator of the Trump-era that the political spades, which have polarized US voters, have also divided families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving day, there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of trump-selectable relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all allegedly committed ourselves to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power trumps, families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-left poet, who lives in Chicago and has long been visiting New York for a long time with the republicans.</seg>
<seg id="2431">They reminded me that unity can have an enormous effect against a common enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone knows whom she knows, including the republican transformation, with whom she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">In order to meet the dining table it's certainly a good thing, but it falls in another context that this also brings significant risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The Left was strengthened by trump, but the effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and "trump" we refer to the gruselly possibility that we will no longer reject our bib of a day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, a still frightening long-term scenario, in which Trump Republicans of the right wing "normalized," which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as the epitome of failure.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself nowadays from an active nostalgia to Mitt Romney's strange version of crazy version - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return) - both in comparison to Trump is indeed a very mild crime.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When drump passes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be only spiritually healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin in the city was, we brought our children to carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the Carusel in Central Park, and the top three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are cracking and the animals are turning to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climatic music conveys this curious way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappointing: the views of high buildings are old, the Skylines become familiar to provide much excitement, and the reality of the city will not meet the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not all over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the subject-pub ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not counting - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience, as here two two-year-old, one 11-year-old and two women can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">When I was able to evaluate the carousel, I had given him the full score, but fortunately nobody was asked.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I was able to pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it's the same, plus the option to buy the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the shop.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This does not only lead to a slowdown of what should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality to a situation in which no need is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store stood guilty, while I wearied the experience to rich my credit card with five stars.</seg>

<seg id="2452">Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal against the prosecutors of the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of the Valentine's morning of 2013, by sending them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he had his girlfriend for a night intruder, who hidden himself in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors announced their intention to appeal against the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appell, of which they say they were too opaque.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The National prosecution authority said that it will be issued by the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the objection can be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius is at risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years when the prosecutors are successful.</seg>

<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, goes into retirement in the upcoming year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The job is already written - suitable candidates are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">For 31 years, Wackers has been a city master.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work makes it still great fun, as it conveys in press report.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports varied, but also demanding tasks that wait for his successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, it amazes him that so far there is no application to fulfill the requirement profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the next time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">Thus, - under the lease of regular termination periods - is still enough time for a work.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study asserts exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could relieve symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States in the United States, causing magnites and paralysis, recurring or bloody attacks, weight loss and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the affected are usually lost, meat and dairy products found to avoid their symptoms, researchers at the Washingtoner University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestine vanishes to make sure that damaging microbes that hide in eating, not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are inherent to dissolving inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">When equilibrium is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel process.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell in mice was found that a certain bacterium is in their innards.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the blocks of proteins - to resolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus terteri - which is a normal part of the intestines microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of tryptophan-rich nutrition tolerates, less flammable intestinal milieus, if the same system also helps people work.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan undertook a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance as they found out that a group of female mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe that had not been separated, but had not had this.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They presumed that the difference between the intestinal microbible of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, who normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The hereditary mice were detected DNA sequenced and there were six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells, but without them in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were reared in a sterile environment, so that they had not been a intestinal microbiome, and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria reacted to the immune system, the researchers abandoned L. reuteri in a liquid and then led little amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to tolerate tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When active component has been cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan-metabolism known as the Indol-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of such cells climbed by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerant-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect us in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan by L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as with mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probable that we want to promote because these cells control infections on the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>

<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain won't leave Neymar's persecution in its persecution of Neymar to dissolving his open-air clause but have warned Barcelona three years before the world war?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has ended the transfer window in summer, because the Ligue 1 Club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After completion Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest affordable professional athletes in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500.000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is furious via the way, as Neymar has forced its way outside, although a source near the Catalans approach it insists that the club has always been his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 to take care of him.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But has been warned of the soccer world three years ago from the PSG president?</seg>

<seg id="2871">"" "" "" "I'm not worried because they let us touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," "" "said Al-Kheli." ""</seg>
<seg id="2872">"we respect all the clubs.</seg>
<seg id="2873">But if they try to sign one of our players to sign, so this will have consequences. "</seg>
<seg id="2874">Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line, with the Spanish club tuned interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.</seg>
<seg id="2875">PSG has made clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances, and Barcelona was able to feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for Neymar.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "cathedral-atzen report by Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The remnant Domsparrows report on the abuse of abuse by Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the misused scandal at the burger Domsparrows continues to take care of discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weissenator, spokesman of the reform movement "We are church," stated after the publication of the German Press Agency, he was expecting the bishop Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be very good to see the reputation of the Catholic Church when Müller and Ratzinger would express their profound regret about their own underings or her then false assessment of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">On the other hand, the Vatican Council "Osservatore Romano" criticised that during the reporting on violence with "two-level measurement" was measured.</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the grips in Regensburg, nobody doubts that it would have to be shameful and shameful deeds, "but the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit to call the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of the everyday experience and is preparing public opinion to keep it normal," "" "Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Also Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis meant an interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we would like to go on to the Church and that's a gentle frescoes."</seg>
<seg id="2898">Moreover, she pointed out that in their youth, "saw a quite normal pedagogical means" to be ready to get ready to be done. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are unfair to use today's standards on earlier decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger also appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Totally injustice, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who translated with Ratzinger the "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take Georg Ratzinger into protection," says Hessia, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the findings of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report which was presented by the German Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenant lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domsparrows were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s, "victims of overprint, 67 Domsparrows sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it is called Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "summarizing, so that from Domenellmeister R. has been used in many cases forms of physical and mental violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially at high Emotionality, the punishment for the students also dropped sharply.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In contrast to numerous other certificates, many victims of R. estimated the general humanity by R. and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories are linked to him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abscandal that Georg Ratzinger said it in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "Incidents of Violence to Proteins," is a contradictory picture of Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">As a result, many students stand out of his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">In addition, it appears as choline engine and perfectionist, which was tangible by the oil, if a dometer has no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you use this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: when you read the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you must be wondering why the name Georg Ratzinger is to occur at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just been eight pages dedicated and he will be acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Non-violence at the preschool occurred outside of the sphere of action.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You may cause it to be too late, whether it is too late, or not have taken the first impression taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domenatzengymnasium on which he worked, was experienced by virtually all those surveyed than - so literal - "salvation," "heaven," and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">The vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also introduces him an excellent witness, describes it as "warm hearty," "said," "upright," "competent," and "understandable," as extremely good-duty teacher who supplied the boys regularly with cakes, biscuits and bondholders, and "always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority is complained about his perfectionism and its high emotional qualities, which led even to woutries.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only knock out with chairs and threw the key League on the ground but also earplugs distributed and too bad guys in the hair and ears, he has already regretted and apologized for himself.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, its honorary positions must be said, however, that such educational methods in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, were widely used, with parents as well as teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also have experienced this in a world-wide school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the abetting sexual abuse and non-violence on the preschool, the free excavators are.</seg>
<seg id="2926">You are wondering whether it's not to do with his acquaintance and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, many media have just overthrew him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">On the Bavarian, many people have never understood him, still eager to understand him.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: Georg Ratzinger's report in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report, much about the topic of misuse in the Regensburger Domsparrows has been reported.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger also put a burden in final report or complicity in respect to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have seen the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never danced with my father or my mother about it," "" "said a covered deputy for the others," "" "I was all very embarrassed to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with Enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even trust parents and siblings, certainly not a choral teacher who had been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do you assess the Domsparrows students Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he had had just been thinking (Georg Ratzinger) and could have had the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I keep it... even for real absurd, to accept that it's counting from him... beetrable or clearer or rather open, as compared to their parents, Internet guide, trust instructors, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "so the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that in advance to the affected pupils and / or their environment, could not be confirmed as part of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is talking about every contributor.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus, it cannot be accused of having denied him or brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Hence, there is no reason to bring his good name to this contrasting crime, as unfortunately it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media, there was a lot of "violent eat" at the Regensburger Domsparrows.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of having been alleged in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and blended to a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But exactly that is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is always separate: between pre-school and high school of the Domsparrows, between sexual abuse and non-violence and, let's say, other predestined.</seg>
<seg id="2951">It has also been dealt with incidents of the period since 1945, so also for four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choir director of the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole awful test pedagogy, the cases in which the boys of sadistic teachers have been schizily and malicious, and unabruptible, took place all of them at school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have ruled.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only to face when they were already at the top of the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On him, like most witnesses, the subject "Preschool" tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise of paradise."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadious violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And that also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims of R. estimated the general humanity by R. and therefore in many cases even positive memories will connect with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">Thus, at the most, the accusation remains to be taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, despite all efforts, the report could define only two periods in which it was reported by the states at the Preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and from the predecessors at a school where he had not worked and responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Enoss Georg Ratzinger systematically rigorously the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domenatzengymnasium, which was even reproduced by the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he demonstrates that" "" "the test for testing will continue to be practised" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Even in view of the risk of negative pressurization, he received urgent consent.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as an investigator, in Bavaria long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they occurred in a legal grey zone, as each of us still knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate where those affected may be exaggerated or dramatic and where really the permissible limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can't say, he would have always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That is just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the test sentence was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards on that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we speak as historians of "Fallstrick of Anachronism," so the danger to evaluate the past today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has quite right here.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is of course not for sexual abuse, who was abstained at all times, and not for what was broken in the preschool of adjunctions and violence against innocent children's soul, that goes far beyond that.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's all terrible and I'm happy that it will finally be recorded.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Its funds for disciplines and punishment, i.e. ear plugs and ears, were widely used in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then banned, he also stripped himself.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what is the picture of his time George Ratzinger came back in our talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of Prüfer Penalty for the Language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, as the Domsparrows played only a minor part.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I don't forget that he was a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this must also be said: without these perfectionism, without the unconditional discipline, it would be hardly possible to form a institution of world tranches, true cultural ambassador in Europe and its musical tradition, which went straight twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With Keksen and Bonbons alone, one doesn't make any big singer now and before every success, right in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-persuasion.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What a man do you have experienced George Ratzinger in talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition I met Georg Ratzinger really well and always seen as wonderful, humorous, basic, deep believing and hearty people, of whom you can't imagine that he could only do a fly a fly somewhat.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I am regularly updated with how many former Domsparrows are still in contact with him today, 23 years after his embargo, visit him regularly - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who don't forgive him until today, that he once was strict to them, so are definitely in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domsparrows are grateful to him today that he enriches their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he was always a good, paternal teacher - a stringent father, certainly that may be - but still a lovable respect to which they still look up and to revert them today.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once more clearly: everything you accuses to him are educational methods that were at the time at the time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, just because it is prominently and a more prominent brother to make a median scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the bad intention behind it, just too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which was just released, was discharged.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the annexed area, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great services and without the outside of Bayerns, and perhaps of Germany would probably know no one who would have known the domes of domes in peace, finally in peace.</seg>
