a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stair@@ case of a local shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said that he could not imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Finally , it went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ pse of San Francisco was identified on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field mall , which was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gal@@ icia in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and investigation .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ icia , shared the ABS broad@@ caster K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who worked as a cook in Boston before six months ago she had his dream job as chef in the Sons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ter Restaurant in San Francisco .
a spokes@@ man for the Sons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters said that it was shocked and eliminated in the ground . &quot;
&quot; we are a small team , which works like a close family and we will miss him so much , &quot; said the speaker .
our thoughts and our con@@ dol@@ ences are in this heavy time with Fran@@ ks Family and friends .
Louis Gal@@ icia admitted that Frank was first living in host@@ els , but that , &quot; the things were finally uphill for him . &quot;

Louis Gal@@ icia said he could not imagine anyone who would hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
having to connect his family with his family , it was always something to cook us to prepare for dinner , &quot; said Louis Gal@@ icia .
he never wanted to take part in any kind of confron@@ tation .
he was the brother , who sw@@ am with electricity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ defeated diamond , who lit every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information about the event will be asked to call the execution of the SF@@ PD under the number 415 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
Jennifer Ani@@ ston : I always put in dra@@ wers .
Jennifer Ani@@ ston is not always perfect or successful .
this has been made clear to the Hollywood star in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will always be put in dra@@ wers or get stuck from the outside label , which with me and the reality usually have little to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , these things are rather sn@@ u@@ ppe . &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh that it is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as it explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
most likes the actress spend their time at home , pre @-@ tel@@ ev@@ ised TV with lo@@ cker@@ em de@@ br@@ is and mexican food , it &apos;s in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the Weiß@@ gl@@ ut she loves the question of the children &apos;s desire : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have to be married or children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new movie &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - love is not a children play &quot; anim@@ ston as a single mother of two sons .
the movie runs with us from August 25 .
Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the py@@ rami@@ ds
his experiences on the horse are aw@@ ful .
at the end of a golf club in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a little bit of variety with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sport pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a couple of minutes , the horses were re@@ minded of their celebrations , they drove back home in the fast g@@ ust at home .
one kilometre at this pace , I &apos;m afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and thus the riding career ended up again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses .
he left his family with his family on the system of AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not catch himself into photography .
the first time in Aachen , Germany , was the first time in Aachen , too .
the reason was absolutely convincing .
the German sports assistance handed over to the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small gala &apos;s Golden Sport@@ pyramid .
awards are not lacking for the sympath@@ etic sport@@ sman .
Federal Constitutional Cross , silver bay leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen already ad@@ ores him .
the 18th pri@@ zew@@ inners of the Sport@@ py@@ rami@@ de is long ago .
in Aachen , he met the first prize lau@@ re@@ ate Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only for sporting successes but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger promotes the offspring .
and so he was the prize of 25,000 euros in the same way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 further outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US @-@ ma@@ stur@@ d@@ winner was added to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of Fame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the gymn@@ asi@@ er Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the jumping Al@@ win Sho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ous of the hand@@ b@@ aller Erhard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports fans came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the lively company emigrated to the Spring@@ st@@ adion , where the Lav@@ az@@ za price ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ ton and Tr@@ um@@ ps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and the trade agreement T@@ TP - we want to prevent both Clinton and the Tr@@ ump .
the two US presidential elections are , however , in the tax and energy policy , as well as in a basic question .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hillary Clinton lies a prin@@ ci@@ ary , rather philosoph@@ ical difference .
the , about the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to control the economy to death and regulate the economy , he says .
he himself would be completely different , claimed Tr@@ ump .
he will return reg@@ ulations back massi@@ vely , and he makes himself strong for a widespread tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for businesses .
Clinton says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities to open and needs money .
therefore , taxes would increase taxes for the rich , she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
to be invested in the man@@ ure , dr@@ ump and Clinton say almost wor@@ shi@@ ped .
the democratic applicants announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ ach@@ y wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
so in tr@@ ump , party @-@ internal discussions might be given .
more significant are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal plants and drive coal into the USA .
oil production is also expected to be possible in so far protected areas , to termin@@ ate the Paris Climate Agreement .
Clinton wants to extend the renewable energies with their investment program , and demands : &quot; a country will create the super power of the clean energy and create millions jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be China , Germany or America - I want us to be there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only with the infrastructure - even with international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ fish trade agreement , do not want to sign .
at the same time , both the US do not want to deal with international trade - but simply protect American jobs .
they should then be paid better , calling for Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25@@ US dollars is a star@@ vation .
he wants to increase it to $ 15 per hour .
what Tr@@ ump does to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be , he says , he must not be changed .
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the control of the two camps .
on the one hand , tr@@ ump , which aims to boost the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics hold him , so that the budget deficit would only be greater .
on the other hand , Clinton says that at least the rich wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; any wing@@ ed wife has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is owned by women who flee alone , almost daily .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen , four women sit .
each one has a baby , which is at most a year old .
one has laid her little son in his arm .
he looks curious with big eyes in the room .
his mother star@@ es on a table top .
until she noticed that she is watched .
she sm@@ iles short and kissed his little ones .
the scene works normal .
until you speak to Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is the area Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals with the theme of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are wing@@ ed .
they live in the Munich North in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alized accommodations for all@@ po@@ unded women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made up the establishment with Pro Family and the Munich Women Aid .
it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - as well as visitors .
the exception is an wax before the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ation to say : every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee to wars because they are politically persecuted because they are torture or death , or because their families send them as hope to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in women , other reasons were silent for the escape : &quot; many will steal away , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
in their homeland , they have made an experience with sexual violence , forced mar@@ riages , honorary murder , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
that drives them away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; for example , that the tu@@ g@@ boat demand for a bottle of water is not a rarity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that the end as soon as they come to Germany , Irish , tells B@@ ahr .
even here women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered as mines and ab@@ used in a worst case .
this leads to that about 90 percent of women living in the apartment in the Munich North , trau@@ mati@@ zed , estimates them .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntarily produced . &quot;
many women are so familiar with that they say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about experiencing life , because the shame is too large . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often do not help to help , more accommodations need for them , urges B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district management boards are responsible for the placing of refugees .
on the question , whether they are using a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz region and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is no such thing in accomod@@ ations of the governments .
in Schw@@ aben , women were not accommod@@ ated separately alone , Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Press@@ es@@ pre@@ cher of the Government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Lower and Central fran@@ ken , there are only two store@@ ys , or houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations for women .
the committee &quot; rights of women and equality of the sexes &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately from men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the Committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women can be accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the privacy or women are accommod@@ ated together , it may be too - ongoing - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all the shower room should be separately accessible , and for women easily accessible , stands in the study .
how much the women feel the need for this protection , you can feel the same in the And@@ re , which there is at the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since they have been talking about it , we have a long queu@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily take a second house .
assistance ologists strike : demand for new workers &quot; events
deputy members of assistance ologists have called upon their union to appro@@ ve new jobs in disp@@ utes about a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) demanded its total advice from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that it had drawn minister to enter the concerns about the contract .
in July , Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ in@@ arians and doctors have voted against the re@@ jection of a contract that was agreed with the BM@@ A .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted to the elections .
in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had remained quietly &quot; to problems , which led to the contract that the contract was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering the J@@ DC board has voted to fully reject the proposed new contract and requ@@ esting all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today announced a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to start a running program of escal@@ ating work , beginning of September .
the disp@@ utes led to assistance in Assi@@ sts this year six times , the first total accidents in the history of N@@ HS .
the director of the BM@@ A Regist@@ rar , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , joined the terms of the contrac@@ tual agreement that had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ in@@ arians and medi@@ z@@ inst@@ aller , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health said H@@ unt , that the agreement for physicians would be for@@ ci@@ bly introduced in England .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of State lateral &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that finished a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give his hands and an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish opposite in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Petersburg &apos;s Palace in reception , I cannot rever@@ t the int@@ ru@@ cks that Ankara wants to most reconciliation .
there was the hand , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile worked sham@@ eless and he radi@@ ated hardly heat , even for his restra@@ ined relationships .
on the other hand , Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke of his &quot; dear Friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times .
I could not count it anymore .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even better be improved .
the next day , a newspaper explained that Erdo@@ gan would have heard such an worst thing .
to me his enthusiasm seemed to signi@@ fy the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable kitchen showed that Russia &apos;s President of Russia had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduction : the down@@ fall of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border by Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was burned .
Putin told and accused Ankara to have fallen into his back .
the reason was even greater , as it was committed by a presum@@ ed friend .
the Vet@@ rop@@ es is re@@ building up again , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the nation@@ ally controlled media led a sharp , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
once , it seemed like the Turks would carry guilty for everything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleg@@ ations of senior officials believed that Erdoğan would have benef@@ ited from illegal oil trade in the provinces of Syria , who will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he disputed this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology of President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a cease @-@ fire supply are clear .
Erdo@@ gan needs first all the friends that he can get after spending the last month in a failed coup d &apos;@@ etat .
terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey - especially the prohibition of charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal hi@@ on@@ s@@ lau@@ ght of the Mediterranean .
this week , the German TV @-@ Billi@@ ger@@ es predicted fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed to be allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulated this way : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists stayed there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West , since it was response to the attempted power station as a weak response .
to do this , the persistent gro@@ ll come across the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is pi@@ red on it , from the cool mood benefits and reduce the relation of Turkey to the West .
in Ankara , Russian state of state gained a bonus that he demanded the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat with the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
that is good for Moscow , a comprehen@@ si@@ veness , which has to change themselves a profound fear of regim@@ es .
the summit in this glorious palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey , as it once described me an analyst , &quot; Alliance of Foreign Affairs &quot; : two countries which are disper@@ sed by the West and well treated them badly .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , between the two still great differences exist .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently announced the role as peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support each other side .
it could be noted that after nearly three hours of first talks , both the pre@@ sidents in the press conference said that they didn &apos;t even stri@@ ped the topic .
the president of Turkey , however , failed to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to empha@@ size this .
there is no clear con@@ sensus about where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect Dis@@ aster , when NATO member Turkey abol@@ ished the Russian fighter jet - it certainly is better that the two leaders talk at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside of Scotland
the R@@ BS brand should be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the Bank &apos;s Head of Staff .
the Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand joined the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
the bank has since dist@@ anced itself , when it had to be cured almost eight years ago and had to be saved .
at this time brand str@@ at@@ ches &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end consumer goods brands .
it supported the international sports with millions of pounds to sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Rug@@ by to the Wimbledon winner Andy Murray .
but now she has decided to focus more national brands into the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised head@@ quarter and the stock market at Nat@@ West are changing .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller stamps for the private customer business that will get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was interviewed during a viewing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will be employed to our Invest@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brand , as well as the brand , under which our employees will be employed since we are now going to become more of a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I say now that we do not track global targets , but pursue local goals .
each of these trademarks will be completely different in their own con@@ greg@@ ations , and our employees will work among the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue its Six Nations Sponsor@@ ing , and that it will increase the per@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility of various brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop towards the bank of the brands , because how do we concentrate on inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bench for customers ? &quot; said the Executive Board .
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical three years ago when we said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these stamps .
but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can restart these stamps again , so I think that time has come .

I am very emotional because my family is here
I am very happy that it &apos;s done with New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the jubil@@ ation when he brings the victory at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ ey@@ s reached the milestone in the obstac@@ le race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 times winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career .
Lester &apos;s Pig@@ got@@ t , The Nin@@ th Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4.@@ 4@@ 93 Kar@@ lov@@ es@@ goat
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern@@ ity and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone , which only few before it reaches .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect , distingu@@ ishing him from the other in weight control room .
he has been a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma fans already for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie before a couple of weeks at Ep@@ s@@ om that he had already fet@@ ched 6,000 profits if he wouldn &apos;t just had a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie had already lost nearly 30 years of winning players , which is great .
he has a living person , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .

three years ago he had encountered difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his branch and return to its top shape .
and he is not yet in the end - D@@ ett@@ ori said earlier , that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ 000.000 years .
Russia &apos;s Putin fired Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expect@@ edly dismissed his Chief of Staff , Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the closest colleague of Putin many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old has been appointed Special Represent@@ ative for environmental and transport matters .
in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Putin is that Putin had ordered no indication &quot; the dis@@ miss@@ al Ivan@@ ov@@ s of his duties as Chairman of the Russian President . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been a deputy chairman since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Est@@ onian capital city Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IM@@ O ) and worked in Tokyo &apos;s embassy .
on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website , it says ( in Russian ) that he later became a tran@@ sit@@ ory leader and leader of the government .
commenting on his appointment , he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the main task of the government to support your activity as state @-@ chief of legislative and inspec@@ tions to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin told the Russian television station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked about to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
do the smiling faces look for ?
this step has been mysterious in Moscow .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time of the closest confi@@ d@@ ant Vladimir Putin and works as he was for Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , both men were broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff came back on his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , here are few of them convinced - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections .
so here is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows that .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man , who once was sur@@ named as a potential president , would like to lead to Russian environmental policy - pushed attention to big scep@@ tic@@ ism .
in his remarks on Putin , which are quoted on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It &apos;s true that I asked you in early 2012 in a conversation , I could almost tell me this very complicated post - one could almost say - to trust in position four years .
as it turns out , I have been Chairman of the Russian President &apos;s President for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
before , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian security Council and how Putin was a former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , he was elected to the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin came to power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , whom he trusted .
once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov would become president of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term of Putin would exp@@ el the Constitution .
but this post was taken by another , near Allies Put@@ to , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin was Prime Minister before he was elected president of three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gibson fired after he struck producers
Gibson was involved in a physical meditation on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced its termination at a joint statement .
Gibson , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , was made public on Thursday before the announcement of his release .
on the set it came to artistic differences and a differences of opinion .

puzzles for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
one of Ban@@ ff &apos;s inhabitants demanded help to identify the fish that di@@ pped in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could deal with the 75 fish around sand@@ a@@ ale , which were fed by a fountain of foun@@ tains .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearing of the two inches long fish .
Queens@@ b@@ Cross@@ ing : bridge now associated with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north deck of the Queens@@ bi Cross@@ ing with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning the bridge is now connected to a loop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four inter@@ locking of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; covers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is the completion of approaching the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 scra@@ p pieces .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy , Keith Brown , visited the building site today and was one of the first to go on the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment at the construction of the Queens@@ b@@ ang@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of a engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30.000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
in total , nearly 79 % of the entire bridge de@@ cks in their place and last section of the deck is today in Ros@@ y@@ th a concrete shot for the deck , meaning that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to his place .
Michael Martin , Head of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Construc@@ tors , said : &quot; the first cl@@ asp represents a significant milestone in every bridge project .
at this fantastic project , the lock is looking forward to looking forward @-@ looking high@@ - and civil engineering .
following the installation of the last street circuit and its connection with the north tower deck , we had to close the gap on the north or land @-@ side .
this was reached by pulling the northern sugar bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and very delicate activity .
massive , because the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct has 222 m long , weighs approx . 6.000 tons and had to be drawn up at a slope of about 3 % .
mend the toler@@ ances that the team works , tiny - on each side , they were only a few milli@@ meters .
thank@@ fully everything went very well .
salvation in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; fortunately still alive &quot;
three men have &quot; lucky yet to be alive , &quot; after they were thrown from their fishing boat before Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station w@@ asted on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alert , after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved out from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and put us the worst before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vince Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luckily , the strong winds have reached the boat except its range until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted in the age of 60 and was found in a bo@@ di@@ ly without life@@ jacket .
they all arrived on board of coastal boots and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water were lucky and yet to be alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat @-@ engine had a not@@ ions , although the boat dis@@ band@@ ed at the boot of the boat from the person who ste@@ ered the boat .
someone has gotten more about these men today .
seriously injured - man sti@@ cking to his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and heavily injured .
as the police continued yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had gotten the key to the apartment to get his personal things .
instead , the dr@@ unken perpet@@ rators cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when she came into the apartment , he stab@@ bed twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in his hand and on the body .
the police could take the perpet@@ rators .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother .
this al@@ armed then his sister .
together with their livel@@ ihood , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
however , she could not move it to leave the apartment .
that is why she went to the house with her life .
on the road they met the ex @-@ habitats of the man .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old broke his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds Braunschwei@@ ger cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Green fo@@ es my : investors will then be much stronger in the future .
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig in the next years will lose almost 1300 favorable apartments ?
the SPD proposes a &quot; action concept living &quot; for the next rat@@ ern@@ ity .
but controversy is programmed .
first and foremost , the question is : who is supposed to build the favorable apartments ?
a regulation is lacking so far .
Christoph Brat@@ mann said : &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : &quot; who wants to build on urban surfaces in the future , must notify 20 percent of all apartments as a social housing . &quot;
the inexpensive apartments , however , can also be created in the continu@@ ance .
however , the large number of forces in the city hall was , however , says Fr@@ mann : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private homes ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent of these areas , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments are building as a social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new residential residential construction programme , which will cost millions and has to be financed , shall provide incen@@ tives .
the problem so Brat@@ mann : &quot; there are still no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors a few rules as possible .
the Left will still want tough@@ ness for investors .
regardless of its , so Brat@@ mann , can be introduced to the situation on the housing market .
if the action plan is implemented , it will provide additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is required .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
yet the program doesn &apos;t open completely : for the around 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you compare the loss of some 1,@@ 300 affordable dwell@@ ings , whose promotion will run out in the next few years ?
by 2020 , it will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , the plan@@ ing policy of Nicole &apos;s Palm , should now be rede@@ emed to be purchased from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought to bring apartments back into the price binding .
this is possible in the west city .
in a blow , solve the problem .
because at the end of the western city , the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments you could bring back into the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : we do not want the owners , the housing companies .
because the number of social apartments in the west city has dras@@ tically increased , it is removed from the target of the so @-@ called mixing .
a concentration of social weak in just a few neighbour@@ hoods will not give it any more .
the Gre@@ ens are expecting it to be more moving in discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a vast majority , CD@@ U must be added to the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have focused on more grounds for family homes .
but what does not mean , that no compromise can be found yet .
Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , that pays off
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
teenagers and child to play no longer go out to play , but rather rather prefer to spend their free time on display , on display , has been compl@@ ained by many in the last decade .
at Po@@ k@@ emon Go there is to get people from the sofa and get more active .
at the beginning of the screen it was limited to TV , then on video games and last on smartphones .
therefore , it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities not close mut@@ ually exclusive .
I am moving forward to Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later from it a cartoon series , playing cards and other Sp@@ in @-@ off@@ s ) .
how many phenomena of pop culture fell in front of the game &apos;s release in the United States , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the market launch in other countries was post@@ pon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ loaded the server .
within days Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go more users as T@@ inder and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go out with their smart phones and search for Po@@ k@@ é@@ mons that are followed with a GPS and once they were found once , &quot; photographed &quot; ( about a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the w@@ ahn and jumped for the search of the sofa .
in the United States , the game led to a considerable increase of steps which dates the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
car@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , the 35@@ ,000 users post@@ pon@@ ed , shared the Washington Post recently with that within two days after the introduction of the game , the number of following people followed by 45 per cent to 53 percent each day .
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon go - it merely looks the raw data to increase performance .
many public recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance campaigns for the health , people who want to take care of &quot; 30 minutes &quot; to come &quot; from the sofa &quot; and &quot; to be active &quot; every day &quot; beat on deaf ears because many public messages come to health and come from people who look like .
nevertheless , the importance of sports can not be over@@ rated .
those who regularly drives sport , reduces his odds to treat cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages that is too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine and fun .
some people join the hunt even new friends .
as always , well @-@ ind@@ rical toys , which have always been compl@@ aining about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what should I do ?
a breakthrough has happened .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit earlier could follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports , as does this game do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new will lose its appeal and use the use of time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , due to Po@@ k@@ em@@ ons success , there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ites of the real world and helping many people on hunting , more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

and now the Olympic Champion was finally born .
the 19 @-@ year old American gymn@@ ast er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for the combined events and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world in front of all the eyes of the Olympic Games .
their total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly found in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team kam@@ er@@ adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the Americans of Simone Bil@@ es came to the Swedish Baltic during the second competition of the women at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual player , which wins a combined fight , and altogether the fifth , while they consoli@@ date their reputation , the best of their generation , or even at all .
she broke out in tears as their final result was shown and her long journey took place at this moment .
she introduces it to the same league , such as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports up to new heights :
Bil@@ es domin@@ ates her sport in the last three years , including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that have a mixture of am@@ bition and precision that she said &quot; the best gymn@@ ast is that I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it was expected to be a final test in Brazil , a competition that didn &apos;t go so much between fine and the rest of the athl@@ ete , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not return with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the Americans of Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace her after each of the gold and silver in the single competition of women at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , won
Bil@@ es won the first medal on Tuesday , while she retired from retired Team Co@@ ordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i as an ex@@ clamation mark .
although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted on the top of their long road to the top , never to have the future planned , this is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which included its typical tum@@ bling pass , is tailored to Latin American music that would suit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school tour in the gym hall , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man .
since summer 2013 she has lost no more competition competition , a victory of victory , which will hold so long as it wishes .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina led by two revol@@ ts slightly , the image collapsed .
pig beams and soil particles - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title .
she repeated again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the pig , and sat on the ground with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man stir@@ red her gently when she expected her En@@ der@@ g@@ ness - a pure form@@ ality - and tears poured on fine red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , when the vision described it once in her collection book , to reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal was in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke to Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team capital , called &quot; grand@@ ma , &quot; had a lead .
after their soil , she threw the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that was sometimes dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as in the beginning of this week , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old Twe@@ et has become a very important role in the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims in a mur@@ der@@ ous case in the car shot in the car
according to police reports that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girls were shot dead in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first standard mur@@ der@@ ous incident , while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah was shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked during a trip , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots from a fire weapon while driving on the passenger side of the car , and then fled with another vehicle , is read in the report .
the police shared with that the triple murder could not have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , as the att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which were in possession of one of the adult victims .
Jonathan S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting of the investig@@ ator has led the investig@@ ators to become a close look at whether it is connected to four earlier attacks .
in total , seven people were killed and two more injured in h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic residential neighbor@@ hoods within four months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Howard der K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including one brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to exp@@ ose the evidence that they led to the conclusion that attacks are linked to the same mur@@ derer .
Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ itali@@ zed due to their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site .
a witness the police shared with that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report about shooting shooting at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of a serial killer .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ y@@ ül@@ sen and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it becomes better &quot;
like most 6 year old , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the f@@ ew@@ est of its aging , Edmund Micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , knew nothing about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during their pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought was , I create that .
I don &apos;t create that .
I didn &apos;t let me introduce myself .
what is not right at all -- of course , one has settled on it , &quot; she said .
her husband Vincent and her was told that Edmund could never know them under circumstances , and that he may not survive once .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed him to institutional .
&quot; my first answer to that &apos; I did not know the people still do , &apos; declared Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund can run with help of a aid .
Edmund could neither sit even cra@@ w@@ ling until his third year of life and he still cannot speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth is showing the symbol@@ ism that Edmund for &quot; Please sing something out of me . &quot;
&quot; we bring it to the drawing language , &quot; tells Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical drawing language -- says she . Edmund has invented some signs alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as with Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or z@@ ic@@ avirus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect life with the Z@@ ik@@ avirus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to remembers the emotional price of a uncertain future .
I asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t know .
I &apos;ve been asked for a long time not even after the pro@@ g@@ nosis , because I didn &apos;t expect to really tell me anyone .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avirus .
it is getting better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives occasion to salvation in Louisiana , Mississippi
heavy rainfall and widespread floo@@ ding in Louisiana forced the governor to proc@@ laim the emergency in Friday . on Friday , the whole Saturday was reck@@ oned with more rain .
numerous rivers in the sou@@ theastern Lou@@ isi@@ anas and the south of the s@@ wind@@ y flooded their banks and threatened with large @-@ scale flood after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported National weather service .
the governor of Louisiana John B@@ el Edwards shared with that state officials are standing in contact with local authorities and was already on the road to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness , shared with that the requests for high water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa said ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system will be used across wide parts in the south Lou@@ isi@@ anas until Saturday .
the weather service provided that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this field .
in the south of Alabama , a flood warning system was used on Friday , while it was still ra@@ ined in the mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite close to Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite close to Den@@ ham Springs , which both are located in Louisiana , will reach a record level of all probability after the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Krau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers can flooded several houses in the presence of Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a flood down@@ ward flood in A@@ scen@@ sion Par@@ ish represents a danger , because these floods are slowly flowing into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the Tick@@ le river , south of the Mississippi River border in Liverpool , Louisiana , arrived on Friday at 09.@@ 00 the highest level ever recorded .
there are still some people from the flood water in the Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son district in the south @-@ west of Mississippi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ mother , were among those who were rescu@@ ed near Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet from his house , rise overnight .
he said that another step of step@@ ping , who lives near , warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and poured out the water and poured into the water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife said Hans@@ ford that she lived in the 48 years in which she lived there , never had seen such a high tower of the river .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that sa@@ vers had rescu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
Krau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood had spread rapidly , as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls , and that the authorities were ev@@ acu@@ ating ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions .
according to Krau@@ t@@ mann a ob@@ servers in the vicinity from Living@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
Krau@@ t@@ mann said that the ground has been significantly higher since Wednesday .
the authorities arrested that heavy rainf@@ alls and road floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and teaching in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that there was 200 flooded houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , both flooded with them both .
the fore@@ se@@ er of the municipality Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities were rescu@@ ed 72 people and seven pets , which were washed from the flood .
in the cities Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond were established shelter to host the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; once the water starts to go back , they will go back into their houses , &quot; he said .
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , nearly two dozens of streets were closed due to floo@@ ding and sand@@ bags for the residents , hoping to keep the water from their homes and stores .
&quot; the last big flood , which we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the municipal office .
this seems to be a similar incident .
the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy &apos;s emergency manager said that it was still ra@@ ined on the Gulf Coast .
according to his information , a hand@@ ful of homes have been reported on Thursday as over@@ flowing , but on Friday there were no noti@@ fications till now .
Keith Town@@ son , manager with shop@@ per value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places where I never seen it before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Town@@ son said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; by balls , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police shares that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 year old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents said that Brown suffered several shot injuries , including in the lame , leg , arm and belly , but that he was at the hospital in his transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has performed a lot , his little body was crossed by balls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divided his grandmother del@@ ores mel@@ ody . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe that .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital , and he had to under@@ go various operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the transmitter , that he is likely to read again .
he could have started the first class in a local elementary school .
Brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old age .
one of the 29 @-@ year old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in stable state .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is located in a critical condition , was fin@@ ed on the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were determined whether one of the injured men of the perpet@@ rators could be .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seems to have come to a cruise fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
patches for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which have been prosec@@ uted to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , se@@ wn the crime scene .
it seems that this is definitely the case for a lasting fight .
on the street , on both sides of the walk@@ way , they were leg@@ ging .
here it seems several armed fighters to have been involved , who were very active in the police , the police department Anthony G@@ inal@@ di police arrested in Philadelphia .
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
there was no arrest and the police checks out reports according to the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross @-@ sl@@ ayer in the arm when she played in front of her house in the West O@@ ak Lane .
she recovered , and the police still seeks to susp@@ end .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I present under the women &apos;s olymp@@ i@@ am@@ ity in the gymn@@ as@@ shop@@ per and that of more than one reason .
first of all , I have been so dominant in 1984 at every summer Olympics and the USA were never so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three Tur@@ ner@@ men , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess is and Madison Ko@@ cian , the Kath@@ o@@ lik@@ ine is round , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the United States .
it has strengthened the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
over the last four years the number one was one Af@@ ro @-@ Americans .
last year was Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this is showing strength .
during the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and the America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of three times world championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they were unexpected , but master@@ fully Gy@@ mas@@ tics were provided .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual men who won gold with an individual combined event for women .
man member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but do not see gym classes in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympi@@ ad will only have four tur@@ ists in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mar@@ ta Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer .
but reality looks like that Tur@@ nen is a more expensive sport and Turner first line in private gym , which are maintained by parents , which will rise from parents , competition , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the train@@ ers and their Turner and families ) . the list lets you continue .
the majority of these turn@@ outs are in weal@@ thy suburbs that can help business .
in these clubs , Turner will receive its entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both her athletes , since they started with the Tur@@ ning .
we must unite the con@@ greg@@ ations Au@@ n countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ reach gym training .
I founded my gy@@ ms version of 20 years .
during my events , we have set free and affordable Tur@@ ning in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth ( mainly black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic ) , and national and international winners .
in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth of high quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that make the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport .
Tur@@ ning develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and consistency for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as training and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that make thousands of young girls to care for the Tur@@ ning and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in the sport , especially for girls .
this is so exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this genuine representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the wood of the Olympic team gold and thank you , for so many young girls with different background motiv@@ ates to begin their way to start healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant doctors want to organise further strikes after they rejected Jeremy Hun@@ ting proposal
the ministers hoped to end the dispute concerning the amend@@ ment of a re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 per cent of the 3@@ 7.000 Assi@@ sts , who voted in a vote , refused him .
in July H@@ unt &apos;s plans revealed to introduce the contract , and said that N@@ HS was in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful .
the first assistance doctors should receive a new contract , which includes changes on night and weekend work , to improve the maintenance time .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Com@@ mitt@@ ees , announced last night in a communication with : &quot; assistance sts , &quot; especially that it will heat the current financial crisis and serve it to treat all doctors . &quot;
only eight weeks left , which still remain , until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , must be made progress and the time runs out .
efforts from BM@@ A to solve disp@@ utes through discussions regarding the government &apos;s solution to take part in the government and sometimes s@@ ligh@@ ing silence .
it was the result of a promise that Jeremy H@@ unt had made it last month , that his door would always be off@@ ended .
&quot; Jeremy H@@ unt needs to act now , raise up vibration and address the concerns of assistance sts . &quot;
if he did not do this , then they have made it clear , they are ready to perform more working tests .
the last strike at the end of April saw a delay of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates before , as nur@@ ses and professionals have been involved in order to grant doctors on the strike chain coverage .
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes made by acceptance of the reform of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants to be a better week@@ day event for the 5@@ 4.000 Regist@@ rar , which will be subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS employees , called for the assistant doctors to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour measures are not only little , but already loaded team and service providers and prepare the patient , nur@@ ses and their families only wor@@ ries , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the past two months , we talked with the committee of assistance doctors and with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stri@@ es responded to the concerns about the gu@@ ardi@@ an@@ ship and the W@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
the employers hopes that this continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as aston@@ ishing , flexibility in training , additional training , training , mutual recognition , training , training , mutual recognition of the cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ ation of education , education holidays and the Ministry of Health concerning compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 per day medication that can reduce heart attacks of heart attacks
thousands of heart disease patients will benefit from a £ 2 per day medication , after the authorities recommended , to date more people for a longer period .
the ger@@ inn@@ ate medicine T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of re@@ peti@@ tive heart attacks for persons suffering from heart disease .
the medicine is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thereby reduces the risk of strokes or another heart attack .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has been recommended for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has been recommended for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 140@@ ,000 people suffer heart attack and a quarter of it suffer another heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulation of fet@@ ched material in the arter@@ ies , the layers are forming .
when the Bel@@ ag breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that causes blood flow to the heart and caused a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots sol@@ ves , it can flow through the flow of blood and the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who had already had a heart attack had to be subject to a higher risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is distributed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots impro@@ b@@ able .
the design of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with twice daily taking of asp@@ ir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , director of the N@@ ICE health research centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who suffered a heart attack , a further heart attack or stroke - often with des@@ ast@@ ro@@ asts . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of one person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is in combination with asp@@ ir@@ in effectively in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack .
through a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are happy that we are able to expand the treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit .
the information about the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . the introduc@@ tory bill does not recommend any treatment that goes beyond this period .
culture of Political correc@@ t@@ ness can flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on the release of a government report on corruption from office
a culture of political correc@@ t@@ ness has led to largely ignored the widespread election fraud in Muslim communities such as a devastating government report .
the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kles attacks the police , election ob@@ servers , and Rath@@ en@@ í@@ ns to have evidence of electoral abuse regarding eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot;
former Minister for Integration and Community Government , who is now an ant@@ agon@@ ism of religious motivation so bad , that it should be allowed to set out the police orders outside of poll@@ uting to protect voters outside of poll@@ uting .
he recommends that voters should lead a identity card to prove their identity in elections .
at the time a voters call only his name and address .
the report suggests , not removable ink on the finger of a person if they release their voting rights to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
it demands that the press should have access to municipal documents and decisions from non official comm@@ itments or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only against election fraud , but also to protect the municipal government in front of the wider corruption and financial fraud , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special election tribunal decided that the current mayor of Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be revealed to a Lit@@ an@@ ei to corrupt and illegal practices of his am@@ bass@@ adors .
the court was that Rah@@ man had thought the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ n@@ ical way , &quot; and that he had put his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bi@@ en@@ accus@@ ations .
Rah@@ man should have led his campaign on the basis that it was the reli@@ ous duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the consequence of a follow @-@ up , when someone cho@@ oses someone else .
Sir Eric told it that there would be evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he encouraged particularly al@@ ar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of letters - with the older members of the Muslim community pressure to people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the voting system , including the guiding of evidence to prove identity
in his report it says : &quot; as proof , pressure on def@@ ici@@ encies of some ethnic minorities was perpet@@ rated , especially women and young people to choose among the will of the El@@ der , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ese or ban@@ quet background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns ... state institutions such a behaviour of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beliefs concerning eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric asked 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists of writing records to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poll@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , which is drawn from Ther@@ esa May in consideration , requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral list of immigration and social fraud purposes .
consider options , elec@@ tors in front of choice after your identification .
not removable ink on the finger of a person when she has left her voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person do to make sure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications to an automatic mail choice .
ban , political activists complete the local elections and env@@ elop@@ es of the local elections .
the police give the power to establish barriers to election stations .
a change of legislation requiring an indictment due to in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation of the People Act 1983 ( national representative law 1983 ) .
phot@@ og@@ ative for@@ b@@ ade in election stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the election stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fying the training , to ensure that the staff will rule the rule that voters go to the elec@@ oms alone .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &apos; amazing &apos; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case no criminal complaint was filed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the election tribunal has Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy , because of a Lit@@ an@@ ei to corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons for the criminal proceedings , he was found guilty of a number of reasons .
he also critici@@ zes the effective &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ age checks &quot; of the constitu@@ ents of the town halls .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court part in Tower Ham@@ lets from the last year was a warning signal .
our country contributes as the mother of par@@ li@@ aments as a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and covered spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger and other famous Doppel@@ gänger von Olympi@@ ans in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio have reached this week via the French cycling scientist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot except edge and band that has proved an impressive twin course of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 year old Olympi@@ ad in this summer is by far not the only one to give gold batt@@ ling athl@@ ete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not when you give the social media faith .
hon@@ oring the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , which at present on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL have created a lists of Olympic risks that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood &apos;s famous ties .
the fighter and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team in the ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood .
apart from K@@ ates Doppel@@ gänger on the cycling track many people on the internet are pointed out , like a certain ar@@ cher of the Di@@ dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be .
the team member of the U.S. team in the ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after images that he looks like to see the wolf of Wall Street Star sc@@ ary sc@@ ary .
in fact , the arch@@ ers got the mad@@ ness in the social media with and gave to hear that he had already heard since his childhood , that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I myself see no great simil@@ arity , with the exception of the facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy told the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good looking guy , so I can do it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will no doubt take place in the centre : the obvious simil@@ arity between the British tour Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her great , expres@@ sive eyes is to go through to the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
one speed higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the inc@@ eption acting
another additional comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , which has similar heavy eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova exhibits more than just the sun@@ b@@ arian skin and bl@@ on@@ ated hair as the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord while the American Nathan Adrian had att@@ ained by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and Dex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others like the simil@@ arities too .
theory in the room : according to this user , there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
a Twitter User@@ in explained its satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope solo and Dex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter have an unbeliev@@ ably similar visual form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical with the actress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , which resem@@ bles her own beautiful , wide smile , that resem@@ bles It On Star Gabrielle Union .

the comment@@ ator Byron Mac@@ Don@@ alds thought his microphone is switched off when he finished his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m free swimming pool .
Mac@@ don@@ ald who had been joined the comment@@ ator team of C@@ BS on board to give more &quot; colour , &quot; you could hear : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , he went like Mi@@ ef , died like a pig .
thanks for this .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second leg of swimming pool 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadian to stop the gap in China .
spectators throughout Canada re@@ acted quickly after they were shocked by the sound and language
&quot; &quot; &quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Did the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer in China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has died like a pig ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idi@@ ot has not cap@@ tiv@@ ated that they were still on the show . &quot;
Ai Yan@@ han from China became as described in the final 4 x 200m Fre@@ isti@@ l@@ wimming@@ el for women : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the cri@@ tique of Byron Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter came quickly and hard , when many of him were talking about him
Twitter users did not look back when they heard how un@@ sensitive Byron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user into Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; Wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you re@@ present the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us all look like R@@ assi@@ sts . # ange@@ elt .
a short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ don@@ ald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for a comment on a floating performance . &quot;
it was a un@@ happy chosen phrase , it &apos;s sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC was at the end of 90 times at the end of the people who responded to the emer@@ gen@@ cies via Twitter
comment@@ ator Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter operators who had compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ don@@ ald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed rapidly and issued a message .
we regret it correctly , that these statements were made , and that it was possible to broadcast them .
we fell quickly at our spectators yesterday night and ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our followers in social media .
in order to put one clear@@ ances , Byron &apos;s comments rel@@ ates to the performance of the law @-@ in and not on them as a person .
nevertheless they were in@@ appropriate and un@@ happy chosen phrase . Byron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ don@@ ald was arrested in the program and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention to support them as a personal attack .
&quot; I would like to take a moment of time to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment , which I made after the women &apos;s swimming pool in the C@@ BC Olympics , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have taken care of the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not related to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there was no contemp@@ t , and I &apos;m sorry . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark is ou@@ tra@@ ged by woman who tried under@@ wear under@@ wear in the middle of the business
the buyers did not know where to see , when a woman with@@ drew their clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try sub@@ sist@@ ence .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she mut@@ ed , as she looked out in it , drew back and put them back into the shelf .
she moved further and tried four pairs of sub@@ h@@ osen in a shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place mall in Folk@@ estone , on .
the Pri@@ mark Business in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman was trying the under@@ pants before they put them back into the shelf
a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ dson , who was at the same time in the business , said that once the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; she continued ste@@ aling , and the business left without buying something . &quot;
she said , &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot;
in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the balance , moved her own rhin@@ estones and tro@@ users out and tried them .
&quot; she didn &apos;t even tried to find a somewhat discreet place to do it - she just stood there , fre@@ ch like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when they returned the h@@ osen , which you obviously didn &apos;t like it , since they put them back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other sub@@ h@@ osen before she finally decided that nothing was right to reg@@ ain and out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not seem to distur@@ b anyone - or thinking about the person who would buy the sub@@ tro@@ users who had tried them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How do I think anyone would take home in his home , who had another person and had not been washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
Mrs. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; as I got along , the staff tried to pull the pieces of clothes from the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of sub@@ h@@ osen and to find out that another woman had her , and she had not washed her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is of the incident happened on Tuesday August 9 at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products in question were drawn from the sale .
how to protect themselves with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before arms attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail.com could make him safer for you .
we spoke with Rh@@ one Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to move with armed fighters to close distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or back , this video will show you how you turn the sk@@ ewer for your pre@@ dat@@ or .
when you turn back from behind , then you should be turned into turn , so that you can see your att@@ acker and get &quot; from the Fire line , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
take the gun then between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free el@@ bows .
then hit him with the knee in the bar and rotate , while the att@@ ack@@ ers come together with pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the barrel and move backward , while they address the weapon on him .
at att@@ ack@@ ers , approaching from the front , technology is similar - move your body from the casting line , take the weapon and rotate it , so that the att@@ acker can &apos;t shoot .
at the same time , put the weight on the weapon and beat the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip , before moving forward and set the weapon on him .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it does Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi pre@@ power .
but remember that there is a rob@@ ber@@ y on the saf@@ est way to cover your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
trav@@ eller Ian Wright sch@@ ab@@ t for a guide his tongue to the dirty places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ took the immune system and the ret@@ ef@@ lex of a serious test - putting some of the dirt and most adher@@ ed place in Europe .
the present@@ er and it@@ iner@@ ant Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ olk will scra@@ pe its wake up on a euro note , a ban@@ ister on the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a rinse kno@@ b of a train toilet as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system .
before removing any object , he used a lumin@@ ometers in order to show oneself and show us what he will be introduced .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title of The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , brought some surprising results of daylight .
the thought to push the r@@ ins@@ ist of a draw@@ back , which was already used by thousands others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact , there is more poor bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright said with doctors and medical specialists on promoting intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately , nothing left , that he stretched out , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ine by travelling through the world and ate pec@@ uli@@ ar as well as wonderful things .
from public rail@@ ways to train stations to dish@@ washers of toilets , the task proved its immune system definitely among a sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he told : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ worried about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and s@@ lu@@ dge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film he was justified in his call .
the only thing he dismissed was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its pro@@ be@@ ab@@ outs showed a lumin@@ ometric survey of more than 4000 units .
in comparison , the L@@ umin@@ ometer number is freshly washed hands less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to escape after their L@@ umin@@ ometer numbers amounted to more than 4,000 units , while freshly washed hands have a less than 60 units
Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy produce vali@@ o produced the travel time &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the worst thing I have ger@@ red in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing dirt than that !
I &apos;m not going to lick up here because it is indo@@ ors .
the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producers of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the Company equi@@ ps Mr Wright with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the encour@@ agement of intestinal bacteria and immune system .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , juices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer really something new .
something that is fascinating about looking at and simultaneously explains the advantages of Pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we led a crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings so that we were saying , &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in human health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon , and with the documentary we could provide more information on an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense for hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film direc@@ ting , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had checked some of the things I had directed to him , like the disgu@@ ised Russian toilet that will be shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things , with which it was easier to get Ian , to le@@ ase it and others , with which this was pretty difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats in film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in one of the survey conducted by the year 2015 , 84 percent of all respondents with lac@@ tic acid bacteria and 58 percent reported that they use at least occasionally products that contain lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
A@@ social family destroyed Del@@ og@@ ation social flat in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ ozi@@ ale family left her social flat after a delay with a loss of £ 50,000 because they terr@@ orized their neighbours .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their estate , the property of residential cooperative had the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able state .
the walls made clear holes , wooden layers were torn , tr@@ ash was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was ador@@ ned on the walls .
the family were moved and it is assumed that they now lives in a private accommodation .
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall Hous@@ ing , said that she is afraid that the apartment is no longer rep@@ airing .
she said , &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for people here and I agree that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider , since this property is probably considered as a beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror , which had joined the family , threw street fights with base camps , drug abuse , drugs and excessive scre@@ aming , stre@@ ws and flu@@ kes .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the rental contract , got a arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which will be demol@@ ished under circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found
in the property where drugs have been tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden layers are torn
neighbors told that they were fighting them on the street and called on the police regularly .
Corn@@ wall Hous@@ ing del@@ og@@ ated her and her partner this week for@@ ci@@ bly by the property , after they gave them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ ity were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who told her life was made for hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They were not ashamed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived for 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police are incredible .
&quot; today we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not staying here !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Hous@@ ing , said that it would have missed the family with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where police was called at regular intervals , 20 years .
on the outer side of the municipal house , tr@@ ash and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that it is the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and to accept the family , as a delay is always the last step into consideration the Corn@@ wall Hous@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was a very difficult case , as the behaviour was extrem@@ ly and their deeds had to be terrible for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police from Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the church , who have gra@@ c@@ eful to us and have given us the information you have done .
I hope this development will don@@ ate comfort , and convey@@ s the message that anti @-@ social behaviour will not be toler@@ ated .
Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons have lived at different times in the house , but that they all were over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left in one of the bedrooms of the house following del@@ og@@ ation on the ground .
workers of the house administration must be swe@@ pt away , that surround the house
in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as commodities , par@@ ap@@ her@@ nia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ eton received a fine , after having found herself guilty of a drug of class B in trade views .
she claimed that money was a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who came to life in 2013 during a car accident .
after they were without shelter , T@@ anya is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner lives in a private accommodation in Plymouth .
many room walls of the house were gra@@ ffiti by gra@@ ffiti .
the police says that it will not be inv@@ it@@ ating mi@@ eter , who do not keep in the house order .
Angela C@@ row from the Devon and Corn@@ wall police shared with that the Del@@ og@@ ation is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that don &apos;t keep in the house arrangement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think that without self @-@ accus@@ ations , as well as those who were har@@ med by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Devon and Corn@@ wall police will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that continue to work with partners to protect our municipalities .
tourists in Portugal located in panic , after an additional military jet is flying
sun@@ tan in Av@@ eiro , Portugal lived the shock of her life
a Portuguese P @-@ 3@@ C Orion plane of air forces put an incredible crash flight
the air forces gave that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no security risk .
this was the moment , in which frigh@@ tened tourists begin to get in panic after an ti@@ rail@@ ing Jet crashing about a full beach .
dramatic video recordings showed , as the military plane flew almost in tan@@ gible proximity to the sun@@ b@@ ans on the beach part in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the holi@@ day@@ makers break down , when they were understand@@ able , worried about the noise of the di@@ ci@@ vil@@ isation works , without first see what caused by the clouds to them .
the incident happened last afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many holi@@ day@@ makers who post@@ pon@@ ed videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew twice a very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it was desc@@ ending . &quot;
N@@ un@@ o arro@@ ja added : &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like that the plane would fall down on me . &quot;
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane came from the darkness , and was incredibly deep .
the Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and so deeply flying that this was the only possibility to recognise them .
the spokes@@ man said that the Jet flew somewhat deeper than usual in the vicinity of the area , however , the air force insi@@ sted that security at no time was at risk .
area fires have destroyed these summer parts of the Portuguese mainland , where four people were killed on the island of Madeira .
today the Portuguese Air Force gave us today that the pilot had to fly as low as high fog and bran@@ ding - hence his view .
the aircraft was on a training flight , where pilot fishing boats had to identify as part of the exercise

Donald Tr@@ ump grants ″ tremendous problems ″ on the campaign combat
the leadership of the U.S. Rep@@ ublic@@ ans will be pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive troubles , even in traditionally conservative states to ob@@ lige their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now gave weak@@ nesses of his election campaign in the Republican @-@ stron@@ gh@@ old Utah .
a very rare moment in which the Mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire normally reported something like concerns expressed as correspon@@ dents as correspon@@ dents .
having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within their own republi@@ can camp , the doubts start to grow in the struggle for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have enormous problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump from protest@@ ant Christians he asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
false reports of his can@@ di@@ dat@@ ure , he took up his well @-@ known media records .
republi@@ can floo@@ ding w@@ ack@@ ers
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ US in June , Tr@@ ump and his competi@@ tor were admitted by the Democrats , Hillary Clinton .
other institutes see tr@@ ump in front , but not by the distance that is common to Republican candidates in the state .
as endangered also Arizona and Georgia apply .
in an interview of the Senate CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question of how he wants to stop the pre@@ march of Clin@@ t again : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
and after that : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he makes nothing different , as &quot; tell the truth . &quot;
if it is not good for him , for reasons of political correc@@ t@@ ness , this would be al@@ right , the ump said further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party of Tr@@ ump should be threatened to submit funds to the support of his election campaign , it should be no better re@@ frac@@ tures .
instead of seeing the candidates for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans to take stronger under the arms .
Olympia : thirteen fraud at D@@ oping test
the IO@@ C plans to set up a discipl@@ in@@ arian commission .
Ken@@ ias athletes threat@@ ens after the second D@@ oping affair at Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro .
after an attempt at a d@@ oping control over a d@@ oping control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a coach to home .
the International Olympic Committee divided , promp@@ ted a discipl@@ in@@ arian committee to investigate the case .
a ken@@ ian function@@ ary was revealed that the former Sprinter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village called a urine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ L@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i .
this was reported to the team leadership of Ken@@ ias on D@@ oping control systems .
the IA@@ AF world association with information about the case is looking for information about the case to meeting their own research , a IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the study and the following measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will receive an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was named in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the D@@ oping control station and has spent himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , released the test and signed , &quot; said Ken@@ yan boss de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the athl@@ ete &apos;s ac@@ credit@@ ation , which stood on the list of training controls in the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was born in Beijing in 2015 over 800 meters .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Athle@@ tics Manager Michael Rot@@ ich was pulled off by the Rio Olympics .
he should have informed the pay@@ outs of his country on upcoming d@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he was reported to have been arrested in his return at the airport of Nairobi .
Kenya stands at the IO@@ C after many d@@ oping processes for longer time under special observation .
during the announcement of the IO@@ C , more than 2000 d@@ oping control checks before the Rio Olympics was previously pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are taken into the visor .
in Brazil , the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had committed much pressure on African country to create an anti @-@ D@@ oping law and a working control system .
a few weeks before the Olympics was passed .
as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya participated in the list of countries whose d@@ oping control is associated with the WA@@ DA rules .
Kenya is considered a big runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
in a series of TV report of the ARD , ARD reports revealed that D@@ oping funds are easily accessible , and there will be a considerable ment@@ ality of the athl@@ ete .
the IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und finally requested a similar investigation in Kenya as he put them in the Russian Athle@@ tics Championships .
this sport , however , has been proven that this sport style has been covered and systematically respected .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then exp@@ elled by the summer games .
Salz@@ burger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Salzburg Festival &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will present the &quot; West Side story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic lovers like Romeo and Julia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with us a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins master@@ piece .
the artistic director of Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring music in the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Maria .
in the orchestra , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra conducted by Gust@@ avo Dud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he is war@@ med .
we always say they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and mel@@ ody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have a lot of music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays an older brother Maria .
she remembers her lovers with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always been fascinated me .
first , because it is exceptional !
and then Mari@@ as Person@@ ality would be .
she says she &apos;s in her song : &quot; I Mc@@ Pret@@ ty , oh so Pret@@ ty , I Mc@@ Pret@@ ty and White and B@@ right . &quot;
it is so clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; it resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
Dud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor for us to work with her .
she is a mon@@ stro@@ us generous person .
and Bart@@ oli are back on the compli@@ ment : &quot; Dud@@ amel is an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
one sees it in every of his movements , in his gl@@ ances , it &apos;s his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , that is very important at all !
for the American director Philip W@@ m . McKin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up @-@ up : &quot; this piece is about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ smus . &quot;
today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York inhabitants they didn &apos;t want to .
these are the same subjects , and they are just as meaningful as at that time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .

the Tre@@ ats Magazine works with the photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mers to release a 1970s Pi@@ relli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous human beings , they would like to find out the next generation of Top@@ models for 2017 .
the chief editor of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us the beginning of this year , that his neck @-@ magazine of Old@@ school play@@ boys distingu@@ is@@ hable as &quot; Playboy for Men . &quot;

apparently he is the view that there is also calendar .
&quot; we have to return to the representation of timeless and classical nakedness , where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release to the publication of Cal@@ endars .

Turkey : Kurdish town@@ ship calcul@@ ates with mass cur@@ ses
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever doesn &apos;t fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on the packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the end of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kurdish congregation , Germany , expects a short @-@ term meeting with tens of thousands of protection who fled from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term , there could even be &quot; some hundred thousand , &quot; the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes .
because of the harsh action of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , the Kurdish community expects Germany to be a mass cur@@ ri@@ cher to Germany .
&quot; in short term , I estimate with tens of thousands , medium @-@ term with several hundred thousand protective seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany if the Erdo@@ gan regime has fought the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the World of Friday .
because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government had handed over before the months of Kurdish floods with criminal action , 500,000 Kurds in Turkey were on the run . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the put@@ sch , put@@ sch was still sec@@ ular and op@@ position@@ elle ethnic Turks .
many will begin to re@@ boot in Europe if they continue to be re@@ pressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that assi@@ sts refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chief of Staff , the deliber@@ ate of Syrian Arab , compl@@ ained in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
thus Erdo@@ gan wants to increase trav@@ eler pressure on the remaining Kurds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been cut off or exp@@ ended in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also CD@@ U . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government officials requested that the federal government has positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot;
also in Germany there is an &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan &apos;s critics .
I feel no longer in Germany for the first time in recent months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition .
the fire markings as a Gü@@ len @-@ trailer destroys teachers and other acade@@ m@@ ics to professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever doesn &apos;t fit and Erdo@@ gan is sitting on the packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and Sec@@ ular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the newspaper reports on appeal to the figures of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks had already recognized the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers in Germany before the coup .
as of June 30 , this 11.@@ 386 people and thus nearly 29 per cent of all have been eligible as an example ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , there are not those who are involved in war , poverty or perspectives .
asylum entitled to the Basic Law are politically , therefore by state of government , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where to go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals can get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the tourists from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
by 2021 , the country code will not again take place at the end of the summer holidays , the heavy parliament decided by the beginning of the year .
as stupid as so far it is not : summer holidays , heat and country sessions - that bit@@ es .
the locals who are supposed to be convinced of the fighters are on holiday .
most of the holi@@ day@@ makers who are in the country are on Use@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not the locals , not allowed to choose the country &apos;s day .
these are practical problems : in the holidays there are hel@@ pers that hang on posters , air ballo@@ ons , fl@@ yers and put out at the end of the votes cast out only m@@ üh@@ ev@@ oll .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass over to the people over the people over a day .
the hot stage , if one can say it at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be feared for his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U .
exciting , how strongly new@@ comer AF@@ D cut and what remains left at the end of the coalition .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign , one sees his major posters .
he travels across the country , spread roses and chat@@ ted a little with the people , as it did already his legendary former predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise , seaf@@ ering has received cold feet and is Chancellor Merkel &apos;s fault on the blo@@ om of AF@@ D .
her refugee policy , you &quot; We do &quot; have to accelerate the rise of pop@@ uli@@ sts , which is thought to cost him expected .
the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make the right place for the wrong time .
she has invited two Angela Merkel ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Angela Merkel ; Merkel member in the North East .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as a Mec@@ kl@@ ist and Vorpommern .
&quot; it was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR .
but it is too bad to anyone from Germany &apos;s other corners to listen to Angela Merkel .
apart from that , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U is largely on the usual campaign sites and shopping m@@ alls with paras@@ ols and ballo@@ ons .
that , like Kok@@ ert , plays only one &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ated role . &quot;
also the union has noticed that on the country you need to burn the base it must be very strict , again to find a wire to the people .
you are just like the left , the SPD , the green : in the land of the country barely there is .
however , the Council of the CD@@ U @-@ election fighter Kok@@ ert to his fellow soldier is also self @-@ lar@@ v@@ ingly : &quot; you have to go there where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because there is a lot on the game , Sell@@ ering has inv@@ oked his SPD to a particularly dedicated election campaign .
in p@@ olls , the Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent of partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just under the AF@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election of 2011 , the SPD won still clearly by 3@@ 5.6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , Klein@@ par@@ tei with seven percent in the p@@ olls , will create the leap in the land tag .
they make a modern virtu@@ e of holidays in the holidays of a holiday and transfer their campaigns to the Internet .
&quot; online campaign &quot; is the state president Claudia Müller .
otherwise green election battles on Sp@@ ur@@ ens@@ che to native cru@@ stac@@ eans among the holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ ek , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a hou@@ s@@ ebo@@ at lakes and finds it even beautiful .
your impression : &quot; voting holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a penalty . &quot;
B@@ 27 restructuring : restaurants suffer from lock
at speed , with which the B is 27 , there is nothing to complain .
for those responsible for the construction work , starting at 5.@@ 30 a.m. , and only at 20 o &apos;clock in the morning , there are always praise praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these have made all pretty tender , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ vir@@ a T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff tells of the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no suit too .
at the beginning of October , the construction site could be moved to south towards the south , until the end of October should be finished .
commen@@ ded also the discharge of those responsible for the construction workers , such as it comes to the establishment of heating drives .
since the construction site started on Monday to the south , and also the lock of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ or has returned , the traffic situation became relaxed within the resort .
the citizens can now move from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the transport through the place seems to be back .
&quot; there were partly significant complaints , &quot; says the Deputy Assistant Vice @-@ Manager , Florian King .
the residents of Bach@@ ar Strait , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , o@@ harbour street and consec@@ u@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many shots were sought and rather trusted in their Nav@@ i as the signs .
what led to some trucks in the areas where man@@ ners should be fran@@ ken .
since the speed limit has not been kept , the community strengthened the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were significant convic@@ tions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King who made himself a location on the location . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there have been sl@@ ashed two to three per minute .
the fastest one was on the pace with 77 hour kilometers in the pace @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business people at the B 27 , it is only a small consol@@ ation that customers from Rot@@ tenburg are now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look in the cards .
however , that the B 27 @-@ restructuring has led to revenue in revenues , each one asks you to pass through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
who with the &quot; end customers &quot; has less to do , so for other firms , the renovation could hardly have any consequences .
even at the car deal@@ ership Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; most slight decrease , &quot; but also grants us that of course , the drive was missing . &quot;
the strongest on the road are the local people along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
that is already exist@@ ential .
not only him , but all the restaurants I met &quot; hard . &quot;
the customers of H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil were missing .
we need to be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the net sales tax on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far exceeds 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road conver@@ ge has thrown its operation &quot; for two years . &quot;
he must have dismissed half of his employees .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , the policy would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , government president Jörg Schmidt cited on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , whether it could give a financial compensation to the reference , the inn benef@@ ited by the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now she has to put the dis@@ advantages , which result in the restoration .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other coun@@ ties , where so much more generous has been handled .
with all Kl@@ agen , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his inn will continue .
finally , the family business has been located since 17@@ 15 , he points to the long history of history .
other regul@@ ars may now fail because of the complicated road traffic less frequently , it can understand .
if you can &apos;t ride , it &apos;s also a different way .
after the restoration works by the end of the restoration works , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt .
despite the crises of BSE and avi@@ an flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 construction work on its clientele in the largest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long@@ time history .
construction work , which is already brutal .
constantly , in the name of the terrorist control in laws shall be screw@@ ed .
after recent attacks , the Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a di@@ ck@@ est security package .
but what does a Dul@@ ce status be doing with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all of that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the reconciliation .
all his proposals were politically acceptable , &quot; says the Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs at the presentation of his new security box .
they don &apos;t have to ask anybody .
other , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also took part in it .
however , as the Interior Minister , he was on results and on a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sensus &quot; within the Coalition .
after recent attacks in Würzburg , and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gave a little time , before he presents his conclusions to the Republic &apos;s safety in the Republic .
but these are the more extensive .
a lot is already known , announced that a new security authority is to take care of the cra@@ ck encrypted communication , is not new .
not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU direc@@ tives for passenger data and weapons .
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security agencies are also not surprising .
in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère takes a second call for proposals that have not been done with the SPD : he wants to make sympath@@ etic advertising for terrorist groups under penalty and Ji@@ hadi@@ sts with double citizenship in the German pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U man will dream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still hold this for reasonable and demands nothing , which has no chance at the coalition partner .
a few new ideas are presented by Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they are partly in themselves : it is planning rapid method for shifts and more possibilities to uph@@ old people from deportation .
refugees who are targeted targeted towards the country should open their smartphones and open social media accounts for a security check .
in Dul@@ ce for the past asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to prove some worse than so far - such , the off@@ ences go away or throw away their papers in order to di@@ v@@ ise their identity .
a lot of it is political and legal .
some also works un@@ balanced and makes questions open .
and with some points - in the im@@ itation of gran@@ ul@@ ment for example - the question arises : what does that actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère says it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects of refugees and terror .
but it is not possible to speak in demo@@ stration that the assass@@ in of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
there are also many people in view of the high refugee pay for security .
and things that are deeply busy , had not let themselves out in election campaign times .
the inner security is enormous into the focus .
first stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg , and Ans@@ bach .
the uns@@ afe is great .
and yes , there are election fights .
as a result of inner safety , the Union and SPD become increasingly important in the topic of internal security .
in the past days , it went up between the two parties .
only a gar@@ ris@@ ky dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Unions &apos;s interior ministers in which the Ress@@ ort@@ ch@@ efs also call a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is bo@@ asting a lot of con@@ cili@@ atory notes .
from a return from the double pass , he is nothing .
we have fixed the discussion in Germany .
they re@@ inv@@ aded , don &apos;t be wise .
and with a Bur@@ ka prohibition , he has constitutional concerns .
whether his own package is un@@ constitutional and if it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , must show itself only .
there is a lot to worry about what to worry about .
however , the SPD also attempts to prof@@ ate himself in the topic of inner security .
Part@@ s@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel is only sign@@ aled to a cau@@ tious talk and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to the safety of security . &quot;
Volkswagen still comes heavily by .
despite diesel engines the extradition request rise worldwide .
but not in all markets there is round .
at the return reaction , there is turbul@@ ations for a term .
Volkswagen launches the deliveries in the second half of the year .
despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can continue to offer an increase in the current year despite the diesel engine .
but in July , the core brand VW weak@@ ened especially in Western Europe and thereby resi@@ li@@ ent the total sales as that was held by the D@@ ax .
the VW brand sold its VW brand in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s month .
in Western Europe alone , according to China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month .
in the home market of Germany , deliveries by almost one six@@ teenth .
in July 2013 , Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann &apos;s head of head in Europe brought back to two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , there have been given a purchase back in some key markets through &quot; modified economic conditions . &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote have also been bur@@ dened by the EU , said a speaker .
in the USA , where the exhaust gases are escal@@ ating , there is also a Min@@ us to be@@ ech .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the primarily affected house brand of Lower Saxony is still far@@ med by the diesel sc@@ andal : according to the first seven months , there is only one supplier of 0.9 per cent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles .
consolidated President Fred Kap@@ pler was able to anticip@@ ate sales plans from January to July .
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time , 5,@@ 90@@ 4 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software ab@@ ject testing .
in Germany alone , VW is calling for some 2.5 million vehicles to re@@ armament to the workshops .
in the course of re@@ armament VW , the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after the upgrade of the vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the car@@ makers place the customer after re@@ armament a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but do not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason to be legal hos@@ tilities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now serves its customers a guarantee for re@@ arranged diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed by the Federal Ministry of Transport on Monday last Monday .
out of the state department , it was confirmed that there were meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully fulfil the rules of my investigation Commission and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; dis@@ agreements shall not be accepted , &quot; declared Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry .
VW has adopted the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance after conversion does not take any deteri@@ oration and have all the relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was in corporate travel .
in the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers for example a half a year after the upgrade with a motor damage to a workshop - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
it is also important to avoid the customer &apos;s interest in case of any other damages , which have nothing to do with the g@@ ass@@ ay sc@@ andal , with regard to possible warran@@ ties , as it was called .
therefore VW is not using the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands pen@@ alties in future punishment - as the second Institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank Director Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Federal Association of German Banks speaks of an accident and does not see a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal austerity would have to pay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to pay for their spar@@ k@@ ingly criminal complaint . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
deposit money at night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they need to pay 0.4 % penalty .
the fee required the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund starting September from private and corporate clients for deposits above 100,000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or Day c@@ ash@@ boards .
&quot; the first 100.000 Euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost € 400 in the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has been drinking 40 million euros since a day that could be lifted from one day to the others and could not be able to use it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me in the central bank account and account for 0.4 percent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can not place any million euros for each one million . &quot;
the cost is now subject to the damages principle now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cash flow in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced four accidents , I don &apos;t like to see the fifth ! , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank@@ note . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most clients would have understanding and changed to other investment forms .
only few hi@@ ves to other banks .
the cooperative association Bavaria declared : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB is caused significant costs by all banks . &quot;
they are alone to bear , be &quot; Oper@@ ating economically permanently not possible . &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for conversation , credit cards , or credit transfers .
with pen@@ alties for deposits above three million euros , the Thur@@ ing@@ ian People &apos;s and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger Land has made headlines in 2014 with their sk@@ ate bank branch .
Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive director of the banking association , said : &quot; we are not expecting private consumers to pay attention to deposits , the competition in Germany is much too strong in Germany and savings banks . &quot;
a ban@@ ker said , at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a cliff , which is a little lav@@ ish by the property . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that can be a problem for a small bank if they get free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , G@@ mund established two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ span@@ ol , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
in the region , actors , athletes and entrepreneurs are living in the region .
there are currently no other banks known to the cooperative association Bavaria , &quot; said spokes@@ man for deposits of private customers , &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst .
the President of the Federal Association of the German People &apos;s banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ Banks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , stated at the end of June : &quot; the threshold , to negatives compared to private customers , is very , very high . &quot;
competition was hard , and he dro@@ pping the emig@@ ration of investors to the competition .

destination plates : who does not buy sound plates ?
lon@@ ely men love medium @-@ aged plates .
before you spy on comment , in order to over@@ look him under the p@@ seud@@ onym non @-@ all@@ ele @-@ related people , this statement runs from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the multi@@ tudes of records are not based on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als to welcome the unity of physical objects , but due to mid @-@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record recently , are all pres@@ sive to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely we@@ ath@@ ering group .
it is also not a hor@@ des through hobbies . it has an emotional meaning : older platform seat retain their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it to spend time ( 69 % vs 66 % ) .
but do you agree with the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog was a news report on TV , I would like to follow the camera while in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o run , a humble grey suit and a wild , before I stand , my hands hold and somewhat more determin@@ ant like : &quot; so , let us take a close look . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at them .
even if the heart of So@@ H@@ os slowly stum@@ ble at its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were based - there are still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record shops .
I would probably ask the camera man to turn the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores up and try to estimate their age and mind by observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I think of Sister Ray ( s ) : two young women , three men of middle ages , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of an encounter in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I wonder ?
&quot; I guess already , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 albums .
this records , pictured above ( he has sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed by him ) , dressing up the walls of his residence .
the reason why he possesses such considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : it is now able to buy records , which he could not afford , when she appeared and again sold items that he sold , when he was young and ple@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably had too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is true that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much .
this is my L@@ aster .
We@@ z , 25 who works with Sister Ray , also believes that many customers that he meets , meeting the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he also noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and decided to buy their old records again .
of the talks I have led , people usually were emp@@ t@@ ted by their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers that once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom on the post @-@ revi@@ vals of a specific age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like phon@@ ica to realize that record shops offers a soo@@ thing community of pe@@ ers .
according to We@@ z , some of the older clients participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to withdraw the stability of trusted records covers , of objects , happy ex@@ cre@@ ations .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or property of material poss@@ essions than a kind of consol@@ ation , &quot; says We@@ z .
this is as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal with spirit@@ ually .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; sol@@ dered a staff of a record stack .
a survey conducted by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month they haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the survey was found out that 41 % have a turn@@ table that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , have no turn@@ tables .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried while passing through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comedy .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works with sounds of the Universe ( data , three men of medium @-@ age ) , has noticed a &quot; trop@@ hy &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone just returned here and said , &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I would like to buy a radio record , so I can set it into the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less musician .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no turn@@ tables . &quot;
these are younger people , not older , which only work slowly .
F@@ opp , which has devoted the sound plates almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience , when I go to clean .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and women middle @-@ aged .
even if the atmosphere is something less relaxed than in the af@@ ore@@ mentioned shops , Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s latest syn@@ thesi@@ ology and sex@@ ist packaged pop , instead of experimental jazz , it is good to see such diversity in the customers .
none of them looks strange , but brand psychological trau@@ mat@@ a are badly det@@ ectable if one stands next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for a few minutes in business and looks at the Vari@@ et@@ rack for sale .
it &apos;s more a p@@ addle bum@@ ble@@ bee as a big shopping .
it does not deserve much , therefore , collecting records are not a real option , says it .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from one computer or in other ways , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she drives with a loved sigh@@ s .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of turn@@ lo@@ gi@@ ants : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the certificate that jeans in the pants , I a@@ woke up a group of young teenage girls , who just group for a moment about Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras , before a father and his daughter consider to buy a Cros@@ ley turn@@ tables .
on the left there is a stair@@ case , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essenti@@ als for an average collection .
no one sees them - perhaps because they are just purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to write them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry , and to send some customers to the depths So@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
even though my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , which exist a large number of female collectors and turn@@ tables which exist in reality , turn@@ tables and online .
these people are probably working hard at school or offices .
they spend their Thursday morning not with a bo@@ asting by record shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they reach the stub@@ born ga@@ ze of a unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false present@@ er who rises above the shoulders of nothing aged middle @-@ aged old age .

French court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court has rejected a bid by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live down .
during a trial hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be tra@@ pped in 72 pro@@ vision@@ ally , selling hair services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or easy meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture argued that these places should be broken down because they would not be able to represent a parallel economy , which would not be paid to taxes , and the risk of fire and san@@ ity .
humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups , not sufficient food for growing numbers in the camp would offer .
in addition , they carried out that the provisional shops and restaurants often would offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate 72 temporary businesses , but cleared evidence that the concerns of the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture are absolutely im@@ measur@@ able . &quot;
the judge Jean François M@@ olla said that the food shops , cafes , and restaurants would play a much bigger role than people who live in extremely prec@@ ari@@ ous conditions . &quot;
he said that areas have a quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the precip@@ itation was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is operated and 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as a consulting on asylum causes for the hundreds of vulnerable children in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0.000 people signed the petition to keep the kids &apos; café .
in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure of &quot; for these children were a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years old are . &quot;
the two aid agencies Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated that the number of people in the jungle camp has risen to more than 9.000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase of new@@ com@@ ers throughout the summer .

he doesn &apos;t have a statement for his mis@@ erable twel@@ f@@ th place on the sugar level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am hon@@ estly said to comment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the fut@@ ur@@ istic effect En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example on accident points , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement through the police .
for example , on highway building or to rehabil@@ itated bridges with temporary tem@@ p , there is often no necessary infrastructure to make there with a stationary wind @-@ speed limit for resp@@ ecting the speed limit .
a durable mobile structure can be too dangerous or agile .
the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts for five days when the case data are transmitted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be covered by several tracks at the same time .
variable speed limit as well as drive verb@@ s after time , drive strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in high @-@ prop@@ elled condition one can move the trailer with each car with a trailer hook .
so that it is not simply cl@@ ums@@ y , it is lowered at the measurement mode so that the wheels in the ar@@ mo@@ ths and by the way also sh@@ ank free external gro@@ mm@@ ings disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system will protect the b@@ aker before V@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to information from Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and now also used .
foreign authorities are also fl@@ ashing with the new technology : recently , France offers 100 copies , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain pic@@ ks silver in the 7 @-@ er ru@@ g@@ by after Fiji Master@@ class Gold .
the impressive performance of Britain during the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came to a broken stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were struck with a score of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium in Rio .
in Fiji , a master class in the handling , side step@@ ping , desc@@ ending , line @-@ up and ro@@ her strength to win gold - their first Olympic Medal has any color .
the defeat was disp@@ at@@ ched by the non @-@ poor tro@@ t prize of silver medal - British fourth on that day - and they were able to be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the significant defeat of the bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back to the finals .
but independently of this , in this form , a 15 @-@ man team had been cut in top shape .
it could be a consol@@ ation for GB - but will probably not - that at least one Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is boss Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult way behind .
eight years ago , she lost under Ryan every game at Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this cap is blowing , but the progress is amazing .
in Fiji the attacks of G@@ BS kicked off from fun .
it felt like the captain Tom Mitchell to and Co. to run into driving buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au landed in the corner .
with still four minutes playing time Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack on the right corner , and he turned over .
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely has picked up the ball .
a pre@@ fix T@@ ackle Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but it has only stopped in Fiji .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua had a touch @-@ down in the right corner and it stood at 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new time since the resum@@ p@@ fi@@ ff and there was still about a minute season ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u preached by further weak Tac@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is as if Fiji had been born to play the 7 , while Britain still had to be used .
it is like that .
GB introduced fundamental changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ vian gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fiji .
Dan N@@ orton started a trial for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 but the game went for a long time in favour of the South Korean cons@@ ulate , whose fans sang , sw@@ apping and danced on the tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not hard to admire the play approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ame sat the i dot sne@@ ak with another attempt in the last seconds .
the whi@@ stle were emb@@ ell@@ ished , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and de@@ pl@@ ating the GB in the grass .
earlier on the day in Fiji had defeated Japan in semi @-@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 defe@@ ats and Britain defeated a half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan N@@ orton broke the line with an impressive foot and scored a gate to the post in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony the English 15 @-@ axis teams , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired the fight with the cancer of the trainer .
there will be no more engine gold than with these games , and that will be hot .
from the first stroke of up to the last , 220 hard h@@ ieve , who go into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in her golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only those who were sitting at the rod , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was more present than they were invited to the second Olympic champion in the branch without tax woman , the first women in the history of the British sport that put on such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolute , at least their 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ lag@@ ged use , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant athl@@ ete , who gli@@ mp@@ se on the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ings , which does not reflect the type of tri@@ um .
behind every gold in rowing is a batt@@ ali@@ on to helping hel@@ pers who make the difference , and there was no one remedy than the coach who would survive 30 months ago if he was diagnosed this day when cancer was diagnosed .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer who is oper@@ able and they did .
if you do not do it , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could begin treatment in early 2014 , out of season , beginning to start a minimum , in case that is the correct term under such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go better again soon .
it was an incen@@ tive .
I was at the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be sufficient .
that is how it begins .
the rowing is already a challenge , but that makes it a greater challenge .
in the in@@ ability of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams who spent a ner@@ able morning doing something more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
St@@ anning who was in use as a leader in the Royal Artill@@ ery regim@@ ent in Afghanistan , &quot; I used this week an emotional wreck . that &apos;s maybe something extrem@@ ly , but it means so much . &quot;
it is repeated only , how much I mean , how much I and Helen and also have worked with Robin .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we wouldn &apos;t have anything , therefore a massive thanks go to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I would have no better person for coaching or better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost any race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents didn &apos;t help .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to stop , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Helen called &quot; stay in the process , unle@@ ash in the process . &quot;
it is really important to get rid of itself .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not doing something ra@@ bies .
we wanted no fireworks today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race , what we did .
the couple will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , her own with TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
that would have too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to realize that I am a Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
for 31 years , exemplary for clarity
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ emeyer group , &quot; Ru@@ pe@@ es G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring .
the association is considered as &quot; bay@@ ern@@ al &quot; exemplary . &quot;
a small rural drinking water @-@ purpose organization as a model for the large water producers .
it was the name of the Bavarian Radio a few days ago .
a little later , the water@@ forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia rejected the ken@@ nel .
the work of the voting group &quot; bay@@ ern@@ widely considered exemplary . &quot;
behind all this Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , which was a member of the age of 31 , is 28 years as managing director .
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose group with headquarters in Kot@@ t@@ endorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , promotes approximately 150@@ 000 cubic metres of water and supplies 32 places and ham@@ let with about 5500 residents .
affili@@ ations are the churches of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of B@@ aun@@ ach .
there are water suppliers for further cities and communities .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Mayor of Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , re@@ minded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was hired as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed managing director of the Zw@@ eck@@ association in 1988 .
&quot; its tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and maintenance activities , the budget plans , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency posts on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as an exceptional events , it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new well ( 1994 ) , land in the area of the new well ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the renovation of the high containers ( 1999 ) , the new production of a central computer @-@ control ( 2004 ) and the particles of water pipes .
there was no breast@@ feeding and we have always received innovations , because water , cover and drinking water is the most important food .
in their eu@@ ph@@ atio , they praised Gö@@ llers loyal , reliable and accurate service for over 31 years .
he was employed with plenty of heart blood for his water@@ purpose and he has lived quite well with the water @-@ purpose organization , as if it would be his own company .
a few weeks ago , he was able to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ emeyer group for the nit@@ rat@@ ern@@ ity in front of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia District .
he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller ( on the other hand , lau@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked together for 28 years with him .
he is the best water keeper and he was a faithful button .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point he described the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the re@@ structure of the self @-@ restoration .
but the most difficult task and the most difficult use were the burst of pipe at the Kirch@@ lou@@ der on a 3rd of January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night , so that the villages could be supplied with water .
even the supply of Neu@@ brunn , too , have to be maintained only because one filled the container vessel of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hat@@ ching .
the management of pot@@ able water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer by Lau@@ ter , who performs the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
the Sop@@ rano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko goes openly with the au@@ tism of their son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; you must have the courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the medicine made great progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 44 year old of the Italian paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Corriere della Sera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the illness had been recognized by her son , they believed that they should die .
however , the eight @-@ year old Ti@@ ago was well ahead and now learn private in New York , where it was the best therapist .
&quot; to give an example : if I am asking him something for two years , when I sang at the Mail@@ änder Scala , he remembers nothing , &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko said .
but he &apos;s the happ@@ i@@ est person on earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ reb@@ k@@ os connection with the bass bar@@ it@@ one Er@@ win Sch@@ rott .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man sho@@ ots in je@@ op@@ end@@ ary
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man injured his partner in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 am and wounded them fatal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called himself with us and stated to have killed his lifetime champion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rators are on the run , and after him I will be public@@ ised .
meanwhile , nationwide , because Sven S. could be travelling by car .
the man is about 1.@@ 80 m tall , muscular , brown and has a glass .
meanwhile the police has released a photo of him .
it is , however , a few years old .
meanwhile the man we@@ ars a glass .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still bear the weapon in itself , so the police .
whoever sees Sven S. is supposed to call the 110 .
the police speaks of a &quot; relationship at . &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rators in 1981 .
the responsible police in Lü@@ beck did not want to do any data to the T@@ ather@@ pass or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims ; but it confirmed that a man had been killed .
&quot; it concerns a kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; we do not say more &quot; at the moment , &quot; a police officer said in Lü@@ beck .
according to witnesses , a special police force ( SEK ) was at the crime scene .
steel - light view for the steel industry
the risk @-@ exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains un@@ spar@@ ed by additional cost in million@@ enh@@ öhe .
financial bur@@ dens , which are threatened by the industry from the green power promotion , are from the table .
it remains in the liberation of renewable energy conversion at the inventory of the so @-@ called pow@@ erh@@ rom@@ atic production in the German steel industry , the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , said the &quot; West German General Newspaper &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really glad that we could finally achieve the negotiations for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the European Commission , the European Commission designed the steel producers to use gases from the high @-@ furnace for power generation to ask cash for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry has additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the W@@ AZ , there is now a certificate of certification with the EU Commission to talks with competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only if generators will be replaced in the steel works , an EEG circum@@ stance of 20 percent will be replaced .
but even these will not be le@@ vi@@ ed in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission to qualify for the owner of the European Commission .
thus the status quo of the previous control has been fixed .
special significance have the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; steel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the future is the first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more you have to follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also at the reform of the emission level , climate and employment aims are &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; IG Metall CEO Jörg Hofmann explained in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry has been suffering under over@@ capacity and considerable pressure .
last year , the situation intensi@@ fied , as the world &apos;s largest producer in China , in view of the weak@@ est domestic demand , designed steel to the global market .
European manufacturers t@@ oss Chinese steel corporations d@@ umping .
in the course of this spring , the situation has relaxed .
for one show , import tari@@ ffs on imp@@ orter effects , for others , the economic prospects in China have risen up .
how sustainable is the price of recovery .
the German industry pri@@ m Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
finally the prices were stagn@@ ated again .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp has finally decided to not exclu@@ de certain works of individual works .
at the end of 2015 , around 8@@ 6000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July , German steel manufacturers remain cau@@ tious despite increasing prices and increasing orders .
they produced by 3.4 million tons , roughly six percent less steel than in the previous year &apos;s , like economic unification steel on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the amount returned to each other in the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
the association ends in the coming months thanks to an increasing order volume in the coming months .
community , Spirit , Health : sing sen@@ iors Good
the singing has already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , she finished the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sing me - emotional and physically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she describes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and altogether lively , she says .
at the same time , she does something good with her health and spirit .
for singing is like a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler by the German senior league .
most sen@@ iors are singing in chor@@ us and sharing the joy of music , H@@ ac@@ kler describes .
through regular interaction , senior citizens can slip and maintain social contacts .
because frequently social and family structures often solve the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to address and organize , learn to learn and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of awareness . &quot;
singing can be ti@@ ring in the positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler mean .
for doing , senior citizens train a deep and controlled resp@@ i@@ ration .
anyone who calls his lungs regularly , unit not so fast in everyday life .
even though it comes to maintain the sound of voice at age , singing is an optimal hobby .
elderly people often have a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz says from the Federal Employment Service of the Seniors organizations .
in the older generations the joint singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure , she explains .
l@@ enz frequently observed that singing or listening of songs in older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
by song lyrics and particularly melodies den@@ ies themselves in dist@@ ressed people at long @-@ lying events .
when singing , a special achievement is required , L@@ enz explains .
at the same time , focusing on its own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a major cog@@ nitive challenge .
just older people who live alone , don &apos;t just want to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through the singing in choir , H@@ ac@@ kler mean .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
even the self @-@ este@@ em is growing through the singing in choir .
to show themselves : if I do so long for something , I will get better and watch over me - this experience .
good reasons to start singing with singing , so there is enough .
those who want to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even when he means little talent , advis@@ es L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 sin@@ ks people , who is listening to it when a tone is next ?
in search of the appropriate offer , Seniors various possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if anyone sings of the reputation in a veter@@ an ench@@ or , you can just join them .
many cities also offer views over the cho@@ irs in the surroundings .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church .
many veter@@ in@@ ench@@ irs can also be found on the Internet .
whoever does not have access to the Internet , can ask the family , friends or neighbors for help in the Internet .
who wants to sing , should necessarily connect to a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does the soul well and has something ad@@ orable - that applies to every age .
cats react sensi@@ tively as male k@@ ater on scre@@ ams
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , what effect the rest of cat bab@@ ys on adult animals has .
at their surprise , the male didn &apos;t get cold . however , they kept the difference to the females always straight away .
female cats may recognize the level of cat@@ tery bab@@ ys at the sho@@ cks of the little ones .
they react by ten percent faster at Lau@@ te of K@@ itt@@ ens who have found herself in great emergency , such as scientists from the Department of Animal Sciences and the Medical University of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
K@@ ater also respond to the loop of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always equal .
&quot; evi@@ dently the acoustic differences between the building of less and heavily polluted young men for the males either are not per@@ cep@@ tible or not meaning , &quot; said the biolog@@ ist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H .
it is the first director of the study published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; on this Friday .
in a previous study the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the K@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ ams was different with the ur@@ gency of her assistance .
a total of nine adult male and eight cavi@@ ties were observed from the MH@@ H livestock hus@@ k .
they were previously played by little ones , who were taken from the litter box for three minutes , and were separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
in other cases , they were faced with scre@@ aming of stronger k@@ itt@@ ens , which were elevated in addition .
the researchers hold their results despite the low sample for meaningful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who did not have their own offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ am , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to the loud@@ speaker , when this ra@@ fe played the very rainy k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may be re@@ born or developed with sexual maturity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males responded to all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the biolog@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby sounds .
also , some studies showed that women re@@ acted sensitive to infants , whether they were already mothers or not , reported the biolog@@ ist of Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued in Turkey against the ru@@ sty football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after Putin &apos;s attempt , Turkey will take place once again in Turkey .
before the Du@@ el of the Arch@@ rival between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official name : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
already in the suspension of acceptance after the overthrow in July , the government , the everyday life of norm@@ alities should not be imp@@ aired .
this does not apply to those who are suspected to belong to the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the attempt of Putin .
it is also not done prior to football .
against the earlier launch of Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r , the prosecutor &apos;s office announced an arrest warrant .
in the meantime , he is accused of being accused of being a terrorist group of terrorist groups in America .
Sü@@ kis@@ ses should be followers of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan .
true , the initial state for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact , the lives of most Turks , however , does not affect the life of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country , Erdo@@ gan declared on Wednesday for an end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like all the country - split into followers and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the working class Bes@@ ik@@ tas are not one of the friends of the president .
but what the Turks of the Turks , given dramatic experiences in history , is the strict re@@ jection of military coup .
they even agree on the fans - no matter whether their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
at Po@@ kal@@ sieger &quot; Gala , &quot; it will be back on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski again .
the Köl@@ ner &apos;s sporty value introduced the Köl@@ ner in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitors , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as a top@@ sc@@ orer of his corporation .
in the final match against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce he achieved the 1 : 0 victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fan@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celebrated it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the trop@@ hy in his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the dis@@ appo@@ inting season for the record master took an extraordinary conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; came out early in the Europe League .
in the South of Li@@ g , it was only six .
the season was not good .
the trop@@ hy was the only way to win something .
&quot; we managed it and this is the most important thing , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski .
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the year was better .
above all , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who made the base with 26 seasonal sw@@ ings as the South @-@ Li@@ g por@@ ter , the base for the 14th title .
this is also the reason that fans continue to return to the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
at the same time , the AC Florence , under contract standing and Bes@@ ik@@ tas had only returned to the coup attempt to return , because of the political situation in the country after his Euro @-@ holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario want to come to us , he only must say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club chef F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would have to be willing to ren@@ ounce around one @-@ third of its annual salary for an estimated 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite d@@ oping : these athletes still have medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Justin Gat@@ lin had been locked twice already due to d@@ oping ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ s in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa can not start in Rio .
others of light @-@ athle@@ tics sin@@ ens can laugh about it - they are fighting in Rio to medals .
the theme d@@ oping was determined by the headlines at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
the Russian swi@@ mmer in Juli@@ ja J@@ eph@@ im@@ owa , who , after a d@@ oping lock , had entered her first right in front of the games , was mer@@ cil@@ essly ext@@ ented with her start ( 100 meters of breast ) .
it offered a quir@@ ky scene : with a set smile she was still proud in the hall and prov@@ oked her appearance .
as determined that it won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a junk@@ yard .
but there are also many other sports@@ men who go to the Rio Olympics despite d@@ oping @-@ past .
here is an overview :
Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staffel / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .

Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian woman wounded - several dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stood up with the woman in contact , said the spokesperson for Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
they have been afflicted and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it again .
she plans her hom@@ ebo@@ und voyage to the beginning of September .
whether from further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ uk@@ et as well as in the southern towns of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on are also affected by Austrian citizens , is still un@@ clear .
the Department of Foreign Affairs stood in in@@ surg@@ ent contact with local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
in approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , Hua H@@ in initially explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening in a Nightlife .
according to the police , a Thai @-@ change was killed and about 20 people were injured , among them the Austrian woman , three Germans , three countries and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning , another two spar@@ row sets went up again , and , according to the authorities , another man was killed .
Ph@@ uk@@ et was also a bomb explosion in the morning .
during the det@@ onation near the popular bathing beach Pat@@ ong was inj@@ ected by a taxi driver after police specifications .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb that killed a municipal worker .
according to the authorities in a flower be@@ et , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in front of the Re@@ four of the coastal police .
finally , determin@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south west coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on at the south @-@ east coast several wounded .
from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , it was named .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb quotes carry the same manuscript , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army @-@ ener@@ al Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday night before journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express themselves as possible motives - but most likely , however , in order to make the deeds of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks which is typical for the bombing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , however , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist insur@@ gency movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local Sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited territories and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , one assumes that the bombs of the ruling military jun@@ ta was laid .
the authorities have received secret notes on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed of the exact date and the places .
still be un@@ clear , which group behind the attacks .
the police rejected their officials throughout the country to strengthen the safety of important government buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment area .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ans , but they usually do not care against tourists .
Hua H@@ in is a palace that has been used by King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j in Hua H@@ in .
after the reason of bomb explo@@ sions the Austrian Foreign Ministry is recommen@@ ding to ensure the instructions of Thai security agencies .
high level of security ( safety level 3 ) for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its surroundings .
after disp@@ utes between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no need of travel in these provinces .
increased safety risk ( safety level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
a few days after a controversial referendum on Thursday and Friday , a referendum held by the military jun@@ ta worked out .
this dream the military as well as in the coming years .
Jun@@ ta leader and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said the bombs have been an attempt to dress chaos , while the country is moving towards stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , who in 2014 had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , the kingdom holds itself to stability and order .
however , the military has not succeeded in getting a grip for years in the extreme south of the country in the extreme south of the country .
in the conflict , more than 6@@ 500 people were killed .
in addition to a year ago , Bangkok in Bangkok were killed at a popular Hindu shr@@ ine 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t assault of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is entered in the Vis@@ ier of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection .
after several state offices , the Con@@ prot@@ ector has also placed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see at the &apos; Identi@@ fication Movement &apos; Princip@@ al for const@@ ancy against the Freedom Party Democratic Party , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Supreme Leader Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate from the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , immigrants will be diff@@ used by the Middle East or the Middle East in extrem@@ ist manner .
therefore we watch the movement as well .
the &quot; identity movement &quot; is a group of group@@ ing with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 .
it turns against &quot; mul@@ ticul@@ tur@@ key , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass emig@@ ration , &quot; and the &quot; loss of its own identity . &quot;
constitutional prot@@ ectors in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - observe the &quot; identity . &quot;
Ma@@ at said , his authority has voted in favour with the state offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &apos; identity movement &apos; attempt to collect their target group , where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Treaty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts , to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the daily Islam@@ ists as well as the right extreme .
this is no bet@@ u@@ able advertising for your own cause .
propaganda is supposed to address the people emotional .
young people are due to sus@@ cep@@ tible in particular .
this is dangerous .
recently it was given by several federal states and reports of &quot; identity &quot; to AF@@ D politicians .
Ma@@ ate said , he did not have any evidence .
for the constitutional protection , this species will only be relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the AF@@ D - by certain people , the extrem@@ ist , alters and so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is , whether such individuals contributed to the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
with a view to the significant increase in lawful off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee camps , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new rights in this context .
but in recent years , we found that there can be right @-@ mort@@ al structures in recent years .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it may well be that further tim@@ el@@ ism groups or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee houses or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a clear or pan @-@ wide control of jus@@ tic@@ r@@ or@@ ism is not recogni@@ zable .
the previous groups were created at regional level or in social networks .
Ma@@ at &apos;s worried about that many gra@@ dients were involved in the account of people who had not been involved in the right scene before .
this is the wor@@ rying .
many of the Tat@@ ar attacks on asylum seek@@ ers were not known as criminal , politically motivated off@@ ender or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed off@@ ences that were not politically in@@ different with the right @-@ wing , which might have been politically in@@ different , or for example , CD@@ U , SPD or Left , who , however , have been radic@@ alised by the right @-@ wing extremis@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a back@@ drop of 48 seconds and reserved the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather not his sporty figure , which attracted the attention of the international media .
why does the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still participate in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian received a special launch of the international water association .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub@@ woo@@ ded countries .
because in Eth@@ op@@ ia most athletes walk , Hab@@ te just wanted to do something else .
preparations are all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
they made the first nickname for the first time .
some media reported it as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of the whale . &quot;

the 22 @-@ year @-@ old spent eight months before Olympia , and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump does not see the dro@@ pping electoral system not so tight
Republican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump talks on a election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing to become US president , Donald Tr@@ ump already has a Alternative vide@@ oc@@ e .
he then went into the holiday .
losing Donald Tr@@ ump won the US presidential elections in November , it would be no matter : &quot; ultimately it will be , or I have a very very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in a telephone interview with the US television channel CN@@ BC .
if it is not good for him , for reasons of political correc@@ t@@ ness that is fine , he said b@@ ump .

within his party , more resistance formed .

an electric vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other firms in the field is apparently great .
the post office plans to sell its electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter .
shortly , the Group wants to launch trade with the transp@@ orters .
the post office aims to offer its electric transporter starting from the coming year also on the free market .

Ger@@ z announced that the Group wants to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars , and have a complete conversion to the environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we surround the entire fleet .

GfK tour joins dis@@ appo@@ inting financial figures
the consumer research company GfK meets his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the returned appearances are suddenly - but not surprisingly .
the difficult position of the market research entrepren@@ e@@ uri@@ al GfK contributed that Matthias Hart@@ mann &apos;s chair is unbe@@ atable , the longer the success of his success will remain .

the Executive Board took part in the Executive Board for September 1 , the previous board member , Gerhard Haus@@ bu@@ inger , shared the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is supposed to take over the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CEO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to meet a successor for Hart@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company called &quot; different views &quot; for long @-@ term employment alignment .
details wanted to call a company on Friday .
whoever will in future be le@@ ad@@ here to the market research company , is still un@@ clear .
in annex@@ ing circles it was on Friday at the shareholders &apos; dis@@ appointment over the continued successes which had been re@@ structured before years ago .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at GfK @-@ tip since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of the restructuring , however , are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was named . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last bad GfK @-@ business numbers , each shareholder may be un@@ quiet at some point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the case was in BMW , it would also be the quota . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after set@@ backs , the company could not stop losing its losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales increased by 6.1 percent below the level of the year @-@ earlier quarter .
relative to the first half of the year , sales of 72@@ 1.2 million euros decreased by 3.4 percent .
earnings in the second quarter were particularly bur@@ dened by the company &apos;s su@@ cking value in view of its difficult economic situation .

accidents - Bus sli@@ pping in cr@@ ushes in tren@@ ches : eight injured parties
eight people were injured during an accident of a travel with 43 sen@@ iors as a road@@ map ( County Aur@@ um ) .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injury , the police divided .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to ev@@ ade their information , according to an oppos@@ ing L@@ aster , partly on the road@@ way .
the bus arrived right away from the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch like a speaker of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the location of the bus , people couldn &apos;t leave the bus no longer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade delivered the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and ambul@@ ances came to the accident at the State Road 2 .
the un@@ last trav@@ eler were brought back to the town of P@@ ew@@ sum by a liner bus .
there they should wait for a spare bus of the travel business .
the investig@@ ators demanded the truck @-@ experienced and possible witnesses to report on the police force .
the fees per cubic meters are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ th@@ igh 3,@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euros ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf the se@@ wer@@ age fee will then be increased later than once again , if appropriate improvement is necessary .
according to a relevant calculation , the san@@ itation price in Az@@ endorf will be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser reported ( CS@@ U ) , the approval of the budget was determined by the Office of the Office of Kul@@ mb@@ ach for these se@@ wage plants .
the Market Kas@@ endorf is oblig@@ ated due to the correct foundation to cover the facilities .
from 1 October 2016 , the citizens and the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ th@@ igh , Neu@@ dorf , re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg have to attack deeper into the pur@@ se .
the rate increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Head of Herbert Schmidt &apos;s Board of Directors , a new cal@@ cal@@ ulation of the fees for the se@@ wage plant was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , there are also overseas and covers from the previous calendar period .
in order to establish the excav@@ ators increases , Schmidt settled in all three se@@ wer@@ age facilities around relatively small establishments with a very low wage waste , which fly between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic metres per year .
thus , due to the low distribution system , expenses for the repair of several thousand Euros would be gra@@ c@@ eful .
in addition , the se@@ wer@@ age is slightly decl@@ ining in all three plants .
furthermore , in the back@@ drop period in all three systems were not least reported due to its age of san@@ itation and repair applications in a substantial extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for cat@@ tery , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp .
Schmidt pointed out that at the se@@ wer@@ age of Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage .
at the p@@ umping station , the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and in the pond @-@ stop L@@ opp , after almost 20 years , the first se@@ wage treatment is dischar@@ ged , the se@@ wage s@@ lu@@ dge is disp@@ osed and an additional aer@@ ation facility can also be installed in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenditure came into account for these extraordinary expenditure and maintenance costs , which are considered to be considered in the new calendar period . &quot;
same applies to electricity costs associated with the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 clearly below the current level .
stone houses made it clear that in the low wage waste in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance &quot; is fully en@@ forced . &quot;
in this case , Schmidt added , the market congregation of great entertainment costs remained in the past 20 years .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned plants will continue to remain pre@@ st@@ enti@@ ary , especially since it can &apos;t be extended the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al tank for these systems because it is about de@@ fied facilities .
Bulgaria - for the first time in 8 months of inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July 1 .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October of last year , when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average income of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after the CP@@ I -@@ 0,8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) amounted to -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation amounted to -@@ 0.2 % in July 2015 .
in July 2016 , a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods were observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1,2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell by clothes and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances , and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
the prices remained as in pre @-@ mon@@ at in alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; and education remains unchanged .
snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as an Asian caric@@ ature critic@@ ises
snap@@ chat says that this filter anim@@ e @-@ inspired is , but some ob@@ servers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filter tool , it enables Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and with identi@@ ties based on such a way that borders the absurd .
you can turn into an pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are un@@ bl@@ asted , independent tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ appearances arrive at the public .
snap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in the past , when they were accused that the app would be propag@@ ated Black@@ face or the white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week some Us@@ ers proposed a filter which gave them sl@@ ot@@ au@@ sts , false teeth and ev@@ ap@@ oration , some critics called a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ low@@ ly . &quot;
they asked whether this repeated controversy raised to a larger issue , that the company has vers@@ atility with diversity .
the news and the indig@@ nation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after snap@@ chat shared it would have been de@@ activated .
the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended as a homage to anim@@ e @-@ characters and not as a cartoon by Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism , rec@@ alled the filter to hurt c@@ lich@@ és .
other rejected the Ani@@ me comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ ets were widely used to spread the photos that the filter was &quot; hur@@ ting and emp@@ tied . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the counter@@ position of a very conflic@@ ting Asian caric@@ ature and the filter effect .
it shows that the filter is non @-@ sigh@@ ted , but that the yellow @-@ sigh@@ ted extreme was drawn into the extreme .
snap@@ chat is not the only company that this cultural revival was crossed .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices , which we all keep in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are pregnant as their older oppos@@ ers - could rather be expected to expect sensitivity .
if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats felt a picture , it is much more difficult for a user to remain un@@ noticed when it was the case earlier , &quot; said the 25 year old K@@ atie Z@@ hu on an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu chose Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer to delete their snap@@ chat account , asked others to do the same .
in a essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that she believed that r@@ ents @-@ related controversy has a lack of diversity in the action practices near snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu had critic@@ ised the big part of white , only male leaders and finishing its attachment with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either I have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chin@@ ese US @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions in which they are safe or comfortable to say what to say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the snap@@ chat mostly left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish numbers on diversity of its workforce , and points to its status as a private enterprise .
on Thursday the Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his collabor@@ ators , but according to a speaker , the company has recently addressed a personnel responsible , which focused on sub@@ ordin@@ ated population groups and internal integration efforts .

military members of the United States Central Command changed re@@ direc@@ ting information to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria as it allowed the actual circumstances on site , reported a meeting of the Congress in a report on Thursday .
the provisional report , created by a Task Force of the republi@@ can members of the disp@@ oss@@ al members of the Supreme Court , reports on major dis@@ satisfaction at Central Command Secret Services who reported that their ass@@ essments on the US efforts were defeated in the fight against the Islamic State .
central Command , shortly C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; message distance information provided by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ missions , recorded regularly a posi@@ tional picture of the American efforts against terrorism as it had allowed the actual circumstances on site and were consistent more positive than analysis of other news services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republican member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership error in Cent@@ Com are sufficient until the top point of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed issues in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government agencies have given orders to change reports , it shows how analysts saw the pressure from their pre@@ laws , an optimized picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or Isi@@ l .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , opinions and statements prior to the Congress were clearly more positive than it represents the facts . &quot;
for example , Cent@@ Com was publicly known that a military return of Mos@@ sulph@@ ur could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , second largest city in Iraq , continues under control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigations , it &apos;s so clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republican Congress of Kansas , in a statement .
from the middle of 2014 until the middle of 2015 , the tips of Central Command working the down@@ stream reports to play the danger by ISIS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force to live after them , analysts were worried about manipulation of reports about the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by detailed insights during the investigation .
additionally , further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Defence Ministry .
Democratic members of the news conference published on Thursday their own findings agreed with some of the Republican Task Force conclusions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created a superior process for the creation of re@@ direc@@ ting ass@@ essments on Isi@@ l and Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given the highest level of Democ@@ rat in the Committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this process , so Mr. Schiff , &quot; was delayed the publication of re@@ direc@@ ting reports , &quot; abol@@ ished the mor@@ ality under analysts and &quot; gave a little space for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no evidence of an intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st in regard to a certain political opinion . &quot;
preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
in August , the New York Times reported investigations by investig@@ ators of the Pentagon , who were accepted following complaints by Cent@@ Com analysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press brief@@ ing of the Pentagon , announced in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress while the investigations of the General Assembly could still be underway .
but he also believed that &quot; experts are sometimes for@@ g@@ able opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that the Intelligence and Defence Ministry have a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have continued re@@ perc@@ ussions about the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a asser@@ tion which is now made by a growing number of relatives of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the alleg@@ ations of last year , however , have raised the question in which President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other regions .
the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State recall the disp@@ utes of more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ Com analyst , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , fore@@ seen a scrip@@ ture in Iraq and saw a little time on the occasion of ob@@ jection to the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insur@@ rection against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team surrounding Mr. Hoo@@ ker claims to announce that contrary to the statements of the government against the terrorist state of the terrorist group , there would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these pro@@ vision@@ ally refin@@ eries were put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
however , this realization was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legisl@@ ature for his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US is winning four @-@ fourth match in the hockey field of women , a show@@ down with the UK .
one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said it could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to people who keep their goals in memory .
this is what they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place that un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last round of the first round .
both teams have qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which the two teams will reach the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first placed competition is going to be a little bit longer from the way to the other group .
as always , the game is going out on Saturday , the Americans triggered a surprising thing about their success story , four years after they landed in the last London games on the last of 12 squares .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey ra@@ cket in hands ( their two older sisters played the Sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the National Champion of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , as they could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , where she and her team went wrong .
in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things for better .
&quot; a cultural change , an mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the working time in London we have now .
we &apos;ve got the ru@@ d@@ der completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the tor@@ ches in the first half of the game with a set@@ back .
India was without victory in the tournament , but the team showed up surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
it took a Sprint with a flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and lu@@ te the ball into the gate to make a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the ke@@ epers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in any of the previous games .
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , Zen of the Tramp@@ ol@@ ins
wherever you are , as late as it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel durable and in@@ escap@@ able , a fast @-@ pac@@ ed relay between competition and streams .
it is as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning rod , which is promoted by Armb@@ ru@@ st@@ inate for Turner to tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t listen to the TV , read a newspaper , or listen to your neighbors in the coffee shop without talking about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ cover@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there are Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a gy@@ ms with dimples , could definitely have been under this known name , built for Prime Time , built by sponsors and well @-@ being @-@ on @-@ TV advertising , if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even F@@ ill .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame doesn &apos;t lit every event .
further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognised : air@@ pist@@ ons shoot , ar@@ chery , bad@@ minton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always swim the breast and let it rule long .
but if I should make a modest arguments to my particular favor@@ ites , let me direct your attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline .
although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines have been a Olympic event ever since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it became apparent over the last 16 years so many that I asked , did not know that it is a Olympic port@@ art .
this could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
although the USA sent athletes to the competition , it has never won a medal in the tramp@@ ol@@ ines and until 2012 had a athl@@ ete who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prizes for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for the women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal in London this year .
the trampoline jumping has a certain external side charm , partly because it sounds for the un@@ checked ear , suitable for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ nursery than for the Olympic Games .
at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a feast of enthusiasm .
it has humor@@ ously potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous tre@@ mor of his never @-@ going ast@@ ray - but also the Gra@@ zie of the Turn@@ around and diving , the two sports that combines it essentially .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , meaning a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
asp@@ iring winner jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and must landing a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ real and sal@@ aries ) before they landing at the feet .
they are evaluated according to the official Olympi@@ ad after execution , difficulty , and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts hopes to continue in their quest for gold , faster , upwards and over , sometimes up to the destination , sometimes go and back , upwards and down at the playground .
they hunt only the finish line or the output wall , but in the TV @-@ transmission also another great goal : the world or the Olympic @-@ ords .
the targeted pursu@@ it is no@@ bel , admi@@ red , even fan@@ atically - and it is enough to touch even a spect@@ ator .
but it is also what I experienced during these games as a little ti@@ res@@ ome .
the trampoline offers a breathing spell .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines is top .
a down@@ ward movement is not the goal .
he or she pr@@ all@@ ish , seem@@ ingly heavy as an ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes upward , then down to the top , then effort@@ lessly return to the top .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty but during practice there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wolves ra@@ ve into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant up@@ lifting of time and gravity .
it &apos;s so Zen as the competition can only be with the Olympic Games .
the qualification and final results of the women will be held on Friday afternoon , at the Streaming about 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also around 13.00 .
NBC will radi@@ ate the end as part of a afternoon blocks of two days at 14.00 .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one who probably will see in general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if consciousness increases only through the anxiety and objec@@ tivity of male athletes - as it proposed the male US Turner , according to The Wall Street Journal , Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his to be a new fan@@ base .
&quot; a generation protest &quot; in Ethiopia , Long one of the USA
violent protest in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters and the political changes in Ethiopia are calling for the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that zig prot@@ esters during the cl@@ ashes with polic@@ emen were killed .
is Ethiopia straight together ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ban of West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the past few months protests against the government shook the country and spread themselves in more areas .
last week thousands of people fell on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s response was in@@ merciful to human rights organisations .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot dead prot@@ esters and killed .
in circulation , videos on the protests , probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security experts young people have to strike with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall .
the chief of the UN authority for human rights requires an incoming investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to hold this country and in future it will even become more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the leader of the Horn of Africa from the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country of Africa and its stability is estimated to be the West .
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror across the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable temp@@ o .
its infrastructure has dras@@ tically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been reduced , being dis@@ sent@@ encing to silence .
many were sent into exile , or imprisoned in prison , or driven into the wilderness of the wilderness .
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t have other options to protest out , it breaks out , &quot; said Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ian .
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation are prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints , which cover everything from land use up to appreciation in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
after a widespread election last year , the ruling party and its allies have received the last seat of the Opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , vol@@ tages along the border to Eritrea ; a struggle for this z@@ ack@@ y , disputed line required hundreds of life in June .
analysts believe that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which were forced more or less forced in recent years , could use turbul@@ ence and could be armed .
several factors explain why feelings of pro@@ vocation after years before H@@ ink@@ u@@ ck@@ les were explo@@ ding under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate via the social media , since cheaper smartphones have always been more common and the internet services improved .
even if the government has closed access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially in protests , do many people still talk about Internet Pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ians found that they were so much assembled at the protests .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since e@@ ons prosp@@ ering the Am@@ har@@ as , the predominantly Christian countries come from the Ae@@ gean sea , in politics and economy , while they live the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and in low@@ lands .
but this also changes .
&quot; we are here to coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos .
the largest protests were held in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which account for around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , in the secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was sentenced to death for 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister until his death in a non @-@ public disease in 2012 .
he was viewed as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was especially united in it , to perceive early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and use special assigned to process opponents and make them harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is missing on this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analyst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected for relatively unknown reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of the Northern Ethiop@@ ian , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts say that he can &apos;t enjoy the trust of the Tig@@ ray controlled security services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had such an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands against elections were prot@@ ested by the government , who , according to data , was apparently stolen by the government and stolen away afterwards .
during the following ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if it were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their visionary infrastructure , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for their measur@@ able progress in poverty .
but obviously this does not prevent Inten@@ si@@ fication of the internal mis@@ conception of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month the prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , a Jama@@ ican city , owned by Tig@@ ray and hatred toward the Tig@@ ray will always become more common in social media .
analysts say that protests the US and other Western allies bring into an independent position .
the US government used Ethiopia as a basis for dem@@ nity over the neighboring Somalia , even if they were recently closed that it closed the basis .
while the West wants to support democracy clearly , he doesn &apos;t want his bund@@ le in a already volatile area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin gr@@ at@@ ration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim that Obama was founded &quot; Sar@@ kas@@ mus &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to sc@@ atter the last controversy on Friday that his campaign claims that his several times repeated claim , President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State .
this clari@@ fication threw new questions on the communication skills of the Presi@@ dential candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans to see whether he was able to communicate with the American public .
it also brings his fel@@ low@@ soldier , who endeav@@ oured to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , in the formal position , which he could not mean .
after he had made the suggestion for a election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump answered in terms of the asser@@ tion on Thursday and existed in interviews that he really didn &apos;t intend to indicate the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but in an early morning Twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was just s@@ ark@@ astic .
contrary to the previous day Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely seriously .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ o@@ der@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to re@@ lie@@ ve the testimony that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the republi@@ can candidate wanted nothing to know about it .
the last storm of criticism fell down to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tried to direct his campaign to direct economic conditions on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches to the business situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this issue .
commenting on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ ton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes , and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July , he attracted strong criticism when he said that the Russians should be killed by Mrs. Clin@@ ton E@@ mails , but later he said , &quot; Of course I meant the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows to move Mr. Tr@@ ump to shift the language boundaries in politics and then return on demand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test such as certain messages from his fans , as they are arriving , and then , if necessary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication sex@@ ist who observed the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements , so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of sharp@@ ening the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has adopted a corro@@ sive sound , as its demand would go further .
a new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , published on Friday , a guided tour with a huge margin in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his prov@@ ok@@ ant pron@@ oun@@ c@@ ements , he acc@@ uses his critics to conce@@ de his statement or mis@@ understand his hum@@ our .
but while he has strengthened the focus of attention in the past months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps treats his loyal co @-@ scatter@@ ing into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how prov@@ ok@@ ant his statements may be .
Rudolph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps most prominent princ@@ esses , had great efforts to defend candidates today in a CNN @-@ interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was questioned about the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense true that Barack Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ t@@ ling , completely wrong and so it happened because he moved the troops out of Iraq .
most mainstre@@ am rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as an Foreign Minister , ISIS allowed ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East is aggressive under control .
in front of the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and threw them to return on any of his words and to be vo@@ iced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts who try to understand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps ap@@ ologies , as just a further proof that he was in@@ appropriate for the presidency .
once upon the price of the market , café in Green@@ point comes back
Ver@@ b Cafe was a sh@@ ot@@ tom@@ y café in William@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years of good coffee ser@@ ved .
of course , the prices from its Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ in front was pushed .
the business So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , employed in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
indigenous people acted as last loss in a opposite city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still cannot believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel exemp@@ t and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but when New York is a change , it is also new .
a re@@ vit@@ alized Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodriguez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old cafés , the owner and managing director of the new cafes .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide funds for a new outside power , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodriguez , 36 , kept a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lights out of the old ver@@ b .
but Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment .
he led new ingredients .
on the menu , sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ ages like cap@@ ers and sour onions .
there are natural en@@ code .
the café serves no beer more , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodriguez Rodriguez , that he had noticed a st@@ int current of old tri@@ bal customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also being pushed by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; William@@ sburg &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently in a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a client .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg , and visited the ver@@ b .
even after the Green@@ point she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way forward .
after the ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coffee ink , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that it was on the coffee and the culture in the ver@@ b which I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if they had a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea , a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the start of the ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before the work and ordered in@@ sof@@ ar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss watch , and they prepare my Everything @-@ Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photograph Rodriguez , he wanted to experiment and receive new ingredients into the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal gets his usual order now , but sometimes he changes his Everything @-@ ba@@ gel with bacon , eggs and cheese .
Rodriguez said that he won &apos;t have won a Gro@@ ll that the soap business was taken to the old business room .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie really b@@ ans to produce a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of coffee shops as an ingredient .
&quot; I think we will go to their offer , &quot; Rodriguez Rodriguez .
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points accepted the café also .
a new customer has translated the menu in Polish , and Rodriguez said that he planned to ask them soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome .
the location also has further advantages .
a local juice locally wants to fill the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee in bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café is expanding at a neighboring building .
for many customers a new ver@@ b is enough to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed in the ground when the café closed .
when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ en@@ itt told that the location of the Lok@@ als and the Order felt a new coffee like hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .

their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the story of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a reporter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ au@@ ky snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the IP@@ crash in 1929 .
bricks , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese filling with olive trees , while co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable intake .
when the reporter took place in Hack@@ neys , he found the pair for a discussion on the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; abundant foods were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there was pean@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient .
imagine so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner .
CO@@ E gr@@ un@@ ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been on the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
men of women co@@ ves for male rocks and it was served fresh baked past@@ ures for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food during the first World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; distingu@@ ishes the roads with which the country went over to be no longer the Schl@@ ar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time for the Americans to be a central , connected theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instructed Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget makes the new budget : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and cavi@@ ties were considered to be stap@@ le food , the casserole as &quot; wonderful way , dining remains re@@ inst@@ able , &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man noticed , since ch@@ efs could hide in@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ atively sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit .
meat , which was the centre of the American kitchen for years , became a rare luxury .
pec@@ uli@@ ar mix@@ tures have been tried , as a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nour@@ ish satisfaction had priority to taste or even healthy cuisine .
during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , bricks a dish made of this ep@@ och , baked onions with pean@@ ut butter .
&quot; it was not a popular addition to the mid@@ day , &quot; Co@@ e says .
brick leads further up : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pean@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the house@@ keeping .
as never before or ever since , household appliances - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the country &apos;s eating habits .
by sending recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ keeper &quot; and the challenge of converting P@@ amp@@ e like creamy sp@@ aghetti with carrots into delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historical treat .
in particular , the reports about the government &apos;s response to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ Cake @-@ Essen post@@ ure .
while he was publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmers in the kitchen of his kitchen , he sp@@ ear@@ ed as the million@@ aire man &apos;s million@@ aire man , to whom he has become .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he liked continental cuisine such as fish with a belt sauce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ate in a almost g@@ ilded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ king .
he was really real@@ time foreign .
President Roosevelt could perhaps have committed the same mistakes , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to pay an example of his stomach .
as described in the book , the farmer offered no interest in flavors by Ms. Roosevelt said that the White House brought the most boring food in Washington but also one of the most prepared meals . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , turn down with food , was dis@@ car@@ ded once the country came back onto the legs .
the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , Zi@@ egel@@ man said , as well as science was applied to food .
the pair has been better understood at the writing of the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ mans wife &apos;s mother in law - for example , as they could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; Co@@ e said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; brick re@@ minded : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she really made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was a wind@@ fall in the wind@@ fall .
after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they removed and Co@@ e a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert , the president Roosevelt took lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une Whi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a common trick , modest recipes to miss a chic name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no proposed cream , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone di@@ ved a bit disgu@@ sted a spoon in the t@@ amed , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad .
CO@@ E took three times a supplement .

killed during bombs : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khaled Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save his life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a Fass@@ bomb attack by the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group that had saved life almost 60,000 people in the picture newspaper .
29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers put their own life on the game to attract people from destroyed homes and to make first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
Omar was the vision of the group : a video of the civil servant that shows him at an 11 hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians to the shining symbol in the horror of war .
as a hero , however , he never saw himself , said the picture : &quot; for me it is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Omar himself fell victim to attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have thrown four versions of faç@@ ade over the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now remove the toxic re@@ mn@@ ants of the bomb , so that no children can play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited the picture his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime should hit terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest cycl@@ one is nearly 400 years old
more rare sight .
Greenland we usually come to the surface only in the winter .
this ha@@ i was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a fine 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - to this day .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie was only getting up with 150 years .
leis@@ urely walks along the North Atlantic along the bottom of the North Atlantic , an average of 1,@@ 220 metres in an hour .
only when it comes to it , the five metre long animal acceler@@ ates at a wh@@ opping 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a Rob@@ be .
this kind of lon@@ el@@ iness is characterized by long life , but seems to be a patent for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the professional journal &quot; Science &quot; at any age of Greenland , who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock commented on this li@@ fes@@ pan , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
although the Evol@@ u@@ tions@@ bi@@ ologist probably suspect that Greenland are st@@ on@@ stone .
only the evidence is missing .
Greenland &apos;s ha@@ unt are hard to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water @-@ temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually dive in the winter only in the winter .
researchers provide a little bit of the lifestyle of Greenland researchers .
her time @-@ pent@@ ine is known , when she gave six animals with a station in front of Spit@@ s@@ bergen .
nevertheless , this shar@@ ks make this shar@@ ks : in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another one had swallowed up the ja@@ w of a young polar bears .
possibly they hunt sleep@@ y animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice cream and are looking for cad@@ aver , which tor@@ ches from higher water layers down to bottom .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland ha@@ unt , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitz@@ bergen from the North Atlantic &apos;s depth .
the smallest Ha@@ i was just 81 cen@@ tim@@ eters long while the biggest 502 @-@ cen@@ timet@@ re measured .
to determine the age of animals , it analy@@ zes the lens of the shar@@ ks with the Carbon @-@ 14 method .
this center of the eye lens emerg@@ es already before the birth of shar@@ ks , which contained in the proteins later , will no longer be renewed .
the two smallest shar@@ ks were stri@@ k@@ ingly high Carbon @-@ 14 in the lens @-@ core .
after the early 1960s , after the early 1960s , larger quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere was worse .
in the 220 @-@ cen@@ tim@@ eters long , the lens of the lens contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012 .
in their lens @-@ core , all larger Greenland we had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts due to cosmic rays of the atmosphere .
in fact , the Carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timet@@ re was an age of 335 years , while the record Ha@@ i with 502 cen@@ tim@@ eters should be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Grön@@ land@@ hai @-@ females first got offspring when they are more than four meters , was known .
now , the researchers were able to arrange a age .
as one of the animals with 3@@ 92 cen@@ tim@@ eters probably stood on the threshold for sexual maturity and its age was 156 years old , Greenland with the reproduction of at least one and a half centuries .
also this is likely to be the world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ es live mainly in icy waters , is no coincidence .
the previous record holder , a 211 years old Grön@@ land@@ w@@ al , washed at the neck of the neck a 120 year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on top , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to low temperatures , the organism is often living on the flame of spar@@ ks .
so they mature later - and al@@ beit slow .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often particularly big .
because the volume is growing much faster than its surface , due to the animal heat .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than a gram elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on making many offspring as soon as possible as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolution@@ ary Bi@@ ologist Sch@@ rous lein as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal should invest in contrast to its resources more in a long life .
ab@@ yss in double pack
with topics around construction , the Municipal Council has focused on the most recent session at the most recent session .
with relief , the panel received the communication of mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently proven housing can begin . &quot;
after the principle of land , par@@ don@@ ating and closing issues were clari@@ fied , the sale of plots in the residential areas &quot; road @-@ road &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( range of Bin@@ der@@ straße - section section 1 ) is nothing in the way for interested parties .
the Municipal Council is convinced that the bending in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au young families and hat@@ ched sen@@ iors alike .
as it was said , Assembly cons@@ ents to report immediately in the town hall , on the awar@@ ding of the plots is expected to advise in its September session .
in order to expand further industrial companies , connected to the creation of job creation , the Municipal Council decided to recre@@ ate the newly created area plan in partial areas only in the spring of this year .

Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
the main competition was the best chance to attract jobs and companies in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from Bre@@ xit &apos;s vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the key financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W .
after a Bre@@ xit &apos;s referendum , it is uncertain whether funds will continue to operate from London &apos;s financial transactions throughout the EU .
for the so @-@ called EU @-@ Pass the approval in Britain has so far been enough .
this is just great US banks .
several banks have already announced to re@@ locate jobs .
the praise association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; calcul@@ ates 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years .
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , is the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which united responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks of the euro zone , as well as further important authorities such as European insurance coverage of E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk of ES@@ R@@ B .
although in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) have its headquarters , but this is less important to finance the financial industry than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the bank@@ note is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg holds a large fund business , cutting edge , as well as Dublin as well as in the infrastructure .
in Frankfurt , Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the great airport .
further , the city with slightly available commercial property .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are also 50 percent higher than in the Main region at the Seine .
in addition , Frankfurt has higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city will stand in place seven , Luxemburg on No.@@ 19 , Dublin at No. 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its strong position as a financial site for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite a Bre@@ xit &apos;s vote .
for this reason , power relations : in London according to numbers of Landesbank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 , some 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking sector , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead wins legal costs from hepatitis C Patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. counterpart decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to the re@@ im@@ bur@@ s@@ ement of the legal costs that emerged from the h@@ ep@@ ati@@ te C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was liberated from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents from Mer@@ ck , who , in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster @-@ drug S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ v@@ oni of Gilead , after a US judge out@@ lined a pattern of mis@@ conduct by Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other inhumane acts .
on the request of the complaint on Thursday , U.S. counterpart , Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead are entitled to the expense of the cost , which were created during the defense of the F@@ alles .
Mer@@ ck tries to rec@@ ti@@ ze the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications which can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck contrac@@ ted each other and took possession of laboratory work in which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vi@@ r attributed to the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead .

in 2015 Clin@@ t earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % of federal taxes
in 2015 , Hillary Clinton released their tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the demo@@ lition of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 the Clinton donated US $ 1 million for ben@@ evol@@ ent purposes , mainly to Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ aries ; the former Foreign Minister issued a income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for their book on the Department of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine , Virginia , published his tax declar@@ ations of the last ten years along with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hillary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to focus standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; presented by Clin@@ ton Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ per Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i .
in a sharp contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hi@@ des behind false statements and re@@ trac@@ ts in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax declar@@ ations .
it is usual to publish their tax declar@@ ations for US presidential candidates , although they are not oblig@@ ated by Law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated as a reason for ref@@ using a tax examination by tax authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clin@@ t election campaign in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the publication of the Presi@@ dential candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael Cohen , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Advisor said to CNN that he wouldn &apos;t allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the controls are not completed .
Tr@@ um@@ ps revi@@ ewers , among other things , the republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already known that its ref@@ usal issues related to assets , donations for ben@@ evol@@ ent organizations , its business operators and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton had already cast a video on the internet on Friday and on Friday he released a video on the Internet in the first ranking of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans Tr@@ ump to publish his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke the subject even during a speech on the economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what any other Presi@@ dential candidate has done in the past decades and publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
POL@@ IT@@ ICO reported that Tr@@ ump has not paid only very little taxes for two years , and an economic journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax ha@@ des and tax advis@@ ors that could still be the case .
Bundes@@ taxes have become a subject in election campaign .
Clinton supports a rule which is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that people would pay more than USD 1 million to pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a election campaign for Hillary Clinton in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka , buff@@ ets , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has allowed his seat to exchange a meeting in order to exchange their tax declar@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he had under@@ gone a tax examination of the IRS and I have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ ton &apos;s campaign has announced tax return back to 2007 .
the Clin@@ ton , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective tax rate of approx . 40@@ ,5 % .
the government &apos;s tax return of 2015 showed that these only USD 100 of their income relative to wages , different than the majority of all Americans .

con@@ doms with chi@@ li@@ pu@@ des , fire@@ work body promote Tanz@@ anian elephant protection
Natur@@ alists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox kind to prevent eleph@@ ants from living in people - they throw con@@ doms to them that are filled with chi@@ li@@ pu@@ des .
the method has proven to be effective and the Honey@@ moon Foundation , which had already been the idea of years ago , has trained to promote a violent four @-@ step method for protection of their houses and harvest without inf@@ rin@@ gement animals without hur@@ ting animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears have been used to defend themselves .
Friday is the phone day that is dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit we have developed a change in this con@@ greg@@ ations that they can keep the elephant from their fields , without damage the eleph@@ ants , &quot; says the managing director of Honey@@ guide Damian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bubbles in a horn .
if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; is thrown .
chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth will be packed together with a fire body in a con@@ dom , whose end up to the ignition box is shot .
when it is lighted , the con@@ dom with a b@@ ang on and spray fine dust in chi@@ li@@ pu@@ ff into the air .

one last possibility is a throwing , which is shooting in the air and caused a loud , bright explosion .

Jewish director proposes the Berlin hotel because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; collection - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots settled a media watch , after he revealed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel listed no Israeli pre@@ fix in Berlin , as it had requested Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust Doc@@ umentation &quot; Sho@@ a , &quot; wrote his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann attempted to find Israel on the selection list of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed between countries that can be accessed directly from the hotel room .
how did it come in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new German state that Israel is eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel about their own call center .
looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer that he got there , &quot; pointed him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
the hotel said that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel &apos;s management . &quot;
the reason that stood behind , dissolved in the director , even more fur@@ y .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the election will be deleted , &quot; the employees of Lanz@@ mann was cited .
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this is carried out in Germany in this hotel chain is even greater dis@@ grace .
no explanation requires this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draws the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a pretty big reson@@ ance on the Internet , where people called the whole sc@@ andal .
some under@@ min@@ ed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had given the alleged view of the Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another post where it was pointed out that the hotel that is located on the no@@ bles Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , close to a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel quickly rejected all the exc@@ uses of himself and called the incident . &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , Der Spiegel reports .
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; Israel did not record in the high definition list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cont@@ ested a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
it adds that the country code is now added .
police places Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Rub@@ ber charges against prot@@ esters Brazilian students
students were launched on Thursday in the Brazilian town of Sao Paulo with the police as they gathered to demonstrate against the reforms of government for the public education system .
the police employed a tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to gr@@ ate the students , which led to the police rubber bul@@ lets and tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as police .
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation over the plans .
according to the proposals of the federal state Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300.000 students are implemented to save money .
some of the protest@@ ants saw Gra@@ ff@@ i@@ tits against the provisional president Michel T@@ emer on walls .
the recent protests took place several days after prot@@ esters in the streets to support the sus@@ pen@@ sive president Dil@@ ma R@@ ousse@@ ff , which was reli@@ eved by a vote of the Senate for their expul@@ sion from the Office .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rise to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ in D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade exchange between Moscow and Teheran , rose to 7@@ 0.9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies grew heavily on businesses in the country , divided by the ambassador .
Russian companies existing connections with Iran , while new companies are willing to provide access to the market .
of course , another trading building is one of the largest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan said .
he realized that the trade exchange between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , the Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent , and tot@@ alled $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the commercial down@@ turn was reached by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes out for this year by a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year Russia accounted for about 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily on Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries that concerns tourist number in Russia .
one could say that the record number of Irish tourists will be broken down in Russia from the last year , &quot; he said .
at the same time , only few Russians visit Iran , something , from which the am@@ bass@@ adors hopes it will change .
&quot; personally , I can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d to have received the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said .

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms into home when Br@@ ite wins gold for cycling
Schot@@ t@@ lands Call@@ um Sk@@ inner &apos;s last evening in the mouth team spr@@ int in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the sc@@ roll of his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the young and made the legend proud when he stor@@ med to home a victory of the Favor@@ ites New Zealand .
England claimed four years ago , while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympic medals .
they repeated the trick once in March at the subway World Championships in London despite the return of Ho@@ ys , only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as exec@@ utions .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap that tried to close Ki@@ an Em@@ adi and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton .
Sk@@ inner was the man , with whom they stayed , when they saw the potential in the gravel , which now un@@ folds .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the last four years ago with Ho@@ y victorious - and Sk@@ inner put into the Quali@@ fication round a Olympic Stadium , but in the stand@@ ings winning the New Ze@@ al@@ ander in the first lap .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his turn left behind , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner held it .
a strategy change made a large part of transformation , in which the passing of a higher speed drove it to slow down and it Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked back from his position as a BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they went to the podium .
the 23 @-@ year old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am just here to do my best and make a name .
we have set a Olympic record in the En@@ dr@@ unde and defe@@ ats the World Champion .
it was just amazing .
there is no better way to win .
after the triumph in 2012 on the page Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ ds were admitted that he fell after a weak start to the train .
he returned this statement later and there was no appeal by Engl@@ ands Riv@@ alen .
this time there was no problem with such a superior victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like London &apos;s flags on the tri@@ bun@@ e like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have joined the team in the last three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we are expecting successful five days at Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the shape of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of possible that he repe@@ ats the victory of three Olympic medals in a competition .
that would be exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on March 23 ( a apparently holy date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster ) were born , a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the coming from Ho@@ y is equal .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int part , which begins today and will start over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this just for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels somewhat embarrass@@ ing , alone to win .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he won two gold medals , he should become a k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were some good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll quali@@ fier with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four kilometer race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the finish line .
the world record that won gold in 2012 was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition at the Wig@@ gins with safety in focus .
he had fought yesterday with the qualification before the qualification , when the function@@ aries were called to measure his body @-@ size .
in the appropriate women competition , resum@@ ed tomorrow , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald von Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in the world record in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team reli@@ es on his strong train team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and take a stake to medals .
according to a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio have been shut down .
they played dra@@ mas in the background , so the resignation of the technical Leit@@ ers Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April were in the midst of sex and mo@@ b@@ ing@@ les , as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if you see the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like that the legendary call G@@ BS , who has reached the perfect moment of its cli@@ max , can be repeated again .
future of the melting of Portland , due to lifting the energy consumption .
the future of aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand on the game , as the plant operator will termin@@ ate the energy supply contracts , and thereby raise all the delivery contracts , as provided by the provided energy company .
this step was followed by the government &apos;s decision at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a maxim@@ inum payout is scheduled for 20 years .
up to 2,000 jobs in the facility of Al@@ coa in Portland are on the game .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
in addition , it could come to Domin@@ o@@ effects , since the melting plant consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa completed the Point Henry melt , which led to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea force last year .
the melting of Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and ris@@ ked a closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australia dollar and last due to the power price for the installation .
AG@@ L , which delivers big aluminium tu@@ bs with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Latin America , shared with that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the facility is located in the majority of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p will keep smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to run in Portland , which means another physical demand for electricity by the melting point , &quot; divided the company .
AG@@ L continued to say that the &quot; securing transactions &quot; were to be entered into force from November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month termination period , so they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from hence , AG@@ L assumes that contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the power supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong term markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L shared with that it has already written the value of contracts in the amount of $ 187 million in anticip@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AL@@ CO@@ A said that the decision to book treaties showing the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; skill of liqu@@ or ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to guarantee the power supply to the melt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. company said that there have been a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have been able to enter into force from November this year , even if it is still a statement .
analysts war@@ n due to the bad economic conditions of the industry in front of the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle .
in reference to the analysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland consume about 600 meg@@ awatts and Tom@@ ago approximately 900 meg@@ awatts .
if both plants disappear from the market , it would mean considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and it would not be good for us as a power generator , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , B@@ ander@@ a is on the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ edition of the Vo@@ gue
Antonio Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth subsidiary of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
B@@ ander@@ a , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , given me the sight of this cover to weeping , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote B@@ ander@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unveil@@ ing of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ es like that ? ) , forget the whole Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of problem cases between Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) as they have completed the cover of her sister and ending with a classical turn . you have all planned a surprise party .
this puts the clear action of almost every birthday of a children &apos;s turn ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the proposition , &quot; you thought that we would have forgotten you ? &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon by 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to take part in this public@@ ity .
with regard to the Sept@@ ember@@ edition of the Vo@@ gue , safety was launched with safety for a new era of the Kar@@ da .
Kend@@ alls big sister Kim likes her to be beaten with the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband Kan@@ ye West , on April 2014 ) , but the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ edition of the magazine is a league for itself .
the Sept@@ ember@@ edition is the most selling issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference , which resem@@ bles more than a fashion journal , the output pul@@ ls a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista , of the 8@@ 32 pages of the ball ( 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the unveil@@ ing of his Co@@ ver@@ stars is anticipated that in the past two years pictures of the magazine is still le@@ ak@@ ened before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover were Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , the fashion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models , the celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ Lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or @-@ Brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the low chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; passing @-@ brother &quot; of her generation - under the earlier category , it is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous persons , or reality stars or you@@ ths of today , who know how to turn a good snap@@ chat video ( even if it applies to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who distinguish themselves in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of their career .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success to everyone .
with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers was always curious in the fashion world .
in June , the Secret Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Stephanie Sey@@ m@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleagues in Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critic@@ ised her &quot; Mist@@ akes of the moment . &quot;
these feelings come up again , when the message came out with the appearing J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but riding on the Mis@@ sm@@ ut seems to pass by the point .
B@@ ander@@ a is on the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the true sense of the word , a super@@ model .
it works for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer basis of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
she and all her sisters are selling pictures of their respective pay@@ wall @-@ apps .
she sold her done pictures from C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds to the magazine .
and in their free time they can see them in reality TV . presumably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
a total of 16@@ 0.000 people every year
more than 16@@ 0.000 the aid of the country are rejected annually by the Municipal Council Cent@@ res , while the branch is taken on the impact of further mid @-@ term transactions for already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Queensland there are already three of five persons - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ real Del@@ og@@ ations and those who have no means for free legal advice and legal counsel .
legal services of the municipality , which are already excessive , are ready for further cuts .
as of June next year , this legal centres will lose further 30 percent of their federal funds .
the director of the community centres of Que@@ enst@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Community centers revealed that thousands of people are rejected every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse by the federal government &apos;s decision .
&quot; Queens@@ lands Common Market Centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people from important services that you need will be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and pres@@ sive debt , families who were dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been un@@ ju@@ stly released - all these people have trouble @-@ free manner and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need .
the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent in June 2017 , meaning that thousands of helpful people from Queensland will be forced to satisfy with their legal problems without any help .
we call for the Federal Prosecutor and the Federal Minister of Transport , as well as Sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to withdraw these middle cuts promp@@ tly , so the people need the help they need to receive legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for juris@@ dictions on the national average .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now at the time to view the needs of the community centres and its customers to view , and that the Government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k is investing in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Berlin / Schwerin : survey of countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , significant losses for government parties SPD and CD@@ U are characterised .
this resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute in ins@@ a for the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition could fall short in the north , this is not possible after the demand in Berlin .
in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party , and thus would have good chances to continue heads of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD collapsed from 3@@ 5.6 percent to 24 percent five years ago .
according to the survey , the party would only be just slightly ahead of the CD@@ U who could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is fought between the left and AF@@ D .
the left would be 19 percent ( previously 18,@@ 4 percent ) , the AF@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s day .
the Gre@@ ens are rising in spite of slight losses with 6 percent ( previously 8.7 percent ) once again in the heavy seas .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented by 3 percent in the country &apos;s country .
according to the German Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the SPD was based only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 2@@ 8.3 per cent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 2@@ 3,4 percent .
this means that the green with 19 per cent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but above the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the AF@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the Congress of Represent@@ atives .
at 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would not miss it as opposed to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in Tim@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago , the Nokia communic@@ ator came into the market .
today , the success@@ ors domin@@ ate the world - its manufacturers experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and bigger , it was therefore not good in hand .
on the contrary , it was quite cl@@ unk@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ abytes at first , which would suff@@ ice today for about two sel@@ fies high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ abytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros , lovers will still buy the equipment on the Internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet .
20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone producer had announced the product a few months earlier than the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hanover as &quot; office in the West @-@ format format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent for then a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator .
even access@@ ing web pages was possible by HTML browser , when too slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen was found .
quite proud was the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro .
the average price of smartphones in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could have seen in August 1996 that communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything has been different .
the smart phones are a success story , if not for Nokia .
the mobile phone arte on the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft and wrapped .
today , the market domin@@ ate the market , which all came much later than Nokia .
ever and everywhere , this is today for very many people everyday life .
in 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion devices were sold , Samsung and Apple are alone some 5@@ 55 million units .
the worldwide turnover of the equipment is approximately 400 billion euros .
the well @-@ running business of the countless app vend@@ ors and t@@ elec@@ oms concerts come .
around the smartphone in the meantime , a whole industry has emerged .
the decisive breakthrough to mass market came first at the beginning of 2007 , at that time , Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he has three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communication , everything by touch screen easy to use .
the Apple &apos;s victory of Apple began , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the thought .
they disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the S@@ agen now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after its invention .
on average , every German now has 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to learn all the smartphone even to get away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Kugel , responsible for the Siemens executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand Heath@@ row
Heath@@ row is not only in our local community and throughout London , but throughout the country renewal and prosperity .
for me this was the biggest attraction in Heath@@ row , just like that in 2012 in London , when we run a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions prof@@ ited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will come back by creating new possibilities for local residents and companies near Heath@@ row .
for our local communities we will already present 10,000 new teachers , 40,000 new jobs and prepare for youth unemployment in the airport &apos;s air environment .
as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of the extension of Heath@@ row is too large .
I told me that England will never be ready for the games and we will bl@@ am@@ ate ourselves on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong with Heath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to winds , but Heath@@ row respon@@ ds to every question .
like the Olympic Games Heath@@ row is for many and not for individual infrastructure project .

we have a great team in Heath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure program in time and budget , from T5 - which was elected five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , built up to T2 , which was built in the midst of the two performance cat@@ walk of the world .

ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; regarding ad locking blocks
for companies that earn money with online cash , according to one of the software producer attempts to handle sco@@ oping block , a &quot; Cat@@ z@@ - and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad picking on its desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it means that users could update their filters in the program to rec@@ ise advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared with that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ es would change the coding based on his advertis@@ ements to detect the advertis@@ ings that part of the page advertising is difficult to recognise .
but Ad@@ block told that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , the nar@@ r@@ ator of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her @-@ fighting has been in progress since the invention of advertis@@ ers in progress , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company for social media has settled in the struggle is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying sco@@ re@@ ier for the sector has become .
according to a study published by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe 200 million people worldwide , according to a study by the last year . almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily application users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , hand@@ y@@ wor@@ ries makes 84 percent of promotional releases .
the company has an ad block block on desktop PCs , as mobile ad block block@@ ers have no effect on fac@@ ebook mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a speaker .
advertising on your desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenues so Facebook appears the investment of such a stri@@ de as a worthwhile .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared with that it would be to upgrade his &quot; ad cluster tool &quot; to have more control over them advertis@@ ed on them .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block should be wor@@ rying as new filters , because they would also block content on the side , which are no advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the user there is no positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared a spokes@@ man from Facebook in an e @-@ mail message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt agent , which is why we have focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , to put more control into the hands of the people .
woman with suspected suicide on Swiss Autobahn
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witnesses to pass after a woman in the early morning hours of Thursday at a presum@@ able suicide of several vehicles on a motorway .
the incident happened at the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman put himself in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the streets and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 , that of several vehicles , including a truck car , was going to kill himself .
they died still on site .
several drivers have been heard already , but some are still not identified , the police , those as well as every voucher of the incident , were reported to report .
it was opened an investigation proceedings , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , divided Gilles Hof@@ st@@ etter to the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to wait if one of the drivers are displayed .
was a violation of a violation ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the prosecutor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not drawn towards the responsibility .
in each of the two cases - in which one person ran in the dark on the highway - was decided that drivers do not need to go out that a pedestrian in the middle of the night run on the motorway as it was in the newspaper .
last year a polic@@ eman acquitted when she had over and killed a man , who was in August 2014 one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne .
22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk , and has become un@@ conscious in the street .
the court noted that polic@@ eman - who had responded to an emergency call -- a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely extraordinary and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the Judge .
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges should report at the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Climate Change : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
the Venus was probably inhab@@ itable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms , which res@@ emble from climate research .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have recorded similar conditions with their hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow shift of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , al@@ lied atmosphere , and turned on slowly .
the model also lit the top@@ ography of early Venus .
the planet probably pointed out more dry places than Earth , but had once enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and shake off faster ev@@ ap@@ oration .
early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun which was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow change of Venus is exposed to its daily side of the Sun nearly two months , &quot; G@@ ISS scientist Anthony D@@ el Gen@@ io stated in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which seems like an umbrella seems to block the surface of a large part of the sun heat .
the result are average temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model brought a history of Venus , which resem@@ bles the evolution that has been suspected of Planet@@ en@@ explored .
although it was presumably inhab@@ itable , the Venus -- exposed to much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billion years .
their oceans are ev@@ apor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned down by ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with@@ drew from a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which as we know them today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy coming back as a Trainer of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy coming back on Thursday as a Trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and resulted in a low determination of co @-@ determination of the team &apos;s decision making .
alternatively , President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and realized that the club will immediately search for a new coach .
&quot; in the last three years I have my duties as chief trainer and vice president Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and consistency , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy has said in a position .
I thought during the summer long and much more about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , it needs and to bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the Vision of the Trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey operations must be matched to the organization .
he also must have a co @-@ determination in decisions which influence the team &apos;s performance .
these conditions are not fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
we all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy was honored during his debut season with the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the league .
he led the club to 112 points and at first place in Central Vision , but Colorado , he was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed during each of the last years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the wild for a second Wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference around five points .
as Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart , Roy gained four Stanley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Canadi@@ en and Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ werk take talks back talks , set off strike
the workforce concerning the re@@ mun@@ eration for the Baltic Sea workers are exposed , while all parties take place for a new meeting round at the table , the negoti@@ ator said .
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group , spor@@ adi@@ cally conducted on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group , as well as the Un@@ ites and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unions can confirm that we have united ourselves to re @-@ launch the current course process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will stop a few day sessions in the coming weeks , starting at the beginning of the next year to re @-@ start the problems .
the trade unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has reduced its rates to its contra@@ sts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s advice follows a 10 percent decline in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said additional cuts to the company needed the necessary space to get through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has announced for its part of thousands of people and announced plans to aband@@ on oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it ration@@ alized its business activities as a result of its meg@@ az@@ ure attack with the British energy company BG Group .
as a result of the lower raw prices , energy companies are under pressure , an economic situation which , through the decision of the British in June , had strengthened the European Union .
the Scottish Parliament committee Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders in early this week to discuss one of the largest labour disp@@ utes ever since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion share of spending for new projects in the North Sea are expected in comparison to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Kepler measures the star rate of stars in the star Wars of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Kepler &apos;s space teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the complete catalogue of rotation rates below the stars of the star@@ base of the Ple@@ y@@ ades .
the new data will help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars are rotating at different rates , as well as in which context of the planetary cycles are standing .
&quot; we hope to learn more about the compar@@ isons of our outcomes with other star@@ base , more about the relationship between the mass of an star , its age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light@@ years removed from the earth .
many stars in this constellation , which emerged about 125 million years ago , reach adul@@ thood .
they now rotate the fastest .
these mat@@ uring stars meet these mat@@ uring stars large quantities of star@@ ches .
because these winds are travelling through the stars &apos; magnetic fields , they have a brake effect on the stars .
if an aster@@ isk is filtered , its rotation starts slow@@ ed down .
Kepler measures the rotation of any star by exam@@ ining the time between the appearance of an recogni@@ zable star@@ base -- like sun@@ spots -- recognize .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates points out that more massive stars slow@@ ed slower than a massive star @-@ star .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with a larger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes and smaller than smaller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Ple@@ y@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the cluster of the Ple@@ y@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic lab to compare the qualities as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the star cluster of the Ple@@ y@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
there is much more than we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars their red shoes are slow down and so to speak to their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues are reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star starting
our tears ran faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base .
after its emotional return of return , the 41 @-@ year old pro will take action against T@@ ampa Bay R@@ ays for last time the Tri@@ ko@@ t of New York Yan@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; to the &apos; said the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star Game Particip@@ ants of Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodriguez Rodriguez was voted the most valuable player of the league , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es the World Series .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract awarded him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
by the end of the contrast on 31 December 2017 , he acts as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary .
as a player paid it a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 @-@ 2004 ) and since 2005 he made the Yan@@ ke@@ es a few mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays are only two further bas@@ eball player in the major statistics similar values .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is likely to be not included in the bas@@ eline circuit of the bas@@ eb@@ alls .
for so successful Rodriguez - nickname &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - in the field it was cont@@ ested , its occurr@@ ence outside the square .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 the Super@@ star at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave him forbidden Ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was imprisoned for 211 games due to an execution of the so called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal at the end of 2014 .
Rodriguez is considered to be the prime suspect for years to have preserved over an anti @-@ aging hospital in South Florida .
after a dispute the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could even have done a skir@@ mish for the year 2014 , because I played 20 years without break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodriguez Rodriguez then swe@@ eping . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his farewell @-@ days are not no@@ is@@ eless too .
while many bas@@ eball legends have received the big stage once again , Rodriguez had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win every game , &quot; Yan@@ ke@@ es Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rodriguez , who was married to actress Cameron Di@@ az and the relationships with Pop@@ star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson , sympathy , sympathy and fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee @-@ Arch@@ rival Boston Red SO@@ X .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sang the tra@@ ilers at 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodriguez team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first d@@ oping cases
caught : due to a positive d@@ oping test , Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland must not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed by the first official d@@ oping cases .
a caught athl@@ ete had won almost a medal .
before the seventh contest date , the first official d@@ oping cases have become the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 metres steep@@ le ch@@ ase in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski have been positively tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the athle@@ tic athle@@ tics cont@@ ests .
at Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de had been detected last Sunday , which is used as a m@@ asked tool for d@@ oping substances .
the International Sport Court CA@@ S confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butter@@ fly , only around 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday Ch@@ en would have to take part in the courts over 50 m Freestyle .
Ch@@ en received the opening of the B @-@ test and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
the national association take the matter &quot; very serious and demands of Ch@@ en full cooperation among the investigations , &quot; zi@@ pped X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will work together with the International Sports Tribunal CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot;
for the first time in history there is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the sanc@@ tion of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio , the news about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa through , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only declaration could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is said to act in the banned substance to act the blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ ers EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa is sus@@ pending , according to the B@@ NT , the B @-@ test should have been positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ sow came back immediately with criticism of the athl@@ ete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men do not pull the right battles &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in such a way , about all weight lif@@ ter from the chron@@ ically d@@ op@@ ener nation must not take part in Rio .
in Friday the case of &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in class up to 85 kg was tested positive and tested positive on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
both are likely to start taking , however , they may not run in class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athl@@ ete , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another heavy blow for the reputation of the overall sport .
the IA@@ AF world association had led the entire Russian team up to an exception for systematic d@@ oping for the start , the L@@ äu@@ er@@ nation Kenya also produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in addition to the swimming pool , the previous verses in China had also su@@ ck@@ led for fierce fights even between the athletes .
so the Fren@@ chman Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I see the podium over 200 m Freestyle , I want to pass on myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sun stood at the heart of a meditation on Australian M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for D@@ oping Bet@@ rü@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 , Sun had a positive effect on the Chinese Championships on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din but only had to sit down a three @-@ month lock .
dat@@ kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de presses H@@ acker their rans@@ om
programm@@ ers of black@@ mail @-@ malware rely on targeted companies - and are successful .
according to a current survey conducted by the malware Test Speci@@ alists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surveyed companies surveyed have been at least once , partly several victims of a attack with black@@ mailing software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies have already reached the target of a ran@@ som@@ ing black@@ mail .
40 per cent of the victims were willing to pay the solution requested by the off@@ ences to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the off@@ ender speci@@ alise their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially @-@ pressing solution is considerably higher than with private uses .
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of damage software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rators found the perpet@@ r@@ ator software for themselves .
only private use were the target , but the change to company attacks took place in the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once a victim &apos;s computer , it is searching for un@@ long @-@ changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as to archives of images and videos .
these files are encrypted and del@@ etes the origin@@ als .
subsequently the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
in order to get the final turn@@ key code to the files , the victims need money - mostly in the form of Bit@@ coin @-@ Bit@@ coin .
but where with private use the personal photo database is on the game , companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut .
correspon@@ d@@ ingly , the damage is due when a ran@@ som@@ y@@ ware fails .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses by Ran@@ som@@ ites , 13 percent had to completely inter@@ rupt their business activities in a case of risk .
in Germany , several hospitals of attacks had already been threatened by the loss of nurse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do not pay , you have only the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of the companies who pay , get their data back .
managers are difficult to refuse in view of the perpet@@ rators , in view of a stand@@ still in operation .
the h@@ acker again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study the researchers of F @-@ Secure analyzed the user interfaces and contact with the black@@ mailing lists and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators actually try to build a kind of customer service to increase more money .
they explain their victims per chat , as they can pay per Bit@@ coin , send free support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t free example files .
and they will be saved by individuals from a few hundred euros , companies must pay partly hard @-@ negoti@@ ate and five @-@ digit sum@@ s to rep@@ ay their data .
in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the ranks of the ranks , the h@@ ack@@ ers will always be professional and share the work , explains security experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ing about within a week . &quot;
more likely , however , that it is three or four people .
the programm@@ ers sell their damage software then in the form of a software modular to the actual black@@ mail .
the previous malware kits were created by making malware himself , consultation and additional tools for a single , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; included in the scope of delivery is a custom@@ ization tool so that smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ mail then look for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
so you log in one of the forums in the underground , buy the set of a crime and instruc@@ ting a further order to install the software on as many PCs .
payment is made per ri@@ fied machine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , the criminals then bear sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ y@@ ware is now known for many companies that make their data better .
more than 50 per cent of the companies responsible for companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey are able to rely on the ran@@ som@@ ing through file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat for successful Er@@ p@@ ess@@ ung more , the perpet@@ rators are instead described with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price lists , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means the damage of damage depending on type of data is even higher than before .
also , the perpet@@ rators could take completely new goals on the Internet of things in the future .
on the h@@ ack@@ er@@ conference Def@@ con demonstrated safety researchers as they could get connected to the thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of winter , the isch@@ em@@ ing of a der@@ art blocked heating so many of the victims is quite a rans@@ om .
if the perpet@@ rators then block a whole factory road in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a subject in Industry 4.0 .

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and all @-@ day du@@ sting
in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and also the vers@@ atility of a mini@@ vans .
sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , has actually proved extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , passengers have lots of space in the first row and in the f@@ ond of space , it works at no place .

disease incident : when paid the organizer
holi@@ day@@ makers get back after their trip only then return if the cause of the disease is desper@@ ate to be found in the hotel .

in the case there was a family on the second day of their tur@@ mo@@ dest@@ ine cause severe diar@@ rhoea , and vomiting .

their illness brought back the holi@@ day@@ makers to a defective small scale , which allegedly polluted sea water .

better traffic flow on the motorway br@@ inger
it st@@ ole regularly on the surrounding road - here a picture of November .
but that is supposed to change : the legal counsel should be renewed .
this is a good news for all car drivers who stand in working traffic on the ambient way every night in the St@@ au when they drive over the motorway ( A 43 ) .
road transport leng@@ th@@ ens on upcoming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Road and Depart@@ ure Wes@@ eler Street , the right @-@ off track to be around 700 meters .
drivers can then use directly from the Hammer Road to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic is set up early , thus making the overall tri@@ b@@ tion process to be improved on the multi @-@ travel section of the Federal Road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit was the CD@@ U faction in the District of Münster @-@ West .
the drivers on the fe@@ eder is nervous , the drivers are nervous , especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
the back@@ stage goes back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ g path and sometimes beyond .
reason is the con@@ i@@ fer clock on the B 51 just before the departure Wes@@ eler Street .
from here , traffic is only one lane over the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built in front of a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations revealed that the bridge no longer have the required load capacity to absorb the sever@@ ity of heavy traffic .
as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and that , there will last continuous stress , the country can &apos;t say .
however , for years to calculate : because the bridge has an official resi@@ den@@ gue period up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal de@@ fle@@ ction , the state business consciously looked for transport in school holidays , because with disabilities .
traffic is run on Tuesday and Wednesday .

relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
in the evening you can walk etern@@ ally , at night you wake up , in the morning it is far ahead of the wake @-@ up ring not to think of sleep .
this is all other than relaxing .
after all , one has problems with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adult sleep problems and over ten percent found their sleep frequently or permanent than not relaxing .
how does sleep problems or sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
there are several forms of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces , and there are various causes of under@@ lying , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eks , board member of the German Society for Sch@@ la@@ ff@@ ing and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what you understand , however , is the In@@ som@@ nia , thus a single and down@@ sleeping disorder .
as a result , many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or in@@ sufficient , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , board member , says member of the German Domestic Research association with practice in the Sax@@ on Var@@ el .
what is behind sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
the causes of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces are complex .
organic , psychological or behavi@@ oral factors , but also medications are stuck behind .
not rarely is the sleep disorder expression of another disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is common especially for depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors need each other .
who , for example , has a band disc , can be po@@ or@@ ly lying , w@@ akes every two to three hours and begins to pon@@ der about everyday problems and drink , there is one example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I be with sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces to the doctor ?
those who do not sleep well over a month of at least three nights a week should not sleep well and the day is imp@@ aired , she should go to the doctor .
the imp@@ air@@ ment can look quite different : it is ro@@ uted , tired , und@@ ated , has difficulty with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints such as stomach or headache .
to ease the sleep disorder , it is important to find out their causes .
as a treatment options , behavi@@ oral changes , cog@@ nitive behavi@@ oral therapy , or even medicines - classical sleep tablets just for emergency and maximum for two weeks - in@@ qu@@ ire .
in Germany , there are hardly anyone living in Germany , emphas@@ ises Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ ber , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Research Centre at the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore you should contact with sleep problems initially at the hou@@ sen@@ er , advis@@ es We@@ eks .
this can clari@@ fy with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who was going to sleep in sleep , and what happens ?
for the study in the sleeping corner physician , for example , in snor@@ ing with respiratory irrit@@ ability , in sleep problems or if you do not find the cause of a sleep@@ y disorder , Fi@@ fa explains .
you do not have to prepare for the study .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not have lunch , &quot; says Fi@@ fa .
after the wi@@ de@@ away one gets to his normal time in bed .
in addition to the electro@@ des on the body , one is wearing a nose of nose , chest strap and a antenn@@ ae on his finger .
additionally , a camera shows the sleeping corner to the ceiling .
how can these problems get the handle in handle ?
there are quite a lot of screws , where you can sit for a better sleep .
Woe is counting on : regular sleeping and ris@@ ti@@ des , not to sleep long in bed , not watching television to sleep , alcohol mei@@ ght and at night not at the clock - then you start to count immediately , and that &apos;s quite and certainly not promoting .
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming
the former German @-@ s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has sold through Facebook to dis@@ appo@@ inting the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he had picked up gold for the first time in Doha and exhibited his first world record .
now , the former DS@@ V Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler turned over to his criticism from his criticism of the ex @-@ team mate via Facebook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where a Olympic champion receives € 20,000 € and a jungle cap@@ tive 150,000 € should not be surprised over missing medals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on Friday on his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conveyor system in the swimming pool is bad , the d@@ oping control is very good .
so we cannot compete with countries that are very much fo@@ stering , and not even operate on the topic D@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the inspec@@ tions should be set , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he started to launch a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler had to be reported for nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
just like that one should keep it with countries .
&quot; who can not be able to control a certain period prior to the World Cup / OS of independent controls of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; says the choice of Hamburg who runs a Eis@@ di@@ ele .
airport : gang of baggage ap@@ pre@@ h@@ ended
professional Di@@ ebe at the Airport Düsseldorf
on Thursday the arrest of two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 were killed on Thursday .
the crime nov@@ ices were committed to several T@@ ash@@ - and bag posts .
at 21.@@ 30 , civil servants recognised a gang from the airport of the airport in Düsseldorf , which had known the police officers from past theft .
the two women and two men have committed several dol@@ ences since the middle of July and were community @-@ friendly , working sti@@ ff@@ ly and particularly professional .
the Speci@@ alists of the Criminal Code 34 , which were intended to report specifically to commit offen@@ ders to Germany , have four actions .
they took over 15,000 euros in total .
Alt@@ builds , a few lin@@ tels , in between still the rest of the head of the head : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in looks at first sight , but the police counts them to the &quot; dangerous locations &quot; of the city .
if you travel along the road from east to west , you come to play places , a refresh@@ ed nursery and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
someone at the facade of a gray house someone has &quot; ugly ! &quot;
opposite a Li@@ dl which will soon be demol@@ ished , it is already built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new ten@@ ants will emerge .
article about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , however , are illustrated with burning cars in recent weeks .
reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have le@@ ase agreements , but on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and used for events .
since the beginning of the year , at the beginning of the year , the police had repeatedly called for a tough action against the project , the area as &quot; no @-@ Go @-@ zone &quot; for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous authority .
after on 22 June the rooms were cleared out on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ sch@@ mie@@ de , with 300 police officers , the police stopped three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officers and three club cars on site , locked parts of the street and kept visitors off to enter the house with number 94 .
meanwhile , renovated construction workers were commissioned by the unknown house owner .
on 13 July , a Berlin administration court ruled that the ev@@ ac@@ uation was illegal , and one day later , police and builders moved under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon , the road seems peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tained himself vor@@ ous late .
in the immediate vicinity of the building projects there are primary school and kinder@@ g@@ art@@ ens .
left violence is not the chief of many people : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer lives in the &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who has played three children here , are generated mainly by the police presence .
with the residents of the building projects , they share the care of increasing mi@@ ets and ri@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound after a Kie@@ z , who wanted to create multiple police protection from v@@ and@@ ing on the left .
the tren@@ ches which the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator and the police open between house relations and their neighbours , obviously doesn &apos;t exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in in the East Berlin was actually a traditional workforce , which is also a lower level of poverty in comparison to the rest of the city .
house @-@ owned and the new@@ bor@@ ns home projects are already a long walk to the &quot; Kie@@ z : &quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied by the former GDR , including nearly the whole Main@@ zer road close to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer was under large police officers in a real street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alised in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by people today , which they occupied 26 years ago .
at the same time , the borough of the world became increasingly becoming the mag@@ nets for tourists and elec@@ on@@ lin@@ ers from all over the world : with them the natives of GDR @-@ times and former house @-@ her@@ etics are sharing their Kie@@ z .
it is also noticeable in the r@@ ents that have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one can recognize them in designed slices or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which were cast with color bags .
no other street was mentioned this year as often with the words &quot; left autonomous violence . &quot;
a reason that not all neighbours can see that as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes as body injury , according to statistics , according to statistics , is almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the crimes make non@@ damage , the ten@@ den@@ ci@@ ally rather the newly built and newly renovated houses .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer lives for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in a le@@ house since 17 years , can not be heard by uncertainty .
as for violence , it is crucial : people in the 94 are their neighbours who have not been meant for this .
the famous burning cars also give it straight in the Rig@@ a@@ er to no longer .
for the study of architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , together live together on the street and gets more of each other than somewhere else . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consciously drawn into the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße - and remained .
this is why it was so important that the locals call their streets : from the police , politics and the media , which suddenly occupied all the Deut@@ sh@@ ear to the district in July .
but in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : by com@@ promising new buildings in former construction g@@ aps that push the old inhabitants .
&quot; indeed , the con@@ dom@@ inium , which are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well booked , &quot; she says .
&quot; violence and destruction I can absolutely no gu@@ ide@@ y . &quot;
but what should I do if a man does not listen to anyone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
for all@@ ot@@ ees who te@@ ats over color bombs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the building projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
who attracts , should be aware of it - just like anyone who moves into a pub district , which can complain badly about noise .
all people only provided with the names presented , did not be called to be called by their real name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new Refu@@ gee Commissioner
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in the integration and organis@@ er .
in addition , she is a social worker .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been refugee officers for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social ped@@ agog@@ y supports the team of administration to Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it sees itself as the contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else is missing .
Reg@@ ine customer of the working group indicates that the volunteer is more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the vast wool of wool , which has primarily a problem .
so some - less ridi@@ cul@@ ating than rather on the multitude of desire responsibilities - meant , meant that the management wanted to leave the place .
a administration with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long @-@ term experience in the field of social work , a jeal@@ ous wool of wool .
however , administrative work is not its central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le writes .
especially , it is an organization , working with people on the spot , and behind the scenes as well as network quality .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been with us for around six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent spot on three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the highest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le hon@@ ors and main actors supported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are large and small issues , organizational , human and understanding problems .
soon new containers are coming in the W@@ as@@ en@@ straße
a serious problem has been to be found since some time , apartments for connecting flights which have been recognized .
the local authorities are responsible for connecting the connection .
they must under@@ take the refugees in their own or hired living rooms .
the cost of building , rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the coun@@ cill@@ or to the municipality and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every land@@ lord wants to offer its apartment .
the search has been designed as very difficult for some time .
de facto , the administration does not find private homes .
it does not work so far , so you need to depend on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common apartments must be remembered as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers are installed in the W@@ as@@ en@@ straße .
but only apartments are not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a fixed lead , there are intern@@ ships , training courses , school places , one @-@ euro jobs and useful activities for refugees and migrants who have to be folded or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reported Reg@@ ine client .
many work in the building yard or help hou@@ sings , do not do @-@ for @-@ profit work - and that motivated and very ti@@ dy , such as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes the work for the community is to result in a positive effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he does not only mean work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the day needs a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and Customer .
people would have to develop a humili@@ ating feeling .
so we need offers as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so here the administration and Vol@@ untary Vol@@ untary can jump .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they must explain the refugees that it takes , and they can make the time useful , for example with language courses .
who would like to develop the feeling that he could not work anyone in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be un@@ profitable , he will never be able to integrate .
the clear majority is motivated .
there are also problem cases , but customer is honest , &quot; people , in which nothing goes wrong . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and Customer may therefore always be motivated to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : do the two after the recent accus@@ ations are afraid of radic@@ alization , even in a small church like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer very clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what man@@ cher nai@@ ve may call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a resi@@ dency could and if not to exclu@@ de it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these events are also subject to refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ in would carry them completely in ob@@ itu@@ ary .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so basic - and volunteer @-@ site must look for activities and in the region to activities .
so they always have in the background that a new thrust in refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a upper limit ?
to answer this question clearly , the policies shy .
actually , it is un@@ fair to place her hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived there , where we would like to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ b@@ acher was fully utili@@ zed to in@@ corporate the previous people .
these are currently around 100 persons , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no easy answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : a criminal dri@@ er for helicop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew different areas for approximately one hour .
two unknown men are violent on Friday at 8 : 50 a.m. on Friday morning in an apartment in a multi @-@ dwelling house in the Lin@@ den@@ weg path .
the residents surprised the two and struck the un@@ hol@@ den into the escape .
the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters , probably m@@ asked , both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ ded pul@@ s contributed .
they fled the city centre .
the police set a number of stri@@ kers , as well as a police helicopter .
the debt went without success .
perhaps the un@@ known indeed of the apartment fell close to the apartment and their escape .
