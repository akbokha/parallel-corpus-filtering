<seg id="11">He left his family with his family on the system of ALRV, on a horse he did not catch himself into photography.</seg>

<seg id="16">Federal Constitutional Cross, silver bay leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and the trade agreement TTP - we want to prevent both Clinton and the Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">The two US presidential elections are, however, in the tax and energy policy, as well as in a basic question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton lies a princiary, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The, about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to control the economy to death and regulate the economy, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be completely different, claimed Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will return regulations back massively, and he makes himself strong for a widespread tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, he has disadvantaged opportunities to open and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, taxes would increase taxes for the rich, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">To be invested in the manure, drump and Clinton say almost worshiped.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicants announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are rejected by the state-critical Teachy wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So in trump, party-internal discussions might be given.</seg>
<seg id="17">More significant are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal plants and drive coal into the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production is also expected to be possible in so far protected areas, to terminate the Paris Climate Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton wants to extend the renewable energies with their investment program, and demands: "a country will create the super power of the clean energy and create millions jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be China, Germany or America - I want us to be there." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only with the infrastructure - even with international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazifish trade agreement, do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both the US do not want to deal with international trade - but simply protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be paid better, calling for Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25US dollars is a starvation.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to increase it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump does to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be, he says, he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the control of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, trump, which aims to boost the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics hold him, so that the budget deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton says that at least the rich wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sexual violence is owned by women who flee alone, almost daily.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen, four women sit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby, which is at most a year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has laid her little son in his arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curious with big eyes in the room.</seg>

<seg id="11">She smiles short and kissed his little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene works normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speak to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is the area Managing Director of Condrobs, a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria, and deals with the theme of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are winged.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich North in one of the few decentralized accommodations for allpounded women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs made up the establishment with Pro Family and the Munich Women Aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men do not exist - as well as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is an wax before the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it is not exaggeration to say: every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence," "" "says Bahr." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "men flee to wars because they are politically persecuted because they are torture or death, or because their families send them as hope to Europe," "" "she tells." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">In women, other reasons were silent for the escape: "many will steal away, because they don't see any other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">In their homeland, they have made an experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honorary murder, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">That drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run, that goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, that the tugboat demand for a bottle of water is not a rarity," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who believe that the end as soon as they come to Germany, Irish, tells Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Even here women in refugee shelters would often be considered as mines and abused in a worst case.</seg>
<seg id="32">This leads to that about 90 percent of women living in the apartment in the Munich North, traumatized, estimates them.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntarily produced."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so familiar with that they say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "or they don't dare to speak openly about experiencing life, because the shame is too large." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they often do not help to help, more accommodations need for them, urges Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven district management boards are responsible for the placing of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question, whether they are using a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction, some with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Oberpfalz region and Oberfranken, there is no such thing in accomodations of the governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Schwaben, women were not accommodated separately alone, Karl-Heinz Meyer, Pressesprecher of the Government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Oberbayern, Lower and Central franken, there are only two storeys, or houses only for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">The committee "rights of women and equality of the sexes" in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "in a study published for the Committee, it says:" "" "it is very important that men and women can be accommodated separately." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "if the privacy or women are accommodated together, it may be too - ongoing - violence against women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Above all the shower room should be separately accessible, and for women easily accessible, stands in the study.</seg>
<seg id="47">How much the women feel the need for this protection, you can feel the same in the Andre, which there is at the house in Munich.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of State lateral"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that finished a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give his hands and an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish opposite in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg's Palace in reception, I cannot revert the intrucks that Ankara wants to most reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the hand, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile worked shameless and he radiated hardly heat, even for his restrained relationships.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke of his "dear Friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even better be improved.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper explained that Erdogan would have heard such an worst thing.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed to signify the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable kitchen showed that Russia's President of Russia had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduction: the downfall of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border by Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was burned.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin told and accused Ankara to have fallen into his back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The reason was even greater, as it was committed by a presumed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetropes is rebuilding up again, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the nationally controlled media led a sharp, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Once, it seemed like the Turks would carry guilty for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "the allegations of senior officials believed that Erdoğan would have benefited from illegal oil trade in the provinces of Syria, who will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">He disputed this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology of President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a cease-fire supply are clear.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs first all the friends that he can get after spending the last month in a failed coup d'etat.</seg>
<seg id="28">Terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey - especially the prohibition of charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal hionslaught of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the German TV-Billigeres predicted fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed to be allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti formulated this way:" "" "tourists stayed there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West, since it was response to the attempted power station as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">To do this, the persistent groll come across the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is pired on it, from the cool mood benefits and reduce the relation of Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, Russian state of state gained a bonus that he demanded the attempted coup d "état with the attempted coup d" état.</seg>
<seg id="40">That is good for Moscow, a comprehensiveness, which has to change themselves a profound fear of regimes.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey, as it once described me an analyst, "Alliance of Foreign Affairs": two countries which are dispersed by the West and well treated them badly.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, between the two still great differences exist.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently announced the role as peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support each other side.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be noted that after nearly three hours of first talks, both the presidents in the press conference said that they didn't even striped the topic.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey, however, failed to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus about where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect Disaster, when NATO member Turkey abolished the Russian fighter jet - it certainly is better that the two leaders talk at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="4">Ross McEwan shared the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand joined the Bank's global ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bank has since distanced itself, when it had to be cured almost eight years ago and had to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="6">At this time brand stratches "RBS" have used to protect other end consumer goods brands.</seg>
<seg id="7">It supported the international sports with millions of pounds to sponsoring, from the Six Nations Rugby to the Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.</seg>
<seg id="8">But now she has decided to focus more national brands into the focus.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland but will not be initialized.</seg>

<seg id="11">The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are other, smaller stamps for the private customer business that will get more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">McEwan was interviewed during a viewing tour of customers and employees in Inverness-Shire.</seg>

<seg id="15">When the Bank became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.</seg>
<seg id="16">I say now that we do not track global targets, but pursue local goals.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these trademarks will be completely different in their own congregations, and our employees will work among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already said that it will not continue its Six Nations Sponsoring, and that it will increase the perceptibility of various brands in its sports sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">"it is time for us to develop towards the bank of the brands, because how do we concentrate on inside (we asked) to make this a better bench for customers?" said the Executive Board.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical three years ago when we said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these stamps.</seg>
<seg id="21">But with our work, focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes.</seg>
<seg id="22">We can restart these stamps again, so I think that time has come.</seg>

<seg id="9">I am very happy that it's done with Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.</seg>

<seg id="12">Dettori takes the jubilation when he brings the victory at Predilection</seg>
<seg id="13">Two Jockeys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 times winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who reached more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.</seg>

<seg id="15">Frankie is one of the best jockey of modernity and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone, which only few before it reaches.</seg>
<seg id="16">He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect, distinguishing him from the other in weight control room.</seg>
<seg id="17">He has been a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma fans already for years for this sport.</seg>
<seg id="18">I said Frankie before a couple of weeks at Epsom that he had already fetched 6,000 profits if he wouldn't just had a weekend and big tournament jockey!</seg>
<seg id="19">Frankie had already lost nearly 30 years of winning players, which is great.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has a living person, which is good for a British race, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount</seg>
<seg id="22">From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the signboard of the British flat race for two decades.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was nerable.</seg>
<seg id="24">A whole range of big tournaments, including his famous "glorious seven" in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash, and received a drug ban.</seg>
<seg id="25">Three years ago he had encountered difficulties when he returned from his six-month lock, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to defy his branch and return to its top shape.</seg>
<seg id="26">And he is not yet in the end - Dettori said earlier, that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 50.000.000 years.</seg>

<seg id="5">In an opinion of the Kremlin, Putin is that Putin had ordered no indication "the dismissal Ivanovs of his duties as Chairman of the Russian President."</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been a deputy chairman since 2012, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital city Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in Tokyo's embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin website, it says (in Russian) that he later became a transitory leader and leader of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">Commenting on his appointment, he said to Putin: "thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the main task of the government to support your activity as state-chief of legislative and inspections to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov asked about to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces look for?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has been mysterious in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time of the closest confidant Vladimir Putin and works as he was for Soviet intelligence, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, both men were broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff came back on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, here are few of them convinced - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man, who once was surnamed as a potential president, would like to lead to Russian environmental policy - pushed attention to big scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, which are quoted on the website of the Kremlin, Ivanov said, "It's true that I asked you in early 2012 in a conversation, I could almost tell me this very complicated post - one could almost say - to trust in position four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been Chairman of the Russian President's President for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Before, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian security Council and how Putin was a former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), he was elected to the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power he called Ivanov as one of five people, whom he trusted.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that Ivanov would become president of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term of Putin would expel the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, near Allies Putto, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin was Prime Minister before he was elected president of three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>

<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of a engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30.000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that require extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, nearly 79% of the entire bridge decks in their place and last section of the deck is today in Rosyth a concrete shot for the deck, meaning that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to his place.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds Braunschweiger cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and Green foes my: investors will then be much stronger in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig in the next years will lose almost 1300 favorable apartments?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD proposes a "action concept living" for the next raternity.</seg>
<seg id="5">But controversy is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, the question is: who is supposed to build the favorable apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is lacking so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Christoph Bratmann said: "we agree with the Greens:" who wants to build on urban surfaces in the future, must notify 20 percent of all apartments as a social housing. "</seg>
<seg id="9">The inexpensive apartments, however, can also be created in the continuance.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the large number of forces in the city hall was, however, says Frmann: "how do you deal with investors who want to build on private homes?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 percent of these areas, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments are building as a social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new residential residential construction programme, which will cost millions and has to be financed, shall provide incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem so Bratmann: "there are still no agreement between the fractions."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors a few rules as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Left will still want toughness for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of its, so Bratmann, can be introduced to the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action plan is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the building management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yet the program doesn't open completely: for the around 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you compare the loss of some 1,300 affordable dwellings, whose promotion will run out in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020, it will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, the planing policy of Nicole's Palm, should now be redeemed to be purchased from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought to bring apartments back into the price binding.</seg>

<seg id="27">Because at the end of the western city, the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments you could bring back into the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: we do not want the owners, the housing companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social apartments in the west city has drastically increased, it is removed from the target of the so-called mixing.</seg>
<seg id="31">A concentration of social weak in just a few neighbourhoods will not give it any more.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens are expecting it to be more moving in discussion.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness, that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">Teenagers and child to play no longer go out to play, but rather rather prefer to spend their free time on display, on display, has been complained by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go there is to get people from the sofa and get more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the beginning of the screen it was limited to TV, then on video games and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore, it's great to see that technology and activities not close mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I am moving forward to Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later from it a cartoon series, playing cards and other Spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of pop culture fell in front of the game's release in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within days Pokémon Go more users as Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go out with their smart phones and search for Pokémons that are followed with a GPS and once they were found once, "photographed" (about a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, the game led to a considerable increase of steps which dates the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Carogram, an app for Apple Watch, the 35,000 users postponed, shared the Washington Post recently with that within two days after the introduction of the game, the number of following people followed by 45 per cent to 53 percent each day.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon go - it merely looks the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public reconnaissance campaigns for the health, people who want to take care of "30 minutes" to come "from the sofa" and "to be active" every day "beat on deaf ears because many public messages come to health and come from people who look like.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports can not be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly drives sport, reduces his odds to treat cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine and fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people join the hunt even new friends.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, well-indrical toys, which have always been complaining about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should I do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough has happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit earlier could follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sports, as does this game do.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "the new will lose its appeal and use the use of time." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons success, there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the activites of the real world and helping many people on hunting, more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="11">Their total score of 62,198 was clearly found in front of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team kameradin Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal in Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Americans of Simone Biles came to the Swedish Baltic during the second competition of the women at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual player, which wins a combined fight, and altogether the fifth, while they consolidate their reputation, the best of their generation, or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She broke out in tears as their final result was shown and her long journey took place at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">She introduces it to the same league, such as Michael Phelps, who brought their sports up to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles dominates her sport in the last three years, including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that have a mixture of ambition and precision that she said "the best gymnast is that I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It was expected to be a final test in Brazil, a competition that didn't go so much between fine and the rest of the athlete, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered disappointment.</seg>

<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on the top of their long road to the top, never to have the future planned, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - which included its typical tumbling pass, is tailored to Latin American music that would suit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a little child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school tour in the gym hall, was trained in the Boorman.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since summer 2013 she has lost no more competition competition, a victory of victory, which will hold so long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafina led by two revolts slightly, the image collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pig beams and soil particles - in which Biles holds the world title.</seg>
<seg id="28">She repeated again with 15,433 on the pig, and sat on the ground with a 15.933 on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman stirred her gently when she expected her Endergness - a pure formality - and tears poured on fine red, white and blue Eyeliner, when the vision described it once in her collection book, to reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance Raismans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal was in a Tiebrake to Mustafina.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I present under the women's olympiamity in the gymnasshopper and that of more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I have been so dominant in 1984 at every summer Olympics and the USA were never so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three Turnermen, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess is and Madison Kocian, the Katholikine is round, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the United States.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has strengthened the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">Over the last four years the number one was one Afro-Americans.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year was Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is showing strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and the America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of three times world championship in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they were unexpected, but masterfully Gymastics were provided.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual men who won gold with an individual combined event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Man member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but do not see gym classes in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie beat all the same way as Aly and Madison, to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympiad will only have four turists in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But reality looks like that Turnen is a more expensive sport and Turner first line in private gym, which are maintained by parents, which will rise from parents, competition, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their Turner and families). the list lets you continue.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turnouts are in wealthy suburbs that can help business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, Turner will receive its entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both her athletes, since they started with the Turning.</seg>
<seg id="22">We must unite the congregations Aun countless, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easy-to-reach gym training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gyms version of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">During my events, we have set free and affordable Turning in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth (mainly black and hispanic), and national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth of high quality gymnastics that make the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turning develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and consistency for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as training and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that make thousands of young girls to care for the Turning and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in the sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is so exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this genuine representation of "Girl Power" by the wood of the Olympic team gold and thank you, for so many young girls with different background motivates to begin their way to start healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make him safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We spoke with Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to move with armed fighters to close distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or back, this video will show you how you turn the skewer for your predator.</seg>
<seg id="5">When you turn back from behind, then you should be turned into turn, so that you can see your attacker and get "from the Fire line," says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the gun then between your forearm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free elbows.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then hit him with the knee in the bar and rotate, while the attackers come together with pain, the weapon out of his hands. beat him with the barrel and move backward, while they address the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">At attackers, approaching from the front, technology is similar - move your body from the casting line, take the weapon and rotate it, so that the attacker can't shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, put the weight on the weapon and beat the attacker on the chest, then turn the weapon out of its grip, before moving forward and set the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>
<seg id="11">Watch the video to see exactly how it does Mizrachi prepower.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller undertook the immune system and the reteflex of a serious test - putting some of the dirt and most adhered place in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and itinerant Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk will scrape its wake up on a euro note, a banister on the Piccadilly Circus, a rinse knob of a train toilet as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before removing any object, he used a luminometers in order to show oneself and show us what he will be introduced.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title of The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, brought some surprising results of daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought to push the rinsist of a drawback, which was already used by thousands others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact, there is more poor bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright said with doctors and medical specialists on promoting intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left, that he stretched out, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intestine by travelling through the world and ate peculiar as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railways to train stations to dishwashers of toilets, the task proved its immune system definitely among a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he told:" "" "as a child I was relatively unworried about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and sludge." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was justified in his call.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he dismissed was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its probeabouts showed a luminometric survey of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the Luminometer number is freshly washed hands less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to escape after their Luminometer numbers amounted to more than 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have a less than 60 units</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy produce valio produced the travel time "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says," "" "This is the worst thing I have gerred in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not going to lick up here because it is indoors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength "was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producers of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Company equips Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the encouragement of intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer the consumer really something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating about looking at and simultaneously explains the advantages of Probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We led a crazy brainstormings so that we were saying, "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in human health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and with the documentary we could provide more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense for humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the film directing, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had checked some of the things I had directed to him, like the disguised Russian toilet that will be shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things, with which it was easier to get Ian, to lease it and others, with which this was pretty difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats in film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In one of the survey conducted by the year 2015, 84 percent of all respondents with lactic acid bacteria and 58 percent reported that they use at least occasionally products that contain lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="3">With us a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="4">A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story," Leornard Bernsteins masterpiece.</seg>
<seg id="5">The artistic director of Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring music in the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Maria.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the orchestra, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra conducted by Gustavo Dudamel: "this music is full of rhythm," he is warmed.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say they are very Latin American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we really have a lot of music in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this staging, Bartoli plays an older brother Maria.</seg>
<seg id="12">She remembers her lovers with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary has always been fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">First, because it is exceptional!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then Marias Personality would be.</seg>
<seg id="16">She says she's in her song: "I McPretty, oh so Pretty, I McPretty and White and Bright."</seg>
<seg id="17">It is so clever, of course also naïve, and very passionate.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it resembles me very, my Italian character I have as Römerin," laughs Bartoli.</seg>

<seg id="23">Conducting is a necessity for him.</seg>
<seg id="24">One sees it in every of his movements, in his glances, it's his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">It is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him.</seg>
<seg id="26">We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and a cheerful approach to life, that is very important at all!</seg>

<seg id="2">Seltsames Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals can get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the tourists from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they have understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">By 2021, the country code will not again take place at the end of the summer holidays, the heavy parliament decided by the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">As stupid as so far it is not: summer holidays, heat and country sessions - that bites.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals who are supposed to be convinced of the fighters are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the holidaymakers who are in the country are on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not the locals, not allowed to choose the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="8">These are practical problems: in the holidays there are helpers that hang on posters, air balloons, flyers and put out at the end of the votes cast out only mühevoll.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass over to the people over the people over a day.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot stage, if one can say it at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must be feared for his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting, how strongly newcomer AFD cut and what remains left at the end of the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008, makes an almost unobtrusive election campaign, one sees his major posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, spread roses and chatted a little with the people, as it did already his legendary former predecessor Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, seafering has received cold feet and is Chancellor Merkel's fault on the bloom of AFD.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her refugee policy, you "We do" have to accelerate the rise of populists, which is thought to cost him expected.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, the Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make the right place for the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited two Angela Merkel chancellor Angela Merkel; Merkel member in the North East.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as a Mecklist and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was probably the majority from other federal states," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it is too bad to anyone from Germany's other corners to listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Apart from that, the Nordost-CDU is largely on the usual campaign sites and shopping malls with parasols and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">That, like Kokert, plays only one "subordinated role."</seg>
<seg id="25">Also the union has noticed that on the country you need to burn the base it must be very strict, again to find a wire to the people.</seg>
<seg id="26">You are just like the left, the SPD, the green: in the land of the country barely there is.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the Council of the CDU-election fighter Kokert to his fellow soldier is also self-larvingly: "you have to go there where it hurts, namely where people are: Dorffeste, Golden Weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because there is a lot on the game, Sellering has invoked his SPD to a particularly dedicated election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, the Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent of partner CDU (25) and just under the AFD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the election of 2011, the SPD won still clearly by 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, Kleinpartei with seven percent in the polls, will create the leap in the land tag.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue of holidays in the holidays of a holiday and transfer their campaigns to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online campaign" is the state president Claudia Müller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise green election battles on Spurensche to native crustaceans among the holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gaek, the top candidate, curvt straight with a houseboat lakes and finds it even beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="36">Your impression: "voting holiday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a penalty."</seg>

<seg id="2">At speed, with which the B is 27, there is nothing to complain.</seg>

<seg id="8">Commended also the discharge of those responsible for the construction workers, such as it comes to the establishment of heating drives.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site started on Monday to the south, and also the lock of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rotor has returned, the traffic situation became relaxed within the resort.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now move from Ofterdingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>

<seg id="12">"there were partly significant complaints," says the Deputy Assistant Vice-Manager, Florian King.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachar Strait, Steinlachstraße, oharbour street and consecurain had to fight with more traffic noise because many shots were sought and rather trusted in their Navi as the signs.</seg>

<seg id="22">However, that the B 27-restructuring has led to revenue in revenues, each one asks you to pass through.</seg>

<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">That is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only him, but all the restaurants I met "hard."</seg>

<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, the policy would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, government president Jörg Schmidt cited on a request by Göhner, whether it could give a financial compensation to the reference, the inn benefited by the advantages of the location on the B 27. now she has to put the disadvantages, which result in the restoration.</seg>

<seg id="11">After recent attacks in Würzburg, and Ansbach, de Maizière gave a little time, before he presents his conclusions to the Republic's safety in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="12">But these are the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot is already known, announced that a new security authority is to take care of the crack encrypted communication, is not new.</seg>
<seg id="14">Not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU directives for passenger data and weapons.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and staff for security agencies are also not surprising.</seg>

<seg id="18">He still hold this for reasonable and demands nothing, which has no chance at the coalition partner.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas are presented by Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">They are partly in themselves: it is planning rapid method for shifts and more possibilities to uphold people from deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted targeted towards the country should open their smartphones and open social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Dulce for the past asylum seekers, he wants to prove some worse than so far - such, the offences go away or throw away their papers in order to divise their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">A lot of it is political and legal.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some also works unbalanced and makes questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points - in the imitation of granulment for example - the question arises: what does that actually have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, de Maizière says it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it is not possible to speak in demostration that the assassin of Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">There are also many people in view of the high refugee pay for security.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that are deeply busy, had not let themselves out in election campaign times.</seg>

<seg id="36">In the past days, it went up between the two parties.</seg>
<seg id="37">Only a garrisky dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then on a security policy collection of some Unions's interior ministers in which the Ressortchefs also call a Burka ban and a return from double citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière is boasting a lot of conciliatory notes.</seg>

<seg id="30">VW has adopted the guarantee that fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motor performance after conversion does not take any deterioration and have all the relevant vehicle values remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Volkswagen itself uses the term "guarantee" but not as it was in corporate travel.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the wide term "guarantee" Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers for example a half a year after the upgrade with a motor damage to a workshop - and this could lead to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is also important to avoid the customer's interest in case of any other damages, which have nothing to do with the gassay scandal, with regard to possible warranties, as it was called.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who does not buy sound plates?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men love medium-aged plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you spy on comment, in order to overlook him under the pseudonym non-allele-related people, this statement runs from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the multitudes of records are not based on a boom in millennials to welcome the unity of physical objects, but due to mid-life-nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record recently, are all pressive to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely weathering group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes through hobbies. it has an emotional meaning: older platform seat retain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to spend time (69% vs 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you agree with the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on TV, I would like to follow the camera while in the middle of a busy street in Soho run, a humble grey suit and a wild, before I stand, my hands hold and somewhat more determinant like: "so, let us take a close look."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at them.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of SoHos slowly stumble at its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were based - there are still a handful of fantastic record shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the camera man to turn the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores up and try to estimate their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I think of Sister Ray (s): two young women, three men of middle ages, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of an encounter in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I wonder?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess already," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 albums.</seg>
<seg id="17">This records, pictured above (he has sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not followed by him), dressing up the walls of his residence.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he possesses such considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: it is now able to buy records, which he could not afford, when she appeared and again sold items that he sold, when he was young and pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I probably had too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He is true that those who buy records are rather introverted and would like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25 who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers that he meets, meeting the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and decided to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the talks I have led, people usually were emptted by their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers that once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom on the post-revivals of a specific age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like phonica to realize that record shops offers a soothing community of peers.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some of the older clients participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw the stability of trusted records covers, of objects, happy excreations.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or property of material possessions than a kind of consolation," says Wez.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal with spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" soldered a staff of a record stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month they haven't heard it yet.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey was found out that 41% have a turntable that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, have no turntables.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried while passing through a stack of Bossa Nova comedy.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (data, three men of medium-age), has noticed a "trophy" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just returned here and said," I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a radio record, so I can set it into the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musician.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no turntables."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, which only work slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has devoted the sound plates almost a whole floor, has a blower audience, when I go to clean.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and women middle-aged.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is something less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops, Wild Beasts's latest synthesiology and sexist packaged pop, instead of experimental jazz, it is good to see such diversity in the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks strange, but brand psychological traumata are badly detectable if one stands next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes in business and looks at the Varietrack for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It's more a paddle bumblebee as a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not deserve much, therefore, collecting records are not a real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from one computer or in other ways, but the beauty of records is... "she drives with a loved sighs.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of turnlogiants: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the certificate that jeans in the pants, I awoke up a group of young teenage girls, who just group for a moment about Polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter consider to buy a Crosley turntables.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essentials for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees them - perhaps because they are just purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to write them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry, and to send some customers to the depths SoHos for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research shows that the results of YouGov vote, they, at least in record stores in Soho, which exist a large number of female collectors and turntables which exist in reality, turntables and online.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning not with a boasting by record shops of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they reach the stubborn gaze of a uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who rises above the shoulders of nothing aged middle-aged old age.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court has rejected a bid by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live down.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a trial hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be trapped in 72 provisionally, selling hair services or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or easy meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be broken down because they would not be able to represent a parallel economy, which would not be paid to taxes, and the risk of fire and sanity.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups, not sufficient food for growing numbers in the camp would offer.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition, they carried out that the provisional shops and restaurants often would offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate 72 temporary businesses, but cleared evidence that the concerns of the Calais prefecture are absolutely immeasurable. "</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean François Molla said that the food shops, cafes, and restaurants would play a much bigger role than people who live in extremely precarious conditions. "</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that areas have a quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the precipitation was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated and 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as a consulting on asylum causes for the hundreds of vulnerable children in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170.000 people signed the petition to keep the kids' café.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure of "for these children were a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years old are."</seg>
<seg id="13">The two aid agencies Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated that the number of people in the jungle camp has risen to more than 9.000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase of newcomers throughout the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain during the 7-er Rugby came to a broken stop at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were struck with a score of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Fiji, a master class in the handling, side stepping, descending, line-up and roher strength to win gold - their first Olympic Medal has any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was dispatched by the non-poor trot prize of silver medal - British fourth on that day - and they were able to be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The significant defeat of the boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back to the finals.</seg>
<seg id="6">But independently of this, in this form, a 15-man team had been cut in top shape.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but will probably not - that at least one Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck: Fijis boss Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult way behind.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, she lost under Ryan every game at Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This cap is blowing, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Fiji the attacks of GBS kicked off from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt like the captain Tom Mitchell to and Co. to run into driving buses. the World Series winner went 5-0 upwards, when Osea Kolinisau landed in the corner.</seg>

<seg id="16">A prefix Tackle Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third goal, but it has only stopped in Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua had a touch-down in the right corner and it stood at 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new time since the resumpfiff and there was still about a minute season... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou preached by further weak Tacings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji had been born to play the 7, while Britain still had to be used.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is like that.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes to half-time and closed the fijivian gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova went through a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started a trial for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7 but the game went for a long time in favour of the South Korean consulate, whose fans sang, swapping and danced on the tribune.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more engine gold than with these games, and that will be hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke of up to the last, 220 hard hieve, who go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in her golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only those who were sitting at the rod, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was more present than they were invited to the second Olympic champion in the branch without tax woman, the first women in the history of the British sport that put on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolute, at least their 39.ter unlagged use, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athlete, who glimpse on the surface with the elegance of swings, which does not reflect the type of trium.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing is a battalion to helping helpers who make the difference, and there was no one remedy than the coach who would survive 30 months ago if he was diagnosed this day when cancer was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer who is operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do it, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little bit the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could begin treatment in early 2014, out of season, beginning to start a minimum, in case that is the correct term under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was at the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="18">That is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing is already a challenge, but that makes it a greater challenge.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the inability of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerable morning doing something more than usual, trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning who was in use as a leader in the Royal Artillery regiment in Afghanistan, "I used this week an emotional wreck. that's maybe something extremly, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is repeated only, how much I mean, how much I and Helen and also have worked with Robin.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we wouldn't have anything, therefore a massive thanks go to him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would have no better person for coaching or better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any race over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm, with which their opponents didn't help.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to stop, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process, unleash in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to get rid of itself.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not doing something rabies.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted no fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover has to appear next week on a wedding, her own with TV-adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that my last race was.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London, it took about six months to realize that I am a Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>

<seg id="21">Just older people who live alone, don't just want to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through the singing in choir, Hackler mean.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>

<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 sinks people, who is listening to it when a tone is next?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the appropriate offer, Seniors various possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If anyone sings of the reputation in a veteran enchor, you can just join them.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf the sewerage fee will then be increased later than once again, if appropriate improvement is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a relevant calculation, the sanitation price in Azendorf will be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser reported (CSU), the approval of the budget was determined by the Office of the Office of Kulmbach for these sewage plants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Market Kasendorf is obligated due to the correct foundation to cover the facilities.</seg>
<seg id="6">From 1 October 2016, the citizens and the industrial and industrial companies from Welthigh, Neudorf, reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg have to attack deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The rate increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Head of Herbert Schmidt's Board of Directors, a new calcalulation of the fees for the sewage plant was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, there are also overseas and covers from the previous calendar period.</seg>
<seg id="10">In order to establish the excavators increases, Schmidt settled in all three sewerage facilities around relatively small establishments with a very low wage waste, which fly between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Thus, due to the low distribution system, expenses for the repair of several thousand Euros would be graceful.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the sewerage is slightly declining in all three plants.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in the backdrop period in all three systems were not least reported due to its age of sanitation and repair applications in a substantial extent.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for cattery, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt pointed out that at the sewerage of Azendorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the pumping station, the nearly 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled and in the pond-stop Lopp, after almost 20 years, the first sewage treatment is discharged, the sewage sludge is disposed and an additional aeration facility can also be installed in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenditure came into account for these extraordinary expenditure and maintenance costs, which are considered to be considered in the new calendar period."</seg>
<seg id="18">Same applies to electricity costs associated with the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 clearly below the current level.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the low wage waste in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance "is fully enforced."</seg>
<seg id="20">In this case, Schmidt added, the market congregation of great entertainment costs remained in the past 20 years.</seg>

<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed issues in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government agencies have given orders to change reports, it shows how analysts saw the pressure from their prelaws, an optimized picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or Isil.</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements prior to the Congress were clearly more positive than it represents the facts."</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, CentCom was publicly known that a military return of Mossulphur could already begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, second largest city in Iraq, continues under control of the Islamic State.</seg>

<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by detailed insights during the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="17">Additionally, further investigation of CentCom reports are underway by the Chief Inspector of the Defence Ministry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the news conference published on Thursday their own findings agreed with some of the Republican Task Force conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in the years 2014 and 2015, CentCom created a superior process for the creation of redirecting assessments on Isil and Iraqi security services," "" "given the highest level of Democrat in the Committee, member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">This process, so Mr. Schiff, "was delayed the publication of redirecting reports," abolished the morality under analysts and "gave a little space for dissenting opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no evidence of an intervention of the White House at CentCom Analyst in regard to a certain political opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="22">Preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday through "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">In August, the New York Times reported investigations by investigators of the Pentagon, who were accepted following complaints by CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press briefing of the Pentagon, announced in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress while the investigations of the General Assembly could still be underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also believed that "experts are sometimes forgable opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data, and that the Intelligence and Defence Ministry have a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have continued repercussions about the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a assertion which is now made by a growing number of relatives of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the allegations of last year, however, have raised the question in which President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State recall the disputes of more than ten years ago when a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, foreseen a scripture in Iraq and saw a little time on the occasion of objection to the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the insurrection against the current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after having shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockeyteam of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said it could not remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to people who keep their goals in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is what they know: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Britons on the first place that undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last round of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have qualified for the quarter-final, the game will decide which the two teams will reach the first and second place within their group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed competition is going to be a little bit longer from the way to the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always, the game is going out on Saturday, the Americans triggered a surprising thing about their success story, four years after they landed in the last London games on the last of 12 squares.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey racket in hands (their two older sisters played the Sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became the National Champion of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008, as they could not qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, where she and her team went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things for better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a cultural change, an mental change and a physical change," said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the working time in London we have now.</seg>
<seg id="18">We've got the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the torches in the first half of the game with a setback.</seg>
<seg id="20">India was without victory in the tournament, but the team showed up surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">It took a Sprint with a flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and lute the ball into the gate to make a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the tournament for the keepers of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in any of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">She has a run.</seg>

<seg id="1">Midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, Zen of the Trampolins</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late as it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel durable and inescapable, a fast-paced relay between competition and streams.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning rod, which is promoted by Armbrustinate for Turner to triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't listen to the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbors in the coffee shop without talking about Simone Biles, Katie Lecovery or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there are Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a gyms with dimples, could definitely have been under this known name, built for Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being-on-TV advertising, if he would be a swimmers, Turner or even Fill.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame doesn't lit every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognised: airpistons shoot, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always swim the breast and let it rule long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should make a modest arguments to my particular favorites, let me direct your attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampolines have been a Olympic event ever since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it became apparent over the last 16 years so many that I asked, did not know that it is a Olympic portart.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampolines and until 2012 had a athlete who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prizes for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal in London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain external side charm, partly because it sounds for the unchecked ear, suitable for a clownsnursery than for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a feast of enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorously potential - the cartoonous tremor of his never-going astray - but also the Grazie of the Turnaround and diving, the two sports that combines it essentially.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, meaning a lot of" "" "springboard." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Aspiring winner jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and must landing a number of falling movements (turning, pireal and salaries) before they landing at the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are evaluated according to the official Olympiad after execution, difficulty, and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists hopes to continue in their quest for gold, faster, upwards and over, sometimes up to the destination, sometimes go and back, upwards and down at the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They hunt only the finish line or the output wall, but in the TV-transmission also another great goal: the world or the Olympic-ords.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted pursuit is nobel, admired, even fanatically - and it is enough to touch even a spectator.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I experienced during these games as a little tiresome.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing spell.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampolines is top.</seg>
<seg id="32">A downward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she prallish, seemingly heavy as an astronaut, goes upward, then down to the top, then effortlessly return to the top.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty but during practice there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves rave into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant uplifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's so Zen as the competition can only be with the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final results of the women will be held on Friday afternoon, at the Streaming about 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also around 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the end as part of a afternoon blocks of two days at 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one who probably will see in general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If consciousness increases only through the anxiety and objectivity of male athletes - as it proposed the male US Turner, according to The Wall Street Journal, Mr Dooley expects his to be a new fanbase.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protest" in Ethiopia, Long one of the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protest in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters and the political changes in Ethiopia are calling for the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that zig protesters during the clashes with policemen were killed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia straight together?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ban of West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the past few months protests against the government shook the country and spread themselves in more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people fell on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's response was inmerciful to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot dead protesters and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos on the protests, probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security experts young people have to strike with sticks, while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The chief of the UN authority for human rights requires an incoming investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to hold this country and in future it will even become more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the leader of the Horn of Africa from the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country of Africa and its stability is estimated to be the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror across the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable tempo.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital of Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been reduced, being dissentencing to silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile, or imprisoned in prison, or driven into the wilderness of the wilderness.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and don't have other options to protest out, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation are protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints, which cover everything from land use up to appreciation in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widespread election last year, the ruling party and its allies have received the last seat of the Opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, voltages along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this zacky, disputed line required hundreds of life in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts believe that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which were forced more or less forced in recent years, could use turbulence and could be armed.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of provocation after years before Hinkuckles were exploding under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate via the social media, since cheaper smartphones have always been more common and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government has closed access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially in protests, do many people still talk about Internet Proxies that hide where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians found that they were so much assembled at the protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since eons prospering the Amharas, the predominantly Christian countries come from the Aegean sea, in politics and economy, while they live the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and in lowlands.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen," Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests were held in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which account for around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, in the secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was sentenced to death for 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister until his death in a non-public disease in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was viewed as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was especially united in it, to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and use special assigned to process opponents and make them harmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime is missing on this fundamental skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively unknown reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of the Northern Ethiopian, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he can't enjoy the trust of the Tigray controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had such an uproar in 2005, after thousands against elections were protested by the government, who, according to data, was apparently stolen by the government and stolen away afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raids, many protesters were killed, even if it were less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not prevent Intensification of the internal misconception of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month the protesters in Gondar, a Jamaican city, owned by Tigray and hatred toward the Tigray will always become more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that protests the US and other Western allies bring into an independent position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The US government used Ethiopia as a basis for demnity over the neighboring Somalia, even if they were recently closed that it closed the basis.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West wants to support democracy clearly, he doesn't want his bundle in a already volatile area.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim that Obama was founded "Sarkasmus"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy on Friday that his campaign claims that his several times repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification threw new questions on the communication skills of the Presidential candidate of the Republicans to see whether he was able to communicate with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his fellowsoldier, who endeavoured to take him during an eventful phase in protection, in the formal position, which he could not mean.</seg>
<seg id="5">After he had made the suggestion for a election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump answered in terms of the assertion on Thursday and existed in interviews that he really didn't intend to indicate the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was just sarkastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">Contrary to the previous day Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation completely seriously.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to relieve the testimony that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the republican candidate wanted nothing to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism fell down to Mr. Trump, while he tried to direct his campaign to direct economic conditions on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches to the business situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried again to return to this issue.</seg>
<seg id="12">Commenting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes, and that he found their speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July, he attracted strong criticism when he said that the Russians should be killed by Mrs. Clinton Emails, but later he said, "Of course I meant the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows to move Mr. Trump to shift the language boundaries in politics and then return on demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "I think it's one of his methods to test such as certain messages from his fans, as they are arriving, and then, if necessary," "" "said Ruth Sherman, a communication sexist who observed the language of both candidates." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he is clever enough to keep his statements, so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of sharpening the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted a corrosive sound, as its demand would go further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, published on Friday, a guided tour with a huge margin in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and head-on-head-race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying to apologize for his provokant pronouncements, he accuses his critics to concede his statement or misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he has strengthened the focus of attention in the past months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps treats his loyal co-scattering into the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provokant his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps most prominent princesses, had great efforts to defend candidates today in a CNN-interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "Mr. Giuliani said he was questioned about the correctness of Mr. Trumps, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense true that Barack Obama was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backtling, completely wrong and so it happened because he moved the troops out of Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as an Foreign Minister, ISIS allowed ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East is aggressive under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">In front of the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and threw them to return on any of his words and to be voiced.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he defied the" "" "poor," "" "TV experts who try to understand and said," "" "You can't." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest cyclone is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">More rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland we usually come to the surface only in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This hai was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a fine 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhaie was only getting up with 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely walks along the North Atlantic along the bottom of the North Atlantic, an average of 1,220 metres in an hour.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes to it, the five metre long animal accelerates at a whopping 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">This kind of loneliness is characterized by long life, but seems to be a patent for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the professional journal "Science" at any age of Greenland, who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock commented on this lifespan, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the Evolutionsbiologist probably suspect that Greenland are stonstone.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence is missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's haunt are hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water-temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually dive in the winter only in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers provide a little bit of the lifestyle of Greenland researchers.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her time-pentine is known, when she gave six animals with a station in front of Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, this sharks make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another one had swallowed up the jaw of a young polar bears.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt sleepy animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice cream and are looking for cadaver, which torches from higher water layers down to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland haunt, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitzbergen from the North Atlantic's depth.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest Hai was just 81 centimeters long while the biggest 502-centimetre measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of animals, it analyzes the lens of the sharks with the Carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This center of the eye lens emerges already before the birth of sharks, which contained in the proteins later, will no longer be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks were strikingly high Carbon-14 in the lens-core.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the early 1960s, after the early 1960s, larger quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere was worse.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the 220-centimeters long, the lens of the lens contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In their lens-core, all larger Greenland we had normal carbon-14 amounts due to cosmic rays of the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the Carbon-14 clock for a 493-centimetre was an age of 335 years, while the record Hai with 502 centimeters should be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Grönlandhai-females first got offspring when they are more than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now, the researchers were able to arrange a age.</seg>
<seg id="31">As one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood on the threshold for sexual maturity and its age was 156 years old, Greenland with the reproduction of at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this is likely to be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusales live mainly in icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211 years old Grönlandwal, washed at the neck of the neck a 120 year-old harpoon top, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to low temperatures, the organism is often living on the flame of sparks.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and albeit slow.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly big.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface, due to the animal heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on making many offspring as soon as possible as possible," "" "explains the evolutionary Biologist Schrous lein as soon as possible." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Schottlands Callum Skinner's last evening in the mouth team sprint in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the scroll of his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy. the young and made the legend proud when he stormed to home a victory of the Favorites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed four years ago, while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick once in March at the subway World Championships in London despite the return of Hoys, only a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as executions.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired a gap that tried to close Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man, with whom they stayed, when they saw the potential in the gravel, which now unfolds.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - the last four years ago with Hoy victorious - and Skinner put into the Qualification round a Olympic Stadium, but in the standings winning the New Zealander in the first lap.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his turn left behind, but Kenny brought the team to the front and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A strategy change made a large part of transformation, in which the passing of a higher speed drove it to slow down and it Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked back from his position as a BBC expert and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hindes, when they went to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it is a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I am just here to do my best and make a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We have set a Olympic record in the Endrunde and defeats the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just amazing.</seg>

<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on the page Kenny and Hoys, Hinds were admitted that he fell after a weak start to the train.</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no appeal by Englands Rivalen.</seg>
<seg id="22">This time there was no problem with such a superior victory.</seg>

<seg id="24">We have joined the team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we are expecting successful five days at Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the shape of Kenny, it is in the realm of possible that he repeats the victory of three Olympic medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on March 23 (a apparently holy date for British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) were born, a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">The coming from Hoy is equal.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint part, which begins today and will start over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "I enjoy this just for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels somewhat embarrassing, alone to win.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he won two gold medals, he should become a knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were some good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualifier with the fastest performance in the four-four kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51,942 at the finish line.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record that won gold in 2012 was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition at the Wiggins with safety in focus.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had fought yesterday with the qualification before the qualification, when the functionaries were called to measure his body-size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the appropriate women competition, resumed tomorrow, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald von Milngavie in the world record in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on his strong train team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and take a stake to medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio have been shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">They played dramas in the background, so the resignation of the technical Leiters Shane Sutton in April were in the midst of sex and mobingles, as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if you see the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like that the legendary call GBS, who has reached the perfect moment of its climax, can be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand on the game, as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contracts, and thereby raise all the delivery contracts, as provided by the provided energy company.</seg>

<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa completed the Point Henry melt, which led to a closing of the Anglesea force last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risked a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australia dollar and last due to the power price for the installation.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which delivers big aluminium tubs with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latin America, shared with that three other owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The facility is located in the majority of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp will keep smaller shares.</seg>

<seg id="14">AGL continued to say that the "securing transactions" were to be entered into force from November 2016.</seg>

<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, it was therefore not good in hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was quite clunky.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory was eight megabytes at first, which would suffice today for about two selfies high resolution.</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "the" "" "Nokia 9000 Communicator" "" "came exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, into the shops - and it was the first smartphone." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few euros, lovers will still buy the equipment on the Internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="11">20 years ago, the communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone producer had announced the product a few months earlier than the Cebit computer fair in Hanover as "office in the West-format format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent for then a lot: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax was the communicator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even accessing web pages was possible by HTML browser, when too slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen was found.</seg>
<seg id="18">Quite proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average price of smartphones in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could have seen in August 1996 that communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow is not only in our local community and throughout London, but throughout the country renewal and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="3">For me this was the biggest attraction in Heathrow, just like that in 2012 in London, when we run a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions profited from the games.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympiad brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will come back by creating new possibilities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities we will already present 10,000 new teachers, 40,000 new jobs and prepare for youth unemployment in the airport's air environment.</seg>
<seg id="7">As they were ahead in London 2012, there will be such that the challenge of the extension of Heathrow is too large.</seg>
<seg id="8">I told me that England will never be ready for the games and we will blamate ourselves on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to winds, but Heathrow responds to every question.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games Heathrow is for many and not for individual infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Expansion is an option to create up to 180.000 new jobs, to create £211 billion in total growth and leave a legacy of skills and jobs in order to leave the airport as well as in all UK.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure program in time and budget, from T5 - which was elected five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, built up to T2, which was built in the midst of the two performance catwalk of the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion to private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">London's London games were a great success for UK and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms, which resemble from climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have recorded similar conditions with their hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow shift of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, allied atmosphere, and turned on slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also lit the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably pointed out more dry places than Earth, but had once enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and shake off faster evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from a sun which was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow change of Venus is exposed to its daily side of the Sun nearly two months," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio stated in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which seems like an umbrella seems to block the surface of a large part of the sun heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought a history of Venus, which resembles the evolution that has been suspected of Planetenexplored.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was presumably inhabitable, the Venus -- exposed to much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans are evaporated and their water vapor was burned down by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogen, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide withdrew from a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which as we know them today.</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail-malware rely on targeted companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a current survey conducted by the malware Test Specialists Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies surveyed have been at least once, partly several victims of a attack with blackmailing software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have already reached the target of a ransoming blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims were willing to pay the solution requested by the offences to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The offender specialise their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially-pressing solution is considerably higher than with private uses.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of damage software," explains Malwarebytes-chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators found the perpetrator software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private use were the target, but the change to company attacks took place in the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once a victim's computer, it is searching for unlong-changed files such as Word-, Excel- or database files as well as to archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files are encrypted and deletes the originals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently the software presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the final turnkey code to the files, the victims need money - mostly in the form of Bitcoin-Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where with private use the personal photo database is on the game, companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut.</seg>
<seg id="17">Correspondingly, the damage is due when a ransomyware fails.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses by Ransomites, 13 percent had to completely interrupt their business activities in a case of risk.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals of attacks had already been threatened by the loss of nurse.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims," "" "Do not pay, you have only the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of the companies who pay, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">Managers are difficult to refuse in view of the perpetrators, in view of a standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hacker again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study the researchers of F-Secure analyzed the user interfaces and contact with the blackmailing lists and come to the result: the perpetrators actually try to build a kind of customer service to increase more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims per chat, as they can pay per Bitcoin, send free support websites or decrypt free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And they will be saved by individuals from a few hundred euros, companies must pay partly hard-negotiate and five-digit sums to repay their data.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ranks of the ranks, the hackers will always be professional and share the work, explains security experts Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a ransoming about within a week."</seg>

<seg id="32">The blackmail then look for further hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you log in one of the forums in the underground, buy the set of a crime and instructing a further order to install the software on as many PCs.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per rified machine.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually, the criminals then bear spammer with the spread," "" "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomyware is now known for many companies that make their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 per cent of the companies responsible for companies in the Malwarebytes survey are able to rely on the ransoming through file-back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat for successful Erpessung more, the perpetrators are instead described with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price lists," "" "explains Malwarebytes-chief Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This means the damage of damage depending on type of data is even higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">Also, the perpetrators could take completely new goals on the Internet of things in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the hackerconference Defcon demonstrated safety researchers as they could get connected to the thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the ischeming of a derart blocked heating so many of the victims is quite a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block a whole factory road in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a subject in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and all-day dusting</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe and also the versatility of a minivans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, has actually proved extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, passengers have lots of space in the first row and in the fond of space, it works at no place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well processed and pleasant, only the cockpit-top falls into something.</seg>
<seg id="7">More versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR-V on the storage space.</seg>
<seg id="8">Not only a luggage compartment of 453 l is available for high-weight and 1026 l, but there is the "Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear can be folded like Kinosessel and offer the storage space that is 1.24 m high on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk can be loaded well, however, the charging height at 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The 1.6-liter diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V thanks to torque value of up to 300 Nm.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is likely to make his work a little bit quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The everyday consumption of 4,7 l / 100 km is gratifying.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine: a 1.5-liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The handling is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>

<seg id="19">To the safety systems the city emergency assistent (works up to speed 32), the collision alarm system and the Spurhalogen assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision swarts sometimes irritated because he assessed many obstacles as "descending object."</seg>
<seg id="21">Very reliable works of the district lighting assistant.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed controller responds to traffic detection and drosselt at demand.</seg>
<seg id="23">The full connectivity, however, are only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touch screen, Navi, App-integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and an HDMI jack are under the armrest and are therefore something handy to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The top 29,000 Euros for the well-equipped top diesel is fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">If you don't want to invest so much, the petrol will receive from 20000 euros, the diesel over 23,000 Euros.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening you can walk eternally, at night you wake up, in the morning it is far ahead of the wake-up ring not to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is all other than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one has problems with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adult sleep problems and over ten percent found their sleep frequently or permanent than not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How does sleep problems or sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and there are various causes of underlying, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeks, board member of the German Society for Schlaffing and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you understand, however, is the Insomnia, thus a single and downsleeping disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">As a result, many people feel unsatisfactory or insufficient, Jens Wagenknecht, board member, says member of the German Domestic Research association with practice in the Saxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disturbances are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Organic, psychological or behavioral factors, but also medications are stuck behind.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the sleep disorder expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is common especially for depression," "" "says Weeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors need each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who, for example, has a band disc, can be poorly lying, wakes every two to three hours and begins to ponder about everyday problems and drink, there is one example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I be with sleep disturbances to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a month of at least three nights a week should not sleep well and the day is impaired, she should go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: it is routed, tired, undated, has difficulty with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To ease the sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a treatment options, behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy, or even medicines - classical sleep tablets just for emergency and maximum for two weeks - inquire.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, there are hardly anyone living in Germany, emphasises Prof. Ingo Fiber, Head of the Interdisciplinary Research Centre at the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore you should contact with sleep problems initially at the housener, advises Weeks.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can clarify with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who was going to sleep in sleep, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the study in the sleeping corner physician, for example, in snoring with respiratory irritability, in sleep problems or if you do not find the cause of a sleepy disorder, Fifa explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">You do not have to prepare for the study.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not have lunch," says Fifa.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the wideaway one gets to his normal time in bed.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, one is wearing a nose of nose, chest strap and a antennae on his finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">Additionally, a camera shows the sleeping corner to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can these problems get the handle in handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of screws, where you can sit for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Woe is counting on: regular sleeping and ristides, not to sleep long in bed, not watching television to sleep, alcohol meight and at night not at the clock - then you start to count immediately, and that's quite and certainly not promoting.</seg>

<seg id="1">Altbuilds, a few lintels, in between still the rest of the head of the head: the Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain looks at first sight, but the police counts them to the "dangerous locations" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you travel along the road from east to west, you come to play places, a refreshed nursery and a biolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">Someone at the facade of a gray house someone has "ugly!"</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite a Lidl which will soon be demolished, it is already built: until 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new tenants will emerge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article about this "trendy district," as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, however, are illustrated with burning cars in recent weeks.</seg>
<seg id="6">Reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have lease agreements, but on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, at the beginning of the year, the police had repeatedly called for a tough action against the project, the area as "no-Go-zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous authority.</seg>
<seg id="8">After on 22 June the rooms were cleared out on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, the police stopped three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officers and three club cars on site, locked parts of the street and kept visitors off to enter the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, renovated construction workers were commissioned by the unknown house owner.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin administration court ruled that the evacuation was illegal, and one day later, police and builders moved under the jubilation of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon, the road seems peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others entertained himself vorous late.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the building projects there are primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the chief of many people: Kerstin Neugebauer lives in the "Kiez" since 1999, and Jana *, who has played three children here, are generated mainly by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the building projects, they share the care of increasing miets and rification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound after a Kiez, who wanted to create multiple police protection from vanding on the left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trenches which the Berlin Innensenator and the police open between house relations and their neighbours, obviously doesn't exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East Berlin was actually a traditional workforce, which is also a lower level of poverty in comparison to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">House-owned and the newborns home projects are already a long walk to the "Kiez:" in 1990, numerous houses were occupied by the former GDR, including nearly the whole Mainzer road close to the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was under large police officers in a real street battle, many of the projects were legalised in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by people today, which they occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the borough of the world became increasingly becoming the magnets for tourists and eleconliners from all over the world: with them the natives of GDR-times and former house-heretics are sharing their Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is also noticeable in the rents that have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: one can recognize them in designed slices or freshly painted facades, which were cast with color bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned this year as often with the words "left autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">A reason that not all neighbours can see that as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes as body injury, according to statistics, according to statistics, is almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the crimes make nondamage, the tendencially rather the newly built and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">Kerstin Neugebauer lives for Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in a lehouse since 17 years, can not be heard by uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is crucial: people in the 94 are their neighbours who have not been meant for this.</seg>
<seg id="28">The famous burning cars also give it straight in the Rigaer to no longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the study of architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here one helps each other, together live together on the street and gets more of each other than somewhere else."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is consciously drawn into the Rigaer Straße - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is why it was so important that the locals call their streets: from the police, politics and the media, which suddenly occupied all the Deutshear to the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: by compromising new buildings in former construction gaps that push the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"indeed, the condominium, which are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well booked," she says.</seg>
<seg id="34">"violence and destruction I can absolutely no guidey."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should I do if a man does not listen to anyone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For allotees who teats over color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the building projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who attracts, should be aware of it - just like anyone who moves into a pub district, which can complain badly about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All people only provided with the names presented, did not be called to be called by their real name.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new Refugee Commissioner</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in the integration and organiser.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition, she is a social worker.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been refugee officers for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogy supports the team of administration to Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It sees itself as the contact partner for all actors: refugees, working group refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else is missing.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer of the working group indicates that the volunteer is more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, the vast wool of wool, which has primarily a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less ridiculating than rather on the multitude of desire responsibilities - meant, meant that the management wanted to leave the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">A administration with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-term experience in the field of social work, a jealous wool of wool.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, administrative work is not its central area, Annika Deuschle writes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Especially, it is an organization, working with people on the spot, and behind the scenes as well as network quality.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been with us for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent spot on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was the highest time," "" "says Regine Customer, that Annika Deuschle honors and main actors supported." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small issues, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are coming in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been to be found since some time, apartments for connecting flights which have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for connecting the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must undertake the refugees in their own or hired living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of building, rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the councillor to the municipality and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer its apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed as very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private homes.</seg>
<seg id="25">It does not work so far, so you need to depend on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common apartments must be remembered as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are installed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only apartments are not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed lead, there are internships, training courses, school places, one-euro jobs and useful activities for refugees and migrants who have to be folded or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reported Regine client.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help housings, do not do-for-profit work - and that motivated and very tidy, such as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes the work for the community is to result in a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "that is" "" "no employment therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "but he does not only mean work." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a fixed structure, say Deuschle and Customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a humiliating feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">So we need offers as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here the administration and Voluntary Voluntary can jump.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling, they are welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They must explain the refugees that it takes, and they can make the time useful, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Who would like to develop the feeling that he could not work anyone in Urbach, do not work and be unprofitable, he will never be able to integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">There are also problem cases, but customer is honest, "people, in which nothing goes wrong." the work of Deuschle and Customer may therefore always be motivated to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "it is already a" "" "mammoth task." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two after the recent accusations are afraid of radicalization, even in a small church like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "no," "" "says Regine customer very clearly," "" "what mancher naive may call." "" "a residency could and if not to exclude it." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These events are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassin would carry them completely in obituary.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So basic - and volunteer-site must look for activities and in the region to activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">So they always have in the background that a new thrust in refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, the policies shy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to place her helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "in Urbach we have not arrived there, where we would like to" "" "Annika Deuschle says." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher was fully utilized to incorporate the previous people.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 persons, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no easy answers.</seg>
