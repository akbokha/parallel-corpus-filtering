Obama received Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as about Teheran to dest@@ abil@@ ising measures in the Middle East .
it is said to have the conflict with the Palestinians , and they discussed two @-@ state solution .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been curious for years .
Washington critici@@ zes the pro@@ vocation of Israel &apos;s ongoing sett@@ ling in Israel and continues to appeal to the peace process .
through the deal of Obama , the Iranian nuclear programme has deterior@@ ated further .
in March , Netanyahu declared a controversial speech at the invitation of the US Congress which was filled as an aff@@ ron@@ ed to Obama .
the speech was not ab@@ orted by Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to the elections in Israel .
in an ob@@ itu@@ ary professor , to have shot his girlfriend
in a call , Professor Sh@@ annon donated with a somewhat c@@ itt@@ led voice of the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; cute dog &quot; but still live and probably ex@@ ited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
within the house the officials found the bodies of Amy P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s and a handwritten note that I wanted to go on a white block , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . that was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed from Lamb .
there was no indication of this , that he traveled in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , where he travelled for 300 miles to the school grounds , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office and killed and killed .
Delta State University of the police police Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that his k@@ art employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 PM .
he said , Lamb has made the cat@@ astrop@@ hic event then sometime afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life when the police viol@@ ated him .
one day after shooting at the university , the students and lecturer , forced to hide themselves behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to raise a picture of what Lamb is motivated .
the details offered by investig@@ ators at both ends of the state details , including what students and employees who knew him , helped him to draw a picture of a talented , but perhaps difficult teacher .
students said they were rejo@@ iced at his teaching .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s died , said he did not have history of violence or criminal history .
he mentioned himself in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both are sub@@ ordin@@ ated in the department of social sciences and history , encomp@@ assing 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time , there were some in@@ clin@@ ations related to proble@@ matic behavi@@ ours .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ avers , the Lamb praised , said he was also a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
this had previously asked the Delta State University for a claim of health reasons and said that he had any problem with any health problem .
this year , he only taught two online courses .
according to the recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy , that the promotion has worked so hard for which lamb had worked so hard for which , no warranty for an automatic way would be displayed as Assistant Professor .
University of William La@@ For@@ ge said he knows nothing from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot;
these are questions , which cannot answer any more .
after the flight from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs track , as he returned to Mississippi from Arkan@@ sas .
before being arrested , he killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre gun in the back@@ yard of a house about one mile south of his parents &quot; home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car still ran in the entrance .
it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said they knew he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb opened his work at the University of 2009 , which attracted 3.500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants , and taught geography and education .
he graduated in ped@@ agog@@ y , too .
one of the long @-@ lived girl@@ friends described him as a intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la hair@@ y said she was 15 and he was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
they and their friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her guitar playing .
he was the s@@ warm of women at that time .
all girls are melted away when he was there , &quot; hair@@ y said , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ ban of Bran@@ don .
lamb and P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s were obviously some time together .
in the emergency call , &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage .
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house that drove to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s , Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said that they were 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met this , but with his daughter , Abig@@ ail , he heard that he was interested in music and playing blues .
Lamb met P@@ ren@@ eg@@ s when he and Abig@@ ail came to Abig@@ ail three years ago , both in a summer @-@ fair .
later they played together one or other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s was a nurse , who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he has ended from Lamb and P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s Night in the night of September 5 , after signing his guitar and harmon@@ ica example ended before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no signs that something was not right .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were on the clean and jo@@ king together .
I mean , they both had a good sense of joke .
Schmidt , the dead professor , conducted the First @-@ term seminar program and speci@@ alis@@ es in American citizens and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , a English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas , and was President of his Brotherhood and the student Committee .
on Tuesday night about 900 people attended the Delta State University in Cleveland , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the municipality at a candle light ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ wife &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the Memorial , while the Univers@@ it@@ ch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Morning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ geli@@ o So@@ lis reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associ@@ ated Press author Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to contra@@ dic@@ ate that the police now says he had shot Schmidt , and that lamb had been called P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever been married .

8 Respon@@ si@@ bilities , showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to stamp him as a flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are trying to move Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper increases in surveys from below , it doesn &apos;t work .
ten of the last eleven national surveys show Donald Tr@@ ump in a double @-@ digit range , and some start to serious about what it meant for the opportunities of nom@@ ination of the real estate @-@ Mog@@ l .
of course it is too early in the election period .
no claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphas@@ ise that this time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys guided tour to the rising Herman Cain , of which no one gained a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but external side groups like J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super P@@ AC , and the conservative Economic Group Club for Growth now recognise dr@@ um@@ ps and start to flow down their dollars to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current transi@@ tions , pointing to the fact that the real estate fashion Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary stage :
tr@@ um@@ ps popularity characteristics have turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey by the Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate mar@@ gu@@ l .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
in early August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view from Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures hold in early States .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has found last week that 60 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P voters , GO@@ P would be happy with b@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey of CNN / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans were , they would either be &quot; enthusiastic , &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
only two of 10 say they were &quot; anno@@ ys &quot; when he was the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son manages roughly the same enthusiasm as tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; enth@@ r@@ alled &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about the ump of ump ) .
the next thing in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio is only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republican voters say that they were &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; when J@@ eb Bush , the Favor@@ it of the Est@@ abl@@ ation , would become a candidate .
a majority of rep@@ ublic@@ ans can not see Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 per cent of voters think that the real estate fashion Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is considered in the first preliminary state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans believe that he has the personality of a Commander in Chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively execute his position , and nearly six out of 10 independent people say that his tem@@ per does not reach the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republican voters get used to the idea .
if they set their money beware , Republican voters think Tr@@ ump is real .
if they are asked who the most likely the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a CNN / OR@@ C survey from the past week , four out of ten claimed that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
that has been a change since that time , when four of them put money to J@@ eb Bush from ten late July .
full Dis@@ closure : GO@@ P voters had not the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at that time in the last cycle there were four of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination would win only 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P voters see Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign as ch@@ att@@ ing .
even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans collect any other candidates , Tr@@ ump finds even almost every one .
some experts suggest that the dis@@ fra@@ il field is likely to be joined to Tr@@ um@@ ps , whereas the anti @-@ slip @-@ support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates diff@@ use .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most other republi@@ can candidates , tr@@ ump the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally from the edge of Paul , John Ka@@ er and Chris Christie 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who hits him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneurs with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a succ@@ inct majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ fans says they have formed their mind .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday reveals that only a little more than half of voters supporting the ump , say that they have fixed their voices .
of course , much has happened to change that , and no one can really say to change the opinion .
46 percent said they open the door open to switch to other candidates .
yet , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but elec@@ tors who say they have their opinions twice as often for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they match the van@@ ump on immigration .
ever since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign about two months ago immigrants from Mexico &quot; rape &quot; was the immigration and fishing spot in the public dis@@ course of 2016 .
some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump is crucial His@@ p@@ ano Americans keep away from the Republican party and will damage the orient@@ ated efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that it coinci@@ des with Tr@@ ump on issues of immigration .
so long as the immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump appears to do too .
the fru@@ strations for the government is climbing new high@@ s .
by Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , roughly half of the assistance of Republican voters , especially by their out@@ si@@ ders .
six of the 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey by ABC / Post , they prefer a foreign policy approach as someone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Registry / Bloomberg in I@@ owa - two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa rep@@ ublic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Congress , with 54 percent &quot; in@@ dis@@ satisfied , &quot; and 21 per cent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential districts of Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg is the most expensive residential community with views of the North Sea F@@ att .
the road will cost an area of € 7@@ 3,@@ 300 in the street .
&quot; based on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects naturally is limited , &quot; says in the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows , in which particular layers are a square meters most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student residence in Munich are not really little .
unlike Germany &apos;s top units , one of the price does not occur like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider angels &amp; V@@ ölk@@ l has published a ranking of the most exclusive German resi@@ den@@ ces - with square footage in dizz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of men - per square meter , un@@ noticed .

Champions League : Bayern @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two times Tor@@ r@@ ins in Pi@@ raeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller is just a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller and FC Bayern owned the way to a well @-@ earned 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then ran .
a convincing kick @-@ off of the Champions League @-@ season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze won the FC Bayern of the district of Pi@@ raeus as a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off game in the Champions League at the Greek record master Olympi@@ ac@@ os in warm atmosphere thanks to Mü@@ llers double pack ( 52 . ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th start @-@ success in series should be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich .
Müller was awarded in his 28 hits at the Champions League to the Bavarian @-@ Gui@@ ded Mi@@ th@@ aid from the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who allowed him to pass a f@@ light@@ less shot of the world champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bavaria @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ame before the game at Kar@@ a@@ is@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 for hot fans - and the Munich kept word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance without to shine .
Pi@@ raeus had won his youngest six home games in the Royal class , including renowned clubs as Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund was stum@@ bled ( 1 : 3 ) .
however , in seven Europe @-@ up du@@ els with Greek Teams , Bavaria did not want to be the next sacrifice .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but often in their vigor@@ ous efforts , too , to inv@@ ent themselves .
the attacks were often led by le@@ aning on Lin@@ ks@@ im Douglas Costa , who was seldom passed against the former Braunschwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more happiness from the right than its flan@@ k from the right hemisphere at the left upper toe .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion was the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ stri@@ ker Ide@@ ye Brown suggested the Poland &apos;s head ball ( 26 ) .
then by direct arrival , the keeper were par@@ ted with the knees ( 3@@ 5th ) .
although the Bayern tra@@ pped her usual game , Pi@@ raeus could set their no@@ bility .
but Manuel launches Prime Minister .
on the way he gave a shot from Ide@@ ye about the Lat@@ te l@@ enk@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
first New Zealand , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola left a qu@@ ette with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng that made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , sat out first .
the World Cup @-@ hero had given the green light only after finishing the green light , said : &quot; Sky by Matthias Sam@@ mer said : &quot; whoever wants to make something different from it , is already become malign@@ ant . &quot;
also during the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the proposed Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and 13 minutes later everything was clear by El@@ f@@ ax@@ as before Müller before .
before the game , it was all to be rest@@ art@@ ed in the stadium .
after a minor group of re@@ frac@@ ted Bayern fans in their audience block apparently , the supporters of the hosts , Pir@@ ates with words and gest@@ ures , attacked the security forces and went with impact sho@@ cks against the Munich trailer .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan have been transported from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also teeth - that suggests a long @-@ term study of Potsdam .
the good news : when zi@@ cht does the risk sin@@ ks quickly .
smokers have a much higher risk of losing their teeth early .
this is the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non smoking smokers , smoking lay the risk of losing their teeth at the time of the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 feet higher .
scientists had observed over 23.@@ 300 participants .
main causes for dental out@@ ages affect cavi@@ ties and inflamm@@ ations of the gum , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the connection between smoking and dental loss , therefore , go back on frequent fl@@ esh@@ g@@ ums in smokers .
do not be clari@@ fied , however , if smoking increases the risk of dental c@@ aries .
people who stopped smoking can reduce their risk but in a short time , the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the threat to the level of non @-@ smokers , declared the first @-@ point Thomas Dietrich from the English University Birmingham .
one should convince people to become non @-@ smokers , &quot; says study manager H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shortened the lifetime . &quot;
not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and leads to our findings also to a good dental health until high age .
over 20 percent of the population at the age of 65 @-@ 74 years of el@@ essness has been affected by DI@@ f@@ E .
earlier studies have already noted that smoking increases the risk of early co@@ aches .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ lie the findings .

EU Commission proposes in dispute over TT@@ IP new court
the EU Commission proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system on the proposed trans@@ atlan@@ tic trade agreement TT@@ IP , which has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
as a result , the controversial private lighting equipment for disp@@ utes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a transparent enter@@ al system which corresponds to significantly more traditional dishes in its functionality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust the citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the EU @-@ Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström initi@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ de decided to bring the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade calls with the United States .
the German government announced support .
the world &apos;s largest free trade zone in the world will develop 800 million people .
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proce@@ eding approaches that the EU states and the US choose independent judges for a new investment plan .
they should come from the EU , the USA , and third countries .
the second instance is provided for the first time .
she would allow it to rise against jud@@ ging .
the most involved parties agreed on the refer@@ ee , a possibility of contra@@ diction against their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past months , it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice , commented on Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , they want to work on an International Investment Appe@@ als .
there , for example , a disp@@ utes between Chinese companies and EU states may be clari@@ fied .
the Investor Support Proc@@ edure ( IS@@ DS ) are regarded as one of the main reasons for major resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are being critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary on the organization of the tax pay@@ ers , which allow national laws or break a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
in first statements , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organisations such as Camp@@ act inadequate the proposals of the EU Commission as in@@ sufficient .
it has been critici@@ zed for free trade agreements with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) for this purpose .
the German economist Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) described the plans for a great deal of progress .
the Commission did not take into consideration the fundamental points for the reform , the Federal Minister of Social Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , in spring , with other EU @-@ trade ministers .
the old system of private refer@@ ees was from the table .
the French government welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European Business Association Business@@ Europe warned against limit the activities of the economy through too many new rules .

when the talks on the free trade agreement TT@@ IP ( Tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remained un@@ clear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the United States .
originally a framework for this agreement should already be at the end of this year .

Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ ns debut in the prime minister &apos;s questionnaire
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut has been eag@@ erly anticipated by the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ prime minister since his election .
the new Labour leader Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n is alleged to give him his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questionnaire and David Cameron in the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will find out to exp@@ ose the first of his six @-@ given questions shortly after lunch , with his performance from the media probably and the Labour MPs from the neighbourhood .
he invited &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also told that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave them colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary assessment for Mr Cor@@ b@@ ula leadership , because it comes after his appointment to a member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ in@@ qu@@ an and his speech at the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the decision of the Labour leader was prov@@ oked on Tuesday during the celebration of the National An@@ them during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , cri@@ tique of a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS and stands at the heart of several cover stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision to sing not the national an@@ them , has attention to itself
a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence &quot; and he recognized the &quot; Hel@@ dent@@ um of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told the BBC &apos; Two News@@ night Program , told the Labour leader to sing the National An@@ them , independent from his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they were calling on differences in business , defense and foreign policy , while fewer than one sixth of the EU Joint Parliamentary Party were initially supported as leader .
the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences may also be st@@ acked within Labour &quot; and according to Mr Cor@@ y@@ ns &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the constra@@ int on profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes propose to remove all the idea of a limitation .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of working and pensions minister , said that the party is &quot; very clear , &quot; that they only would be opposed to government &apos;s plans to reduce the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , ever since he has T@@ ory leader , over the last decade across the dis@@ patch box in parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader who has promised another political attitude that he has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Is@@ lington North MP said that the prime minister of the Prime Minister is confron@@ t@@ ational and that he will under@@ take both &quot; striking diversity &quot; and the stre@@ ch@@ ings with resist@@ or , has decided to concentrate on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the Syrian economic Minister , is represented since he does not take part - for example , when Mr Cameron is abroad .
he also brought the idea to the word that other colleagues take the word occasionally , and that he had addressed John Ber@@ s@@ cow , the speaker of the house , to discuss the problem .
when he was a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said he wanted to &quot; remove himself from politics in a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theater , &quot; which often is linked to the prime minister of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he admitted that he had failed .
since she was sent out on television first in 1990 , the Fra@@ gment was made by Prime Minister as a chief bar@@ ometer of a ruler and his command in the under@@ house and his position under his par@@ liament@@ arians , though critics argued that it has become a caric@@ ature and require a far reaching reforms .

pounds increases by increased wage growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; &quot; &quot; the pound went straight after data , showing a rise in the UK &apos;s wage growth . in parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was enhanced by the goal goal SA@@ BM@@ iller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew up to 2.9 % compared to the same period of the same period .
this percentage was the fastest and earned ass@@ essments on the time of interest auction .
the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar on $ 1.@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the Euro 1,@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index ended with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the best share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the purchase of the ri@@ vals of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .

Bur@@ berry shares were driven by the competi@@ ting news from the competition group for luxury goods Ri@@ chem@@ y 0,9 % .
demand at the latest sales figures suggest all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - will be donated again .
shares of G@@ LE@@ N@@ CO@@ RE increased by 5 % after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion $ by a stock sales as part of its strategy of debt reduction .

the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages would end@@ anger the expansion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill said that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would mean more buying power in po@@ ckets of potential customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is unlikely that this buying power will be equal to higher labour costs at his company , he says .
the costs could meet the plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

Pe@@ ida poster produces a Lebanese idea for a potato @-@ ton@@ er @-@ idea
potatoes or cab@@ s ?
it is both - and in the potato h@@ ic@@ er , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger i@@ mb@@ iss@@ ant , Han@@ i Al@@ hay , has developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the phrase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea brought him a poster on a p@@ amp@@ on demonstration with the inscription &quot; potatoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had seen on television .
since then he has a bar@@ bec@@ u@@ able barbecue , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ ticul@@ tur@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
Lebanese man has meanwhile been able to enter in law at the Patent Office in Munich .
there , according to the authority , it has been protected as utility models since .
how much meat and how much potatoes of the sk@@ ewers also contains , Al@@ hay doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y it .
only as much : &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; he finds .

Met@@ cash starts action on the fight against aging from aging
Met@@ cash tries to protect the IG@@ A branches off a Al@@ di walk in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has started a ground fighting campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia in the run of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di has opened the opening of two distribution centers in South Australia and Western Australia from the beginning of next year , the Met@@ cash and IG@@ A @-@ supermarkets are preparing their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand IG@@ A through mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing concerning social media , as well as events such as Adelaide @-@ show .
IG@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , who distri@@ butes samples in IG@@ A @-@ shops and shop@@ keeper , who distri@@ butes tickets to the South Australian soccer league in loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash has further published more details of his defense strategy on 29 September when the wholes@@ aler gets through its annual investors for food , alcohol and devices .
it is a lot on the game that South Australia and Western Australia comprise nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A shop@@ fitting business and generate higher profit mar@@ gins as a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the eastern states .
shop@@ per in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and IG@@ A retail@@ er have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in eastern Australia .
however , analysts like Morgan Stanley believes that Al@@ di will s@@ nat@@ ch about five percent of the food market in these two states after opening its first markets , and will take away all existing actors , but primarily independent retailers .
according to a report published in this week , the Analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath discovered by Morgan Stanley , that IG@@ A @-@ retail@@ er will lose 360 $ million sales per year and will lose $ 250 million in cash by the end of 2016 .
it is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will be opened at 25 stores in SA and 30 in the next year and will generate revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food@@ stuffs and grocery store and in the amounts of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost @-@ based Met@@ cash could cost roughly 13 million $ gain before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in the eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IG@@ A buyers are the faithful ones .
Morgan Stanley is participating that met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in food and grocery by 3.8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 , and 2.1 percent in 2018 , will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear .
Met@@ cash refused to respond to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has been in contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ As market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which has fallen about 1,200 percent since 2012 , which reflects the operational debt reduction in indirect pressure on sales and mar@@ gins .
however , the wholes@@ aler prev@@ ails and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to res@@ ell sales prices with hundreds of products every week and IG@@ A single @-@ retailers in improving their stores through faster growing fresh foods and to deliver better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Main Business@@ man Ian Mor@@ rice says that price custom@@ iz@@ ations and shop san@@ itation programs will be exported and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit margin for the first time in four years in 2017 .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of the Australian tennis country Steve He@@ aly
than@@ asi co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise than criticism for his behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Than@@ asi co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ater@@ als &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ z and ear@@ ns to view the President of the Australian tennis alliance Steve He@@ aly rather praise to criticism for his own behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who is again referred to as the Special KS once again , was found by the not@@ orious experiments of Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA in Montreal and the spotlight .
in a fier@@ y qualifying game in Cincinnati soon afterwards co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison will have to be separated twice through the refer@@ ee . &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA has obtained Kyr@@ gios , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen , as he struck a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp was fighting a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ending by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in singles qualifying on Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ finals against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which I am quite jeal@@ ous is the fact that after my opinion , Than@@ asi was a little in the argument , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost because of a var@@ ic@@ ose in the US Open , but it is not the first player who has broken out a fru@@ stration with themselves and I know Than@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of them .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved himself in the US Open , extremely well , even among the quite @-@ pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances of Harrison and so forth , and I think he deserves recognition .
he &apos;s a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was a bit too hard .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he has never been a problem with the other players , he is involved in the changing sector , he is a very stable and sophisticated young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own services .
He@@ aly said also the decision to take the Kyr@@ gy@@ n at the important decision decision , which begins on Friday and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right for all , but he protects the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term lasting part into the team . &quot;
&quot; first of all , we wish that the team is completely focused on competition and not all around the controversy sur@@ ren@@ ly &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I think Nick has made a rapid rise to what people like Feder@@ er and Murray are pointed out . he asc@@ ends to the eye , but we are trying to make him understand@@ able , but we try to think him the consequences of his action . in which he can only think about it , I hold for it and it is best for the team , and it is best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains Not@@ with@@ standing , conclu@@ des the border , holds refugees back
Hungary de@@ ple@@ dged the national border with Serbia on Tuesday and kept everyone who tried to come illeg@@ ally into the country . everything with the aim to stop the current of migrants .
chaos followed the border , when hundreds of migrants were re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Serbian officials re@@ acted with indig@@ nation .
the people who fled before violence were st@@ aked for a UFO in a strip on the street between the two control points of the countries and built tents , and settled there .
but fru@@ strations climbed up .
as a police helicopter floating above them , the migrants &apos; open the border ! &quot; and they cried out ins@@ ults against the Hungarian re@@ pris@@ als .
some pointed back from protest to food@@ stuffs and water .
Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said it was &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants coming from Hungary would be sent back during more and more from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral harm .
it must take place in the coming days , with Brussels and other countries , &quot; Iv@@ ica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague .
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serb border came a day after the 28 @-@ nations @-@ block at a str@@ ingent meeting in Brussels not to agree any common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who , in the past month or by the end of the year , would have achieved an agreement that the EU states would receive more than 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary as well .
on Tuesday , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit in the European Union to discuss the immigration policy of the continent .
Hungary , however , did not establish its hopes for an early action by Brussels or its neighbors .
the emergency was issued on Tuesday in two southern regions , authorities issued more powers to overcome the crisis , so they could accelerate streets and asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country also finishes the construction of a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania in order to stop the state of migrants through the country , after the end of a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison workers were deployed at the race to create bar@@ bed wire @-@ fence between Hungary and Serbia .
during the past months , Hungary has become a considerable bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees and elsewhere in the Middle East into the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , insi@@ sted that most of the arriving economic refugees are seeking for a better life , and not war refugees , which are entitled to protection - a view that strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws which came into force in Hungary in order to cross the border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 ft ) high z@@ a@@ uns in order to build the government along the southern border with Serbia . these laws apply even higher fin@@ s for condemned human traff@@ ick@@ ers .
&quot; because of the situation , which emerged from mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency , &quot; said Government representative Z@@ olt@@ an Kov@@ acs Rep@@ or@@ ers in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
Parliament must not agree to the use of the military , which is expected for the next week , but rep@@ orters by Associ@@ ated Press have seen on the border of difficult armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , State Security Ad@@ vis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others were already pushing deeper into the country .
they come across , sh@@ elling the fence , they are now in custody , and they are accused of off@@ ences after the new laws .
authorities are involved to rep@@ airing the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a train @-@ car with bar@@ bed wire to close the boundaries .
chaos surro@@ unds the most important Gren@@ zen@@ ge near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and pressed people in order to imp@@ ose a crowd .
about 20 people managed to get involved , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants who blocked the national highway between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would spend food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead to Ber@@ nie S@@ anders into a national pol@@ l
the former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit start in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders won against her against ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic elec@@ torate in the preliminary elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while others stands second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den who has not yet announced whether he is serving the Presi@@ dency , receives support of 15 per cent of the democra@@ cies of the elections .
more than five months before the start of the preliminary elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is fixed , which candidate will support them .
but Clin@@ ton supporters are more constant in their election than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton had lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups while winning a number of profits .
Clinton held a wide margin in women and wives , but these origins have been reduced .
your support in men is decl@@ ining significantly , and S@@ anders is only with 5 points .
Clin@@ ton Major in democratic voters under 50 years has failed , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
but Clinton had a huge advantage over the older voters .
last month , Clinton came ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit head over the Liber@@ als , but now S@@ anders has a 5 @-@ point lead over this group .
about half of the EU &apos;s democra@@ cies say that they would help themselves with enthusiasm , if they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some predi@@ ctions and a further 15 percent would only support them because it is the can@@ di@@ ate .
six percent would not support them .
maybe it is not surprising that Clin@@ ton present current supporters are enthusiastic about her .
the views are stronger , with those who currently not support Clinton - only about one quarter would support it enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of the democra@@ cies say that they help Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republican voters say this over their leading candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clinton &apos;s supporters in an open question , why they want it to be the can@@ di@@ ate , the most frequent answer is that it is the correct answer ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that a woman president is President ( 13 percent ) and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) is also mentioned by Clin@@ ton supporters .
consent to dealing with the problems and the eligi@@ bility are also cited .
as the vice @-@ president acc@@ uses the potential for the presidency in the scales , 57 percent of the elections of the elections saw him in the race - although a third believed that he should not do it .
if Democratic voters are asked for the elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
more than half of Clin@@ ton &apos;s followers say that Bi@@ den would be a second choice far ahead of his .
if he decides to can@@ di@@ de on the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead to S@@ anders , of 20 points with bi@@ den in the race at 30 points without him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of democratic voters do see Clinton as can@@ di@@ ate with the best chances to win ; however , this number dropped by 78 percent last month .
bi@@ den is by spac@@ ing a second at this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; selectable &quot; value has increased .
nevertheless , regarding the question , which is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call a question of voters .
similarly as last month , no single democracy candidate or a potential candidate for these voters is un@@ acceptable .
the candidates or potential candidates take good results in some important tra@@ its in voters of their party &apos;s sel@@ ections .
maj@@ orities see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trusted and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
he cuts the three candidates best for hon@@ esty while Clin@@ ton &apos;s strength is in the lead .
thirty per cent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trusted , twice as many as they say about different ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent did not think of it .
Democratic voters of the elections in general also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in agreement with their views .
at all of these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
in case of Hillary Clinton &apos;s personal e @-@ mail address and an server to be continued during the term as an foreign minister , most of the Democratic voters are pleased with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions has not affected them altogether .
but it is a different story in the American public .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about a third is satisfied .
the public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most of the Americans say that the e @-@ mail controversy did not have effects on their general opinions from Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion was still wor@@ sen@@ ed by her .
they are mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say their views of Clinton became worse .
although Clinton &apos;s voters think of their party to be honest and trusted , this is still a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trusted , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 % of voting claims they do not hold for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 percent of voting rights are also regarded as non @-@ f@@ rank and non @-@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , get good grades with leadership .
out of the six candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut off best for hon@@ esty .
a majority looks different rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son there are no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the preliminary elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son is moving closer to Donald Tr@@ ump in a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is located in the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times close behind Donald Tr@@ ump
in the meantime , half of the candidates he@@ ats up half of voters in the new survey , and others lose very dramatically .
Republican voters nationwide continue to support tear in large numbers . 23 % of the last C@@ BS survey , which was conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , is 27 % in the survey conducted by Tuesday .
but Car@@ son enjoyed the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well connected during demo@@ graphic groups and p@@ umping over Republican voters to university education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Governor John Ka@@ ze , is defeated by Wis@@ con@@ sins , Governor Scott Walker , who died at the lowest price of 10 % in the last month .
former Governor , J@@ eb Bush , former Governor of Arkan@@ sas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio take up 6 % in third place .
the error mar@@ ge in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republican voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son is going into the p@@ olls - it works with 19 % support for the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the b@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed pl@@ ump clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
at a glance at one in the last week , Tr@@ ump found out some side@@ hi@@ ves for the former neurolog@@ y , even after Car@@ son did not owe to question Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s belief in question .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a campaign appearance in I@@ owa .

five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College nov@@ ings
nearly two years after a student during a schi@@ z@@ ous ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ ord@@ an@@ ese are filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ bro@@ therhood called Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory over in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to the hospital , which has contributed to his death , the police shared with .
officials said he was loaded with cl@@ as@@ ped eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked , while he tried to access a frozen field on a frozen field .
Mr. Den@@ g compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood call not calling the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ full and waited for an hour before they brought him into a hospital like the police .
however , they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ s clothing , his symptoms to goo@@ geln and Andy Men@@ g to contact the national president of the Brotherhood , to bring her advice , said Poli@@ tic@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members of the Muslim organizations began to hide and asked the welfare of the Brotherhood about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ tic@@ ef Wagner .
he could not revi@@ ved , and he died at his injuries next morning .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added to bl@@ unt , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the har@@ ass@@ ment of the Brotherhood . at least one student has been dying every year since 1970 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , whose D@@ eng@@ s family represents , in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
brothers and members have to be held accoun@@ table , and this step of government is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe accepted an indictment due to murder of third @-@ war crimes for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with schi@@ p attacks and creating a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to do the involved people , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially - this sanc@@ tioned , so we will also go to account , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood can with@@ stand its affili@@ ation to the local community .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest
a rate of interest comes , and the house is going to be wan@@ ing , ren@@ ding for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into a recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last , and how long it will continue .
in particular , the story for the economy only offers low instructions to develop .
a recession occurred within just 11 months after the first interest rate and lasted 86 months .
the aggression of the Federal Reserve on raising of interest rates is often , if not always , a factor will react such as the economy and financial investments .
as a result , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank therefore strongly empha@@ sized that investors should not concentrate on how they start to increase interest rates , but rather on the period which is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants could realise that all the excitement about an interest rate hike was probably exagger@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is likely to be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Julian J@@ ess@@ op , economist at Capital Economics , said in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest to normal heights , but still on too low level , to lead to the se@@ is@@ mic shock , which seem to be feared .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no implic@@ ations .
here is a view of historical trends , based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market seen in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate hike can be volatile things for a while .
once the increase has arrived , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; it seems to be a tendency to de@@ generate assets 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which is reflected in monetary policy again , &quot; said German bank analysts in a recent study on what happens according to the interest rate hike of the F@@ ed .
more precisely , the market is mostly in upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate hike , fairly flat in the 250 days after that ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal condition after 500 days , with an average return on the previous six months , by Bob D@@ oll , boss station strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , based on Bar@@ ron &apos;s asset management .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tend to occur later in times of issu@@ ance and return on return to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of life life , but interest rate increases are often encouraging .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confron@@ ted with some terms , which apparently doesn &apos;t exist before and they could accelerate the recession .
remark@@ ably remarkable is that the gross domestic product is in the proximity of its lowest point in an interest rate hike of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , 118 interest rate accounted for by 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only few that this will last and expect to expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these interest rate increases with such frag@@ ile economic back@@ drop might be ris@@ ky and dis@@ card the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this time is different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have taken the F@@ ed market for the whole year , and all the eyes were fixed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held this week , which ended on Thursday .
as many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe the FO@@ MC could be an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trade marks only a percentage of 25 percent .
&quot; in our study all times of times from 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing moment@@ um has taken place at GDP and in pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ists very quickly put after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; says the report .
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession in the observed phase was .
the current cycle is far the longest one has been waiting for the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and so far 74 months .
the solid income was also volatile , since the market adver@@ ti@@ ses a rate of interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares if it change its strategic circuit .
bonds seem to change the direction if the first increase in lowering the cycle .
at the end of the reporting cycle , the bond returns immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the str@@ ated by Charles Schw@@ ab believes that the rise in the rates of interest is that ren@@ ders between longer and shorter bonds can be closer together and lead to a fl@@ aming of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high interest bonds often produce better yields in such a climate although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still careful to anticip@@ ate higher yields , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come Analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab in a analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
interest@@ ingly , Jones means that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the inflation rate , there are some evidence that the market has adapted to the prosp@@ ect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at short @-@ term interest rates are increased , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , bor@@ rowing have expanded , and the volume of vol@@ atility has increased - all the features of the market when the F@@ ed has sharp@@ ened its strategy .
in the large and whole , companies that roll the larger part of their business activity in the US will benefit if interest rates are increasing and local products will be more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts will rise worse , as one in rising dollars will make their products more expensive on the global market , and as well as financing of their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stocks are incl@@ ined to react extremely positive for three months after an initial interest rate hike , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sachs analysts in a report for the customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded the average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low vol@@ atility for their shares exceeded their counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will become a big problem .
company with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most , said Gold@@ man .
consumers will also benefit consumers outside the amount of pure equity .
as@@ per could see gains through higher income , even if experts have in different opinion , how fast this will happen .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says member of parliament Andrew B@@ ingham
the Conserv@@ atives and Parliament critic@@ ised the transmitter because of its &quot; dis@@ sec@@ ution &quot;
he argued that he is an increasingly different from commercial rival .
he also referred to the BBC Music Awards , saying that she was just the Br@@ its .
Parliament &apos;s colleague Dam@@ ien Collins attacked the Voice of The Voice and said that this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &apos; conver@@ ts &apos; to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading member of parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter , prove that he does something that does not do the private broad@@ caster .
the Conserv@@ atives from Andrew B@@ ingham also told the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses that the publicly @-@ legal radio station ev@@ apor@@ ated , and increasingly no longer distinguished by its commercial competitors .
&quot; radio 3 seems - I use the word &quot; dig@@ get@@ ing &quot; - but it seems to turn back to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also referred to the BBC Music Awards , which started in the last of December .
the BBC Music Awards who started in the last year seem to be the Br@@ its just under another name .
so , if you &apos;re trying to do something else - these are two spont@@ aneously named examples where you only re@@ im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
the BBC @-@ general manager rejected his accus@@ ations and argue that BBC Radio 3 goes well ahead of its commercial competition when it comes to public music and education .
what I learn from Radio 3 I &apos;m going to learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music playing , which is truly un@@ matched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of radio 3 to find new music and to give new works on order , I also feel really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that tough@@ er had to be worked to engage the audience as it did in the past , because the British have less than classical music .
radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production , which , during the hearing at the Committee on Education , Culture , Media and Sport , led to fire , to tramp@@ le the commercial rival to the feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Collins attacked The Voice to - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was bought by the Dutch producers Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly distinctive ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 @-@ show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George was produced as a judge - &quot; at the special BBC @-@ way . &quot;
he added , he wishes to find that the company &quot; find a hit from our house in the house , &quot; if the next time a chat series is set .
however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order of additional ranks of The Voice in the Future or give money to the fee pay@@ er for other am@@ us@@ ement formats .
Internet sales rose in August at the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for this .
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , the lowest result was recorded since the records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has hin@@ dered the issues in November
for over a decade the virtual shopping m@@ oming , and many of the main shopping streets of Great Britain have turned into viol@@ ins .
yet experts say that there are now indications that the online turnover stagn@@ ate , after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the expenditure on August represents the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase from the previous year .
experts say there are indications that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for previous years and go back up to 2000 , then it has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G dealers in the Guardian .
he declared that online sales were reinforced three years ago , when purch@@ aser started to buy shopping with their cell phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that humans could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now , one comm@@ utes himself , and we may experience that growth is reduced .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America , is considered a reason for the sales revenues below .
experts believe that buyers will return to their purchases at this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year five times the average number of buyers to make their computers to make their mou@@ ths , and some dealers websites collapsed .
experts believe that Black Friday in which the buyer could be fought for bar@@ gains , buyers could stop to make purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium has found out of £ 5 spending more than £ 1 £ .
some products such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines are now carried out more than one @-@ third of shopping boxes now via web shops .
at the same time buy more than one quarter of the people clothing and shoes online instead of fashion chains in the inner city .
Muslims buried the kill@@ ings in the Mek@@ ka at crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family sanc@@ tioned in
the bodies of 29 dead will be carried by Muslims in the first bur@@ ial of Muslims in Mec@@ ca
Saudi Arabia det@@ ains the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin Laden group .
the Ministry of Health said that in addition , 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collapsed .
hundreds of Muslims were gathered as 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collapsed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mosque .
grape filled , largely dressed in white , the distance to p@@ ollen when the first of the dead came to the Al @-@ Mor@@ mon cemetery .
the funeral proc@@ ession passed on the Holy site , where only days before a building cra@@ cked through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the bed collapsed .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi King above the construction company of the family bin Laden thanks to the disaster that had left 3@@ 94 injured , a sanc@@ tion imposed .
the bodies of 29 beds , who were killed when a crane collapsed by the Big Central Bank of Mec@@ ca , were carried by the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was the father of four children who fell on his first pilgrimage , fell into the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was in the Great Mos@@ que with his parents before the start of the annual H@@ add@@ h .
Saudi @-@ officials have already announced that the add@@ res@@ h will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to go to the city .
today , King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden group , would not have known the arm of the crane when he was not used .
a Arabic version of de@@ vis@@ as , which was published by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency reported this detail not in English , but said that the company &apos;s leadership had prohibited from abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man failed to unv@@ eil what fell the fall of the crane , which fell into a courtyard of the big mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims go to the H@@ add@@ sch h@@ ash that was later held this month .
the Bin Laden Group never published any statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also imp@@ ose the group because of not current security measures , because she had not operated with meteor@@ ologist .
dozens of cranes in the Mec@@ ca large mo@@ on@@ ee as part of the massive building concept guided by the Bin Laden group .
the family of bin Laden has been connected by the royal family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over greater construction projects .
al @-@ Qaeda chief , Osama bin Laden , was a son of a tru@@ ste@@ er , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s years .
the crash of the crane came in the middle among strong winds and rain , a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is at least once in the life of every healthy fit .
officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital .
representatives agree that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were paid to the members of the killed and the same sum to permanently injured .
others get half this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen :
British increasingly employ handi@@ craftsmen , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified Cra@@ fts@@ men from Eastern Europe has stagn@@ ated behind
this will result in that 200 new Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are set up on cra@@ ft@@ men , will be opened
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q Shops is nationwide
Ru@@ pert Steiner , City Chef correspon@@ dent , Daily Mail
it claims that Britain perform their h@@ amm@@ ers and br@@ ushes in favor of the use of qualified East European tra@@ des@@ people , who carry out the work in their home .
if you are sending sk@@ ill@@ fully with a hammer or a pain@@ t@@ brush to set up walls , they seem to be a minority nowadays .
the British increasingly employ handi@@ craftsmen to perform DIY jobs in their homes so the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Véronique Lau@@ ry , new chief Executive Officer of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the tree @-@ dominated chain , said that a big increase in number of skilled tra@@ des@@ people from Eastern Europe , offering services to deep trav@@ ellers , has since been over@@ hau@@ led .
this is why King@@ fis@@ her , 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops is planning to open a set of ar@@ tis@@ ans and closed 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mrs. Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q @-@ shops , because eight out of ten purchase decision included in the shop will be hit by women .
at the moment , the men were silent .
she said it was necessary to exhibit the growing demo@@ graphic trends which feature more female single @-@ households that have more recent renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs. Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we have to shift this stronger into a balance .
in principle , half of our customers consists of women with 80 percent of decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women .
women play a big role in decision process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , also en@@ cap@@ tiv@@ ate its top team to reflect the same number of men and women in executive positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company , which is exactly 50 percent of the teams with women , including its management and financial officer .
Mrs. Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .

because of the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
aries of a@@ I / DO@@ B because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the State Court Kl@@ agen@@ furt , two function@@ aries of the Austrian currency @-@ runner , a@@ I / DO@@ B , have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and deportation .
the def@@ endants were not guilty .
one of them was also charged with authority .
he was acquitted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process was post@@ pon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Robert Ri@@ ffel , had emerged in the preliminary investigation that the def@@ endants in the years 2006 @-@ 2011 had used funds of unification of which they were used to disp@@ ose for private purposes .
they deal with the amount of 400,000 Euros .
the sports function@@ aries are also charged with financial flows .
this fact was eliminated by the Chairman of the Schengen Area , Judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
as a consequence of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the Defence depic@@ ts that the association was to no point on an asset manager .
the sport function@@ aries had been mis@@ calculated and the Sport@@ club , for whom they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and invested much time and money spent in the liabilities - the Passi@@ va tot@@ alled approximately 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time we were facing the situation : do we further train the club or un@@ lock it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the def@@ endants , in the breaking of the bre@@ aches of the financial authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , he decided to take this task .
with all the risks .
&quot; we have shot down money , put our life insur@@ ances in the bank &quot; security , &quot; he said during the intervention .
the association has been agreed : you can only manage the money free , there are only no debts .
furthermore - with appropriate financial support the payout of the allow@@ ance damages had been decided by 1991 .
therefore , one part of the allow@@ ance damages was only years later , namely from 2003 when an increase had been on the account .
therefore l@@ ump sum and not detailed dis@@ closures , explained the former chairman of the former chairman .
accounts and austerity policies administered the two def@@ endants together , saying the second accused .
why the non @-@ withdrawal of the association was not explained in detail , the judge asked .
the association didn &apos;t interest in detail for financial oli@@ gar@@ chs , it is important to have been the debt of debt so the answer .
in 2011 , when investig@@ ating the function@@ ary investigations into the office , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the United Bank account .
the def@@ endants had been that they were indic@@ ative .
this securities account ran on the name of the second accused and , according to whose statements , the association was not known .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to know the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after this , the respon@@ dent did not have an answer .
then he said , He believed that this was the best thing for the club .
if something happened to him , nobody would have known anything of that money , the public prosecutor was in the room .
the co @-@ accused was informed of being informed of the function@@ ary .
this transfer has been form@@ ulated as &quot; calf res@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion . &quot;
why are pollut@@ ants ? , wanted judge and attor@@ ney know .
accordingly , the first def@@ endant declared that he had not been agreed with this formulation , because the association was never a damage incur@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what shall I do when the lawyer tells us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You are all of the Schneider . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal counsel ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , the function@@ ary said he never had to pay a cent content , calcul@@ ating only mileage and di@@ ets .
at di@@ ets he charged 1.000 Euro per month &apos;s charge , however , the actual effort was much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not refer to the def@@ endants .
these are after a working trial , where everything has been judged correctly , not kept for more , declared .
Kilomet@@ ers also used the second accused .
all accommodation can be done in cash , at the same time he has to drive from his place to stay in the Bank of Blei@@ burg , he stated in his testimony .
the trial will be continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard introduces a further 30,000 jobs
in addition to the ongoing recruitment loss for three years , the Compu@@ terri@@ ese will build further jobs during the succe@@ eding branch of the company .
the actu@@ ators with the US @-@ Compu@@ terri@@ esen Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) have no end to this end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30.000 places in its corporate customer .
this means savings amounting to EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion Euro ) , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall under the fourth quarter .
the mining of 5@@ 5.000 jobs has not yet been completed .
during the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 employees .
in stock , the Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Share was 2.3 percent .

time of decision on interest rates to the US @-@ bank@@ note bench
the world observed , if the US @-@ grade bank accounts for two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , come together to make the important decision whether the interest rate has been raised for the first time since almost a decade .
a survey conducted by 80 econom@@ ists representing Reuters was found that a little more than half , the fact that the F@@ ed would do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates will hold on the current state of 0 @-@ 0.@@ 25 percent .
it &apos;s a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rates it at NULL .
&quot; for the first time we approach towards a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Head of Employ@@ ees at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is at a relatively high level of performance , trillion dollars will be added to the balance and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less raw view of global conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has warned the markets to support an increase , but the signs indicate that chances are good against such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot;

death depos@@ itors at Delta State University under@@ gone ap@@ ology
after shooting and killing of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot his counter@@ parts on the day and killed , Sh@@ annon had put a note to say that he would &quot; feel &quot; for the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could not do it , &quot; said the authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that lamb , professor of geography and social scientific education at Delta State University , announced the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and said he had shot on someone , and someone was killed .
therefore , the staff of the emergency call , said the police had to send police officers to his home .
he said , &quot; I enjoyed my wife yesterday evening , &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; cute dog &quot; was in the house , but he didn &apos;t distur@@ b any one , &quot; but probably will be excited .
the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he didn &apos;t give him .
lamb had no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I didn &apos;t want to reverse it .
I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after the writing of the note , Lamb Lub@@ ric@@ ted 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killing when he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police lied him .
University of William La@@ For@@ ge said he knows nothing from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot;
despite the deliber@@ ations on Monday , the Lamb apparently believed that P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s had a relation to Schmidt , said the authorities on Tuesday , there is no information , no proof &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s was written by Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who told her about seven years , when a &quot; good man &quot; was described .
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s have a daughter who is 19 , and she was destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s were her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , that was identified as a close friend of P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s by Sun Herald .
Know@@ les said that P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb has called relatives at a certain date , in order to say to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not go into prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville , later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to the woods , and killing himself with a shot .
lamb received a PhD thesis in Spring 2015 from the Delta State University , which gives his life on the University &apos;s website .

Eu@@ rosci@@ ence : Lufthansa will build the Group around
the Lufthansa plans a wide group structure .
with a better organisation , the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year .
the workforce will cost the workplace 150 of the world &apos;s roughly 1,000 executives around the world .
with the pilot licence , there is in@@ security of the new negotiations .
Lufthansa is building up its business structure and evalu@@ ates the low cost savings .
the real@@ ignment is worth about 500 million euros per year from cost of cost and revenues , the airline divided the airline at Wednesday .
among other things , there is no executive board for the passenger business in the future .
the low cost airline with eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as odd as possible .
in the Chairman of the Executive Team , Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible for the future of Karl Ulrich Lub@@ ri@@ adt for the row@@ ings .
with the introduction of innovation , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ rosci@@ ence with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in future .
to date , the organisation of the 120 000 employees was strong .
the airline operates under the roof of the Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of annual turnover of € 30 billion .

Manchester United can not play for a double frac@@ ture because of the double frac@@ ture
the Champions League defeat at Manchester Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his Right B@@ one in the Champions League defeat at Manchester .
while def@@ ending the lef@@ th@@ est def@@ ici@@ er and closing it for at least six months from playing , Louis van G@@ aal will not give up hope that Sha@@ w can play in this season again .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno within the 15 minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was broken in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated 9 minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was hosp@@ itali@@ zed .
van G@@ aal said : &quot; he has a double leg tin@@ c@@ ture and is located in the hospital . &quot;
it will be re@@ located tomorrow or perhaps one day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United to play it and then takes it fantastic , then it happens .
he had a oxygen mask in the surrounding cabin .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then the six months , and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red map and a penalty of a cub@@ age .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ er person , is not pen@@ alised with the Mexican .
van G@@ aal indicated that the Italian arbit@@ er had to be mist@@ aken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card is due .
it was a very terrible attack with both legs .
a Twe@@ et on the sha@@ ws account asked : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words can &apos;t describe as broken me , my way to recovery begins now , I &apos;m getting stronger again . &quot;
referred to this : Manchester United acquired the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at the PS@@ V
at the European Championship in France , the United Kingdom of England has an additional incen@@ tive to re@@ juven@@ ate itself until the coming of June .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a player leaves the place from violation of the place , everyone is very sad .
it is never the purpose of our players to harm an enemy .
Mor@@ eno suffered a quar@@ ry when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland @-@ Team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; it is very difficult because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the enemy , and if you then hear that it is a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; Coc@@ u said .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , which was in another direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very po@@ or@@ ly with it . I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ play by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows the Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a matter that all parents can learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not last long until you know it almost .
it may be , you may be David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favourite child@@ rens book decided to call Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult election , Cameron wrote in a message on the website of the company super@@ camps , and continued : &quot; fun , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it &apos;s always a picture or a message which we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and well , except that the following paragraph appeared in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book , instead a content of the film version of 2012 , added to the new characters and details to expand the quite brief original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature went and even the air is a commodity , is hoping for a boy named Ted , the heart of Audrey , whose real name was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage , and died in 1991 , however , entirely unknown .
as if this is still not suspect enough : the text from Cameron , which is presented on the website of the Internet Movie Database , which is made on the website of the Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Audrey , the girl of his dreams .
despite being admitted to being a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is not a little familiar to Cameron . here li@@ stens a un@@ named boy , like the local environment , due to the protests of the nam@@ ent Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , colourful beings , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; is rav@@ aged .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per that The Lor@@ ax had not read about 20 times in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street Co@@ atings said that the text may probably come from Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s election office .
super@@ camps confirmed that the text of Cam@@ er@@ ons employees was delivered , but no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th is am@@ big@@ u@@ ously threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult
turning to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one has selected the K@@ ader , the UK for the tour , a repe@@ ating the 3 @-@ 0 Test series is not on my card .
I would not make a down@@ ward victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks Site may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in Batt@@ ing In@@ setting , and the common spirit is strong ; they will not carry s@@ cars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is developing as Sp@@ in Bow@@ ler and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown benchmark on test plane , an option for the attack .
this is related to : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving the UK @-@ Test @-@ K@@ ader and replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is of course difficult to analyze my chief trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyze .
at his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ players are al@@ igned on results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I said that - players are their own best choice .
long ago , one had extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate .
hopefully , when he comes out for further Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance is coming .
the England @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he had not received such good achievements , and it surprises me ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question , how much time a test b@@ ats@@ man receives , to set his characters , is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton was nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back home and moving forward .
the only blame , which it can rise , was that England initially served Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Car@@ ri@@ bean - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is coming in , and he is a bu@@ zz I &apos;m b@@ ays .
he is a X @-@ Factor @-@ Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ eer - what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season when he made us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same chances of receiving it before , but this depends on the team results in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to leave mos@@ ques next to Cook , bringing a extra @-@ Sp@@ in Bow@@ ler and got four Qu@@ icks , di@@ ved , and I didn &apos;t have anything against it .
I don &apos;t see why a bu@@ zz can not strike there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that it is a devil @-@ sk@@ er@@ l from cri@@ cket player .
Mo@@ een perhaps does not run his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire County , but he is a number 3 for her and there is no difference there .
my previous team @-@ mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined himself as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he did not achieve three hundred pe@@ ers immediately and did not return .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the K@@ ader as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people maybe see his statistics on - on average 31 with the bats and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inning , which raises their hands and the train@@ ers have opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some smart supplements at the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ in , the founder of Sri Lanka , could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est not@@ ch of the game who will bring abundance of experiences as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes in for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful effort into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket contest , as a player or coach , and like Mah@@ ela , he has insight into which we can benefit .
sometimes you can bring new voices in the re@@ lin@@ de@@ cabin of fresh winds , even if the messages are in line with the previously healthy .
coll@@ ys te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used on the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that .
some of them will not agree , but cover@@ times and team @-@ manufacturers do not determine the schedule .
and you have to mind that , as in the players , they will depend on their jobs .
such decisions are not taken in a light of heart .
the Bre@@ xit camp ( Bre@@ xit ( out of Britain from the EU ) could gain access to the end of 2017 in a fl@@ aming machine by 2017 .

foreigners also have their cor@@ r@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at friend said that some member states , as deeply mi@@ stre@@ ched into various crises such as the EU is now and not always from own fault , Britain itself produced agenda with split conc@@ essions , and distur@@ bing contract changes that they are mostly not interested , suff@@ iced .
in Brighton , the TU@@ C decided in its annual meeting that it does not like this , if it end@@ anger the social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance ministers climb to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photo of itself in front of a famous local memorial , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they gain allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who wishes to look inside of the EU tent - &quot; Don &apos;t let us alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets us know that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials from some major cities until the point came , where it doesn &apos;t matter if we are or going .
Germany &apos;s war@@ y Chancellor Angela Merkel is a ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office until it looks bad for it , as it did in the exagger@@ ated long way out like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande is looking back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a stunning strength .
Poland might soon have a nation@@ alist rights government , Spain one left .
it &apos;s hard to imagine that they are going to rid themselves a leg in order to prevent the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , to prevent their energy from the UK - something they do not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st ten@@ dencies have .
therefore some such ministers may not even plan un@@ helpful remarks , throughout SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ xit process , my friend believes .
&quot; the re@@ trial was a ple@@ ite &quot; and &quot; Britain has won no value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
the Europeans know how mar@@ gin@@ ally the Fle@@ et Stre@@ ets can be on their expense , and which EU scep@@ tics is the Oli@@ gar@@ chie of the Press@@ eb@@ ar@@ one , as it did not have it during the 1975 refer@@ end@@ ums that supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you may remember Boris Johnson , the ore € twin Opport@@ uni@@ sten , who made himself a name as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his reck@@ oning , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this includes the Med@@ ley of wheel @-@ for@@ cing pl@@ ur@@ ks , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ers , and p@@ seudo @-@ non @-@ foreigners who have the most of our major newspapers .
we thought Tony Bl@@ air thought al@@ way about it , but noted that when you sitting with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you are better distributed to ban@@ anas to leave him , instead of dinner and dinner .
in fact , the Mili@@ band was more bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans than Bl@@ air herself , when he turned down Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s bure@@ tor on the non @-@ approved Constitution of the EU , which was then turned down by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened it to him .
the press has never lost it for him .
but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly little to me on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he had no time left for me - seems to repeat Neil Kin@@ no@@ ck Boy@@ cott Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of 80 &apos;s years , a mistake at that time and today .
it may take but he must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but surely with Andrew Mar@@ r who has left the BBC @-@ sofa on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position in Europe - I &apos;ll get it friendly - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional bl@@ ar@@ ar@@ u@@ rea @-@ tendency and their wil@@ ting wil@@ ds of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can anyone speak to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n &quot; in radio and television this week , when the sc@@ out had fought in it , do not admit that Cor@@ by@@ is &apos;s appointment of prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a shadow ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or was a bad idea .
it re@@ minded me of the 70 &apos;s , when his old father stri@@ ved to be with his Labour MEP , loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet to go without too far and to lose his cabin job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys fight was even more attractive .
but to fight for &quot; stay under all conditions &quot; - Benn@@ s print - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his co@@ ach@@ ers and members after all reports on Monday evening .
whatever the stirring bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to conv@@ ey - do remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV about the clock , and above all in the stru@@ del of Social Media , a breeding ground of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it &apos;s right to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours Supp@@ orting in the final image of a self @-@ understand@@ ability , such as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly does so .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns are fundamental am@@ big@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with its Benn@@ ite @-@ ager@@ ly@@ ric @-@ economy , their anti @-@ capitalist history - is no longer a question of es@@ ot@@ eric debate below left dis@@ sidents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disp@@ utes .

why should Paris or Berlin take political capital , they also have susp@@ icious voters to make conc@@ essions to the British , if all can be meaning@@ less ?

experts critic@@ ise the Public Health U.@@ K. Report about e @-@ cigarettes
claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigarettes have less harmful than smoking created from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) committed to Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing those of Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigarettes .
P@@ he published the &quot; Basic Research Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resi@@ li@@ bility of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an article in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month touched the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ ate basis &quot; in which he founded his principal Con@@ clu@@ sion .
two more researchers write BM@@ J and have wondered if the claims are based on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of Public Administration health at the London School of Hygiene , and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the detection of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expec@@ tation that &quot; The current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes is about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement from a single session of 12 people that were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to lead their opinions on the damage of various nic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ containing products into synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting of a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health was to have their managing director of British American Tob@@ acco Fund ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T on Public Health in a sustainability report , said they .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared to receive funds from a E @-@ cigarettes producer , but not the financing that he must have received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International .
the reasons for selecting the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums are not delivered , but these are several known E @-@ cigarettes champion , of which some also have a sector funding in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting the tobacco running of P@@ he participated too .
the research collaboration of the Group &quot; reveals that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products in most of the criteria &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking will serve &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smoking passes in his ad@@ diction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes is small compared to that , but that we continue to study long term effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has the obligation to inform the public about what evidence of evidence and what does not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative danger compared to tobacco .
nearly 80,000 people die yearly from a sickness with regard to smoking , and smoking costs the national health system worth two billion pounds per year .
by clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of the damage caused by smoking will be able to fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC ought to aband@@ on East@@ En@@ ders , says former CEO of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop to broadcast programmes like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rival &quot; would give her right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square Mi@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio fees should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast through other UK @-@ channels .
he critici@@ zed the BBC that they are publicly @-@ legal programs , likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ controversial time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and by Sen@@ ders , as well as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , said the company had to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to come into contact with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are on behalf or send them that also clearly shown by un@@ subsi@@ dised rival , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said the Ober@@ haus Communications Committee under his investigation into the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the round@@ fee , which I keep in medium or long @-@ term , you should make your production at least in programs that others do not or in order .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window as they want to achieve a wide support for the future .
the idea that nobody would show it would be a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , obviously non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another one , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for that .
I am trying to see how this is to be public @-@ lawful television .
I don &apos;t think this would even reduce the BBC .
Johnson , a business@@ man for series , who led the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for ass@@ essments on the ambi@@ tions &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people working there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC are giving back what is the former Head of Sky , Tony Ball , at his Mac@@ ou@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows as the East@@ er@@ man &apos;s shows .
Johnson said the rather public @-@ legal N@@ ic programs &quot; to go to BB@@ C4 , but they do not measure the audience , but they can argue that when they go to their apparent routes for the jus@@ tification of £ 4 billion . &quot; Well , of course , we &apos;ve created all these ob@@ sc@@ outs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them into a window , where nobody ever wanted to see .
for the Rund@@ funk@@ charge , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a more rainy system in terms of conditions who can obtain the best value from this .
of course , all of us think you think that there is a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who are £ 150 a lot of money , wonder if that is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also told the scra@@ p in front of the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check their r@@ thi@@ an Mission @-@ mission to educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said just a little from the BBC production would officially be classified as a formation . he said that there were 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio . and it should take part in the publicly and free TV channels in Australia and Canada , for example , to inform and enter@@ tain . &quot;
at the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the pro@@ ms of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television are shown to go into television with the commercial broadcasting alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ os@@ genetic &apos; can ste@@ er brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des can change the direction at that moment in which it radi@@ ates with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified crops , which can be controlled from br@@ ushes of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change direction in the moment they have with sound impul@@ ses , who have high frequencies for the human hearing , to be heard , ir@@ radi@@ ated .
pul@@ ses are working through the switching of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on @-@ cells , which are genetically modified to wear the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m channels that are respon@@ ding to ultrasound waves .
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said that worms showed the power of a new procedure , called Son@@ os@@ genetic , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the proceedings of a day could replace the depths brain stim@@ ulation , an inv@@ asi@@ ative procedure that gives electric impul@@ ses in the brain of people for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
F@@ aden@@ oids will usually not react on ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani states that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scop@@ ic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , intensi@@ fy ultrasound waves , which enter into worms .
ultrasound sensors act on structures that are called the TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and in the membran@@ es of some of the worms .
the waves of sound effects are the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells , which they are assigned , like a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms that some of their mot@@ ions are TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
if he turns an ultrasound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro bubbles and transfer@@ ring worms into the worms where they change the modified motor yachts .
the procedure has several simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ ad@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool which scientists allow to switch to neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of the light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , that has to be sent down in an optical fibre to the desired position in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound cream can be hin@@ dered horizont@@ ally and can be sent into the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that the carcin@@ oma and a therapeutic virus is possible to temporarily transform human neur@@ ons temporarily for the ultrasound signal in a clinical attitude for certain neurological treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a realistic delicate company advertisement , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with light fl@@ yers with bright colours and animation it remains more powerful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight gold rules for life in student halls
11 years ago , I considered a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old student residence hall , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remind myself of the ti@@ pped sm@@ iles of those who have sc@@ and@@ alized - and to the numerous , long @-@ long complaints about others .
most of the things I &apos;ve lear@@ nt , can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entrance in student residence halls ranges from easily ner@@ gra@@ zing up to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to p@@ adding : people tell where you come from where and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ on , where you &apos;ll never love Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ haha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Make any questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find people who like you like , unlike those with whom you wouldn &apos;t talk , even if your l@@ ashes are burned in fire and fire extingu@@ ishers .
let people leave you .
people of people often transform themselves in drinks recipes , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people are attrac@@ ting and calcul@@ ating their under@@ wear .
in particular : do not remember to start at the university with a relationship
introduction to a rough handling of the university .
your room should be a refuge , but a lot of student halls form a room @-@ to @-@ room bum@@ ble culture that is friendly and soci@@ ally and can lead to life @-@ life .
this can be hell for someone who is trying to rec@@ u@@ per@@ ate himself .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I love you and I want to keep on our friendship , but you have to go away to stop the energy that I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted of vi@@ vi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
talking of ank@@ ing : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close through baking .
since you start the university at the peak of back @-@ mania , the clo@@ cking at the doors of people to present themselves with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , is less o@@ dd@@ ly than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I baked you something . so , and now please smile , when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
tasty home @-@ made treats are a good way to close friendship .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain himself , and will also associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are an ongoing b@@ aker .
bad mixed lot of flour , sugar and fat always bring down people to sleep when you drop anchor .
food to steal , is a common crime in student dormitories .
of course the c@@ laws of hen is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check with the dairy owner .
chances are good , they say they themselves to themselves , even when they are inside the city .
when someone ste@@ als your stuff , it is annoying , and you have compassion , but try to get more balanced than my fellow worker who added to her milk a rinse tool to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
you should not make any noise , the people from sleep or from work .
it is not only about being an ongoing person , but that in the true sense of the pro@@ ver@@ ts belong to people who sit in gl@@ ash@@ ine .
a girl in my corridor asked their neighbours if it makes them something , drum and bass slightly qui@@ eter than it , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an exam in the morning .
they responded with still loud music .
after all , when she stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , her neighbours gave to sleep two hours before they left their own music , closed her door and went to her three hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future sp@@ ouse would happen to the same student residence by chance ?
conver@@ sely , it would not be aw@@ ful aw@@ ful if you have a co @-@ dw@@ eller for your future sp@@ ouses , to join them again , and would have to see them every day , trying to see how they over@@ took all joint friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot co @-@ person is definitely not your future sp@@ ouse , try at least to talk a little reason .
in the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has its key in its un@@ closed rooms , the border is between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing f@@ oul , than it seems .
a good stretch is fun , but it only takes moments until it becomes bo@@ omer@@ ang .
divide by hiding an important and am@@ using lesson through security - but you never lose any one &apos;s room using tooth@@ paste and shampoo .
close her door , and put your keys in a glass of water that you will then place in the freezer - but put your poss@@ essions on the ceiling no longer than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , stone @-@ making , Ger@@ bi@@ bli@@ ener
the real estate business Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds the centr@@ alized Eck@@ ental terra@@ ced houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
so for refugees - but also as signal : &quot; not just refugees needs a living space , but as well as the only mother and the dog &quot; alone . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to get cheap and build well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner is able to know how quickly a living room can be established : it builds housed in a single project terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
Mr G@@ ild@@ ner , a lot of refugees will push for the residential market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the large @-@ scale accommodation in containers or turn@@ around has no sustainability .
because people remain in a large part here .
in view of the refugee flow , we also need a living room in the coming decades .
a whole , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a terra@@ ced house needs a f@@ ew@@ est place .
it makes it easier to integration .
this is different , when you under@@ take the people in residence blocks .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units each for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees say , it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then , the houses can be converted slightly according to the appropriate needs .
how high are the costs ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the building has lasted for six months .
this is reasonable .
do the legislation simpli@@ fy their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : under the construction of construction , I dra@@ gged my project correctly .
especially complicated makes it always the imp@@ ending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ dear special construction and the positions order .
cre@@ epy .
it is still under@@ lined , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in cities is missing the space .
and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how have the natives responded to their terra@@ ced house ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who have accused me of creating luxury cabins for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely isn &apos;t right .
but are you not tigh@@ tened the cont@@ ention for paid apartments ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : true , we have over the last five years a building boom in Germany , but it was built for luxury apartments that can hardly afford more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the only assi@@ du@@ ed mother or the less ener .
I show how to buy cheap and build well today .
that is why it goes .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple version is released
the new operating system can be required by clicking on &quot; General &quot; and then select &quot; software update . &quot;
if it is ready , you can download the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some problems have encountered problems because they get an error message that means the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to avoid this problem , users are recommended to either wait until the rush returns or to try to update from iTunes .
the phone itself runs through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to make space - but Apple has made it more likely by tigh@@ tening the updates . likewise , it will be easier to delete it if you require a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install if the process is finished .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during up@@ dating , or is near a charging device , so the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued as the phone is possible on hal@@ e ways , and this could lead to a break @-@ away updates .

Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Al@@ ten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft have been merged under the insulation of the social foundation and the Count von Stau@@ ff@@ enberg place a new outlet .
besides consultations , we can also participate in courses there .
the social foundation draws it down from mountain to downtown .
more specifically at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg place .
there recently opened a new district office .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , senior citizens and advice will receive information on questions such as nursing care or services to health and nursing services .
for years , we have been firmly established in our out@@ patient care service that often individuals can be left alone .
there are countless many questions here .
&quot; nor too many benefits of insur@@ ers are not taken into effect , because the complexity of the insurance portfolio is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new bud@@ ding manager at J@@ utta Wei@@ g@@ and , which is also responsible for the &quot; Ama@@ deus &quot; manager and for the ambul@@ atory service &quot; Ama@@ deus &quot; ( also responsible for the out@@ patient service ) .
besides the consultations , the new district office offers prevention , health care and wellness .
in this case the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , you can use additional offers such as crash site , memory training or a physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in the ideal manner .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the veter@@ inary centre for care and care , &quot; Heike Ri@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
the reason for the opening of the new district offices in the city center both see business leaders particularly in demo@@ graphic change .
because this is a good de@@ centr@@ alized infrastructure in the individual parts of Bam@@ berg , in the future , essential .
moreover , by the under@@ lining Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) at the inauguration ceremony , the district office also devoted itself to the compatibility at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to be a regular , sitting presence . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a great contribution that sen@@ iors as possible and can live well in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 o &apos;clock and Saturdays from 10 am to 12 o &apos;clock .

in many places on the country doctors are missing : doctors - As@@ endorf , however , are missing : Dr. Frank Müller is taking place on the field of Fel@@ ris@@ ausen on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ ausen retired , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich occupies his successor in the coming months with half a spot .
after a re@@ building phase , Müller opened the practice of October 12 again until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro in the premises at the St. Mar@@ cell@@ us straße 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when the Fel@@ ris@@ ons met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ gon@@ gol@@ l , who now had completed her medical practice in the g@@ ilded hospital and will also continue to practice this in practice .
&quot; we were always in mind that the m@@ iller would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ ausen and laughs .
&quot; when I was ready , I just called them . &quot;
Müller &apos;s married couple was the idea to operate in As@@ endorf &apos;s own practice in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; close and continuous contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also see his own boss soon .

as of September 19 , the practice of the new boss will be prepared .
while the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ris@@ ausen works as a resident , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) speci@@ alizes in the gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Mü@@ llers , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as a house@@ keeper .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Mul@@ ler @-@ gon@@ g@@ l .
after conversion the rooms will be more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound tests as well as long @-@ term and load @-@ EK@@ GS more and need a speaker room more .
the ED@@ V is also completely renewed .
as part of a grant by a total of 50@@ 000 euros , the Mü@@ llers are given as part of a support program ( € 25@@ 000 ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , the practice will continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sam@@ t@@ ost citizenship Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 2000 people come according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l every quarter in practice Fel@@ ris@@ ings , in the North German course practice it is about 500 .
in As@@ endorf an further medical practice is available .
a positive side @-@ effect of practical experience by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no sequ@@ el had found , it would have gone .
those who attended the hours of Mü@@ llers are still standing in familiar faces : take over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the field .
with their depar@@ ting ends in As@@ endorf an era at least , the medical profession had practic@@ ed 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ ausen shy .
after a little wor@@ m@@ wood they feel after the long time already .
&quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or again and many patients will see many times more frequently , &quot; says the Intern@@ ist .
her husband adds : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; until now I have always pushed me with garden work , now that could be different . &quot;
in addition , the couple had two grand@@ children and travels to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls passed from our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel to the extent .
however , it is clear that anyone who wants to make an application for asylum that can &quot; of course &quot; could do .
the supply and security of the people stand in the fore@@ ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there needs some evidence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people must know that we do not accept lim@@ it@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austr@@ o @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would continue to travel in toward Austria and Germany , under any circumstances also cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
so the Minister of the Interior of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ head Z@@ no@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not see it .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather be the monitoring of the border - mainly to Hungary - intensi@@ fy .
Croatia , on the other hand , was already heavily controlled by the territory of the Schengen area .
as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ es wants to set up his borders for refugees but not factory .
&quot; every EU member has to fill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function &quot; emphas@@ ised Gy@@ ör@@ head Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried to travel in the night hours of Tuesday to arrive in East Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to avoid registration .
the Croatian police was able to gr@@ asp them in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik has ever met with new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
predominantly with Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are also already in action .
in the upcoming days , his country with approximately 4000 refugees , Minister of Interior , said Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo on the Maced@@ onian Serbian border , which previously had brought to the Hungarian border to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade was , however , that it was to suggest the people involved , certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; it stated .
according to media reports , in the morning , a first bus with approximately 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town Si@@ d , in the course of the day , further buses would be expected .
on Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
passengers were on the road through Serbia all night , some 500 kilometres away from the border on the Maced@@ onian border .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has made Hungary , so the police said we should come here , &quot; said one of the refugees .
they wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany .
this could actually be actually to be fore@@ seen by ob@@ servers already predicted shift in the former Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little further west .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
in Croatia , the Minister of the Interior , O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic , empha@@ sized that his country for the fall of a strong hou@@ sings of refugees had prepared plans for potential exceptional situations .
he does not indicate details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member is entitled to a comprehensive range of access to the border control . &quot;
one perform str@@ ingent controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 ; the EU partners have since implemented a good report , which concerns the standards of border controls .
the Serbian border is stuck behind the Hungarian gren@@ zz@@ au@@ n to some 300 refugees .
according to the report of the media reports , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossing horror and port@@ i Bre@@ g remain closed completely .
whether the remaining refugees like to travel on the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Minister of the Interior , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ anovic , on Wednesday morning at a local head office in Hor@@ gos , still tried to calm the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is closed , for earlier .
it would currently not be very high refugee numbers .
it could not be said whether they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or other country .
hel@@ pers for migrants : hazardous - Alternative rou@@ gh@@ ten
however , private hung@@ arian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun putting on refugees land maps in which alternative routes represented by Croatia .
however , border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless . there are still 20 years after the border of the Croatian border , there are still no more spacious mine@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ ut@@ ters were sent to the border region .

F@@ ed@@ Ex tips mixed , financial outlook for 2016 reduced
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the shipping opportunity presents its profit outlook for a whole year because of we@@ aker demand for cargo services and higher charges in its water transport service .
the company also said that she plans to hire some 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for holidays .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share dropped over 2.5 percent at Pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. Announ@@ ces $ 10,@@ 40 and 10,@@ 90 $ in the Fiscal Year , which ends 20 cents less than in the previous forecast .
analysts expected according to a survey conducted by Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
despite the price increases , the average price increases by 4.@@ 9 per cent , and will be effective on January 4 and despite the higher yield for heavy losses of heavy and large packages that will be le@@ vi@@ ed from November .
the company said it nonetheless anticip@@ ates that the result was increased compared to the previous year , due to cost reduction , higher revenues , and due to growth in online trading .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will produce solid revenues , considering the we@@ aker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global commerce .
the plans for holidays employment have been announced a day later than that of the rival UPS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
in the first quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex finished 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
the earnings per share , came to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just below the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research showed analysts predicted .
sales increased by 5 percent to EUR 12.@@ 3 billion .
the analysts expected that six of Z@@ acks were expected to have expected CHF 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex currently showed a decline in international priority shipping , which brought the turnover in its unit Express Shipping to stagn@@ ate .
but the boom in online shopping has increased its results at F@@ ed@@ Ex .
in the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent during the last quarter , but the operating result was fairly flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self insurance .
the Express Unit declined slightly higher prices due to higher prices , while earnings dropped by higher labour costs .
at the Pre@@ market trading , about an hour before opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 per cent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they closed 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most expected meeting in the years Federal Reserve Strat@@ strateg@@ ist two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ o@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to lift the Leit@@ z for the first time since almost a decade .
dro@@ pping over them at an end of the emb@@ ell@@ ished , two @-@ storey conference hall is located a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a memory of the fact that the F@@ ed @-@ President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues put the economic interests of the nation to all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold order from Congress : maxim@@ ization of US employment and prices stable .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ equal third @-@ term mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision to predi@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday if the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned by the unprecedented influ@@ en@@ ching by the close to zero ( short @-@ term interest rate ) since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it is solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets can already make strong F@@ ed representative offices to rein@@ force these vol@@ atility by raising the interest rate for federal government - and it is also only by one percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation primarily will be the most important thing to observe what they are watching &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief economist at the mac@@ er@@ company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to raise the interest rate , increased uncertainty on the global market is sufficient to wait still , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sensus about what the F@@ ed will do , which accounts for themselves in the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists , who recently interviewed by Bloomberg , predicted a rate of interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicators , which indicates only a 30 % chance for an increase .
this indicates a drop in stock market , in case the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strateg@@ ist mil@@ ates the blow , they promise that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial noted an average score of 22@@ 8,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy calcul@@ ates the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief economist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; he said .
if she does , &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets , so that they don &apos;t come in panic . &quot;
other experts argued that a interest rate hike would calm the financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty on when the F@@ ed will act .
even before a month , the F@@ ed appeared on track to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ella had said in spring and early summer , that this year , despite the liber@@ als of liber@@ als , more economic progress would be needed , expecting an increase in the proposition .
although jobs in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement on the job market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years , and close to levels it sees as full @-@ employment .
wage increases have shown signs of a recovery .
and although inflation remained below the Central Bank &apos;s reck@@ oning of 2 % , the F@@ ed representatives showed that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and takes them because of tension in the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Head of Music at Pan@@ the@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets placed all over the world in the end of the month after China had cancelled its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial above fell in May by more than 16 % below its high level when investors feared that a slow@@ down from the Chinese economy would push global growth .
the market has recovered in this month , the Dow Jones are now nearly 10 % below the h@@ ype of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives influence market turbul@@ ence , the complex calculation , when one should increase interest rates .
&quot; if the events occur on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of Chinese economy in the past few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low , said on the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the US @-@ bank@@ note .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get the impact better in the handle .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty on what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; O@@ liner said .
the health of the world economy is none of the main interests of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be involved in its decision @-@ making .
but in the end the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the she@@ er note of the then Managing Director Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could enter their mon@@ eti@@ ological expansion , &quot; causing confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies , increasingly inter@@ woven , can be expected by the F@@ ed representative , that they will not only monitor the developments at other locations , but also with other central banks and experts to maintain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more arts as science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a story of over@@ flow on financial market movements that apparently doesn &apos;t be linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
L@@ acker , the legitimate member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which places an interest rate for interest in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its Leit@@ z by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three meetings &quot; despite some noticeable effects on growth in the US . &quot;
one year later , the F@@ ed representative accounted for these cuts .
the F@@ ed should only put aspects of financial stability during a severe crisis as the market collapsed in 2008 , Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee for interest in the Bank of England .
the recent turbul@@ ence does not come close to this level , he said .
&quot; she surely doesn &apos;t want to enter the situation in which she &apos;s afraid of an interest rate for interest , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act is still counting the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until this is changed , I do not think it should ha@@ sten the time .

Brazilian pedi@@ atric society Rio Grande encour@@ ages nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS tries to clear women on how important good diet is during the lac@@ tation . she does this with the presentation of images of babies that are painted in breasts , which are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
mother &apos;s milk is composed of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , which give babies every nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are going to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary amend@@ ment to the mothers .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy eating pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , a un@@ healthy diet of the child can influence the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ ades
the Municipal Council Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the € 2.3 million sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ sigh@@ ted turn@@ around at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports ground are step forward by step forward : in recent municipal authority , the revised building contract has been ra@@ ined without great discussions .
before that , the body among others had decided to apply a request for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; respect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the existing construction plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was given the permit for a special form on the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a consequence , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle @-@ roof with non @-@ mit@@ er first and sky@@ line &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the background , the planned use of the roof space for solar plants is : &quot; for this we get a wonderfully large south roof together , &quot; Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger stated in the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again , it was about the bad@@ ger that was prescribed for energetic reasons - other than in the development plan - below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volumes of the building is therefore clearly reduced .
therefore , exemp@@ tion was necessary because the development plan for the roof dis@@ appro@@ ves no &quot; exceptions &quot; - with the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council , normally more restric@@ tive for the contrac@@ ting jobs .
however , at the turn@@ around it is no recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gym hall at the Sports Centre is a community project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .

Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is scheduled to be closed in early as planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is a new medical director at Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au around .
this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district court , the bur@@ ial of Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
however , the Supervisory Board does not meet the supervisory board , and meets it on Wednesday , September 23 .
if the plans were implemented , all of the almost 50 employees would continue at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the overwhelming majority should react with fishermen and the further existing center to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are present .
the cow@@ or@@ kers who can not go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in W@@ eil@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
the employees were informed about the plans .
triggered the change of resignation from Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been medical director of Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the beginning and now changes to a private practice in immediate proximity to the hospital .
the question , who should step up the succession , came according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; into the game , which declared itself ready to take over the line from 1 October and to fight with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this means an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and an enrich@@ ment of the range in the field &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist in pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the inner station on gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
over the next two years , fishermen with his team , when the Supervisory Board is to agree to have both homes , until then in next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ esset , which has yet to be closed after almost 140 years , must finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
so far , the administrative district had planned for 2018 , when the current rehabilitation was completed at the W@@ eil@@ heim hospital .
Tra@@ itor J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , which is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , made rum@@ ors that the House , which is owned by the Federal Council , will in future be used as an asylum seek@@ er for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; I &apos;ll close it . &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say there were several consider@@ ations .
there are currently a short @-@ term pe@@ dic@@ ure of Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; something better could not happen to us , such an opportunity won &apos;t come back , &quot; says Fischer over the Qu@@ asi move to Le@@ ch , who had been &quot; positively and comprehen@@ sible by the staff . &quot;
a real perspective for the house , where fishermen , for more than 30 years , has been working as a chief doctor .
he has been asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
in the past few decades the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) have been threatened again from closure , departments have been closed , for example the surgery and birth aid .

after a shot of cast an 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old men were heavy injuries and were taken in hospitals .
however , as precisely the accident could occur , was first un@@ clear .
the C@@ ID was determined .
mixed 16 @-@ year old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pfalz for non @-@ violence crimes
a crime susp@@ icious has led the police for the body , the last 16 year old , from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
in the interro@@ g@@ ation the 20 @-@ year @-@ old gave birth to young people and had thrown her dead into a canal in rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
the 16 @-@ year old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate has been mixed for a violent crime .
the young woman &apos;s body was found in Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern at the Tuesday evening , such as the public prosecutor and police on Wednesday afternoon .

refugees need accommodation : study warns on vac@@ ations
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
also , more refugees seek a affordable stay .
the pressure on the residential market is growing .
the social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution strip on the German housing market has long been begun .
with the upcoming refugees and working people from the EU , more people push for a market , which is now over@@ loaded in many great cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens to compete for the last paid apartments .
in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400,000 new units would have to be built .
to this result , a study on behalf of the association &quot; Social housing building . &quot;
for comparison : 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany this year .
in this case , 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are not oblig@@ ated to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial base .
many are step@@ ping down on the housing market and lined up in the long sn@@ akes before the apartments .
according to the Federal Office of Statistics , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers were registered in the last year .
however , the negative development of residential property is not only the increase in refugees .
the study also makes considerable confusion in housing policies of the last years .
Germany sho@@ ots are moving forward , which is greater from year to year .
currently in the metrop@@ olitan areas , about 77@@ ,000 units were already registered , including Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many jobs , therefore , lived in large cities of not@@ ions in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed longer because of the ground on the housing market un@@ will@@ ingly in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square metres per capita has fallen back for the first time in recent years .
in order to solve this problem , the Alliance &quot; Social housing building &quot; suggests a re@@ boot .
on this occasion , new incen@@ tives are to boost the social housing .
thus , on the property tax , the property tax could be dispens@@ ed and the property tax for funded housing are to be suspended .
in addition , the alliance guarantees attractive tax depreciation and actu@@ ation opportunities .
the support program for refugee cons@@ ults in the State Bank of Kf@@ W is already well established in cities and communities .
a good week after the start was raised by 184 million euros by the start of the Monday evening by 184 million euros .
now the project could be increased .
refugees have free funds : Croatia and Slovenia setting up a corridor
after Hungary , practically no coming through , there are more refugees going on the way over Croatia .
Zagreb announces that transit across Slovenia to the north , without a hur@@ dle .
dangerous is the route , however .
Croatia aims to communicate Slovenia at the neighbouring country of Slovenia about the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I talked with the Slovenian interior minister , and when it is necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already a Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not a Schengen country .
following the termination of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees are broken down to Croatia to reach Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the German TV broad@@ caster RTL reported .
at the day before , Hungary had closed its border for refugees .
new laws which occurred in force on the same day are unnecessary asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ anovic explained : &quot; you can travel , and we prepare ourselves for this possibility . &quot;
these people are there , women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something .
however , there are people who would not want to live in Croatia .
Croatian police attacked the first refugees at the Serbian border on the border of Serbia in the morning of Serbia .
most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they were both with the bus and taxi to the Serbian border town Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival , they would have attempted to walk through the green border to Croatia .
the refugees at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border do not viol@@ ate the refugees .
the border trail leads to other dangers : there are sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
min@@ ers are now to create a safe passage .
after the closing of the border , hardly more refugees arrive after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday the police hosted 3@@ 66 pointed people .
shortly before Tor@@ sten on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws raise the over@@ coming and damage of the Gren@@ zz@@ a@@ uns as off@@ ender .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were introduced in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
sentenced to five years in prison sentences and the deportation of the country .
according to the Immig@@ ration Authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; transp@@ oses &quot; border , almost all of them - 93 - on the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicant be 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning , there were still 40 refugees detained .
practically nobody has received a view of granted asylum in Hungary .
as a Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot;
the alleged asylum seek@@ ers are to be deported there .
before the &quot; tran@@ se@@ ones &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke only a few hundred refugees were gathered .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke started to car@@ ve workers .
they collected the waste , which tens of thousands of people left the road in the last weeks .
the grid was disman@@ tled , and one of the recording @-@ camps in the boundary was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express the goal of this upgrade .
Austria depends on the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary only a few refugees .
moreover , the country has intensi@@ fied its border controls .
however , around 20,000 migrants were still stuck in the country .
in Salzburg , 1400 people are waiting for the drive to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by the German authorities .
in Freil@@ assing , smaller groups of refugees met regularly for refugees .
Mayor of &quot; rocks &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were looking for the bridge floor on Sunday with ev@@ acu@@ ating , when ten people suddenly stood by travelling at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ ern@@ st@@ one Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany was suddenly stopped on Sunday but because of refugee est@@ ro@@ ms the railway traffic was stopped with Austria , in W@@ ern@@ stein , the city who immediately offered his help and set the stran@@ ded along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border to Nah@@ e Pass@@ au .
before we first got the un@@ hop@@ eless guests only once , with snack and beverages .
we have said the same way , we bring them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; that was of course , &quot; the city council in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation .
they were very grateful .
a man would not take it to pass a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; that made us very happy , &quot; says Stad@@ ler .
the ri@@ dden train passengers increased in W@@ els on Sunday evening in W@@ els from an ICE train to a regional train in Direc@@ tion that the railway traffic was stopped by Germany , but to try again about the border .
however , the train was placed in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s border in front of the border .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the bridge festival with the Bavarian neighbours signed on Sunday , a couple of years ago , organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is now sending a further delay to us , is a logical result of a seem@@ ingly holy policy :
instead of emp@@ loying structures in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately in building structures guarant@@ e@@ eing human@@ ism , our Federal Chancellor is highly official and publicly advanced the position of the Hungarian government in the dun@@ geon of National Soci@@ alism .
bodies of this policy are not only those Austrian who are now faced in the border areas with cha@@ otic conditions .
the poultry are also found to find that the &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land , &quot; which they invited and welcome , nothing but another refugee camp .
there will be a major challenge , in view of the per@@ sist@@ ently refugee streams and the approaching winter , building decent conditions for protection seeking us .
and there will be another major improvement in Austria - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 35@@ ,000 hi@@ ber@@ ing Qu@@ arti@@ stes
Konrad has filled with the refugee offering all hands full .
Christian Konrad is he in his position that his word has weight .
the government has used the former Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to set up quarters for thousands of refugees .
still the chaos in the reception center Tra@@ fal@@ kirchen has already reached a grip .
&quot; we don &apos;t have homeless people in Tra@@ fal@@ kirchen , &quot; he told of his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the placing of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday would be without great host , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master@@ piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Interior Minister , however , spoke of a &quot; poor situation . &quot;
a total of 8@@ 5,000 Qu@@ arti@@ ler@@ ses anticip@@ ates a total of 8@@ 5,000 qu@@ ads in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations must be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are expected to provide 15,000 people .
should there be more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there is no barrel without the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the local cent@@ ur@@ ers he has already led talks .
they would have ensured for him , even for the upcoming refugees to make Qu@@ arti@@ ere .
&quot; in Upper Austria things are going well , &quot; Ferry Mai@@ er said .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , that will be clari@@ fied , as the church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; great expectations are the right of the asylum @-@ coordin@@ ators in the ORF @-@ action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping as we . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can provide un@@ complicated accommodations .
moreover , one is hoping for hotels that are empty in the winter .
Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for the accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of times it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ers have to stick to a certain height of the manuscript holder or size of the upper arms .
for a temporary time , &quot; staff standards &quot; would have to apply .
contrary to the Ministry of Interior regarding the Ministry of Defence , Konrad , with his experience .
I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not speak without another &apos;s face .
surplus power is his most important weapon .
Conrad and Mai@@ er cause the Republic to no cost as they declared themselves .
their employees want to increase their number to four to four .
so far our own search results has not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to place a container at st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz required a better arrangement
no opening of urban sports and other buildings such as hin@@ ts @-@ arena and design center for the housing of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is no need for this moment , since it is possible to accommodate those affected by these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for emergency , however , further locations should be tested on their suit@@ ability .
critic@@ isms at the Chief Executive Officer of the refugees in the federal state .
other districts too must contribute here .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) received a further procedure in the refugee question on Monday .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic was still possible .
however there is now the appropriate border controls .
special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer be available .
however , the seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular moves to Germany .
by the other EU member states , P@@ urged for once more intensi@@ fied solidarity in refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that now Austria will lead inspec@@ tions to its borders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the Germans &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a matter of time
the general restoration of the &quot; Neue Werft shi@@ pyard in the Lin@@ zer Industrial Line is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of the office and production facilities , the listed IT group S &amp; T is dra@@ fted , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) should be rented in young , innovative companies from the technology industry .
&quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he can imagine , in start @-@ up companies of the New Shi@@ pyard , and later it could also explo@@ res .
from the beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - what does Nieder@@ haus@@ er promise : &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
EUR 1.7 million were invested in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Centre , which belongs to one @-@ third of the city of Linz , Austria Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is designed by Linz AG for 60 years in S &amp; T and Tech@@ Centre .
about 30 percent of 2700 square meters of total area in the building are already rented , for further 40 percent there are requests .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have taken a long time to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Bre@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was , among other things , that even the for@@ la manufacturers , who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of a own site where only their hand@@ bags will be sold .

why such a woman when looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , the wife can not answer any final safety .

the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ al@@ zer &apos;s ancest@@ or of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place called an@@ alogy .
this property also links the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
whether it expresses foreign hos@@ tility , journalists wor@@ ries about or knowledge g@@ aps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the United States Presi@@ dency beat the election campaign migh@@ ti@@ ly .
and cuts down well .
this is also recorded at the pf@@ alz k@@ all@@ stadt where the grand@@ parents would come from the real estate of millions .
the New Yorker with the con@@ cili@@ ary eats a lot in the wine village on the wine route .
man@@ cher in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant village is over @-@ hear@@ ted corners with him .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pfalz : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his objective , more powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find that somehow exciting , but are not too deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter kind , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has directed a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous co@@ ders , besides the ump of Tr@@ ump , even the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump , which is not known for circumcision , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) also to word - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has not brought it to the king of his heart .
indeed , there is respect for the performance of the family , but even the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; is already a bit la@@ zy , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally , the nickname &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; came in coinci@@ dentally , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - too High German : the investors , says she .
the pump comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began 1885 , when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold@@ s@@ lan@@ ders in the US .
the real estate of the real estate company were first basic sales in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : her wish to return to the homeland in duration of the Bavarian State was one of the Pal@@ atine .
he was not admitted to Tr@@ ump , because he once said without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the director of the Institute for History and Ethno@@ graphy , Roland Paul , explains the film start .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal immigration . &quot;
this is contra@@ sted by contrast to the concer@@ ted statements of the descendants .
he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of an border wall to de@@ d@@ eter illegal immigrants .
&quot; as it is not so lik@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote relative tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a native of ump , the op@@ a was bor@@ n@@ ated Heinz &quot; ) .
the win@@ eg@@ row@@ er in retired sees the Americans rather dist@@ anz@@ ingly , &quot; he is ever so thousand . &quot;
do he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never cared about the city of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pen@@ it@@ ress of Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like man@@ cher K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz came to a visit to the Church &apos;s organ , which was generally well connected .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine the Donald &apos;s , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
it is better if he won &apos;t win the election , because &quot; He created such radical views , I do not know whether this is good . &quot;
if those who were in the United States at the time of his grandfather had been doing that , like he , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Creator Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are mature also without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
W@@ end@@ els film , for whom Tr@@ ump has been interviewed for a long time , have seen 12 000 cinem@@ at@@ chers , also in the USA w@@ akes interest .

Karl Stef@@ anovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son allows Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of leadership of the liber@@ als , but has no major shifts in the ratings for Today &apos;s ratings .
the breakfast show of Nine was aired by the federal capital , after Malcolm won the down@@ fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Cook and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ days , put in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international TV shows that also Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Cancun .
this dis@@ advantage of the insur@@ rection appeared to play any role for Australian TV spectators , because Sun@@ rise posted an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators on the five main cities , compared to today &apos;s 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today Today &apos;s a slight increase of the ratings on Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ ,000 ) .
today Today in the last months , Today finally closed the gap to sunrise .
in August , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ ,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the gap between 40,000 and 50,000 .
Sun@@ rise has risen at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at Today in September .
this is the most interesting thing every morning .
the winds of change affect this morning people more than the parliament !

secrets reveals ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay , and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki possibly have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly , who wins the Bachelor wins .
the woman , finally landed at the Bachelor Wood in The Bachelor , has been wrapped in largest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining drunk girl will surely not give away if she is the one that has received the last Rose .
but when we check@@ up with Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows on the day before check@@ out of three , you possibly have acci@@ dentally given a hint on who to be the winner .
Sam Wood continues his lips till the final on Thursday
all three women have left out to ly@@ rical issues why Wood is the perfect man and called his mind for hum@@ our , am@@ bition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should become Woods &apos;s last Rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may their answers to the play@@ mate who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki always called both - Mack@@ ay &apos;s best partner for Wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a long relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I entered the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought this throughout the course of the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows told .
&quot; Sarah is standing on earth with both feet on earth , making it so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I saw them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood are well @-@ suited as a couple .
from their point of view , Mack@@ ay said that the last week &apos;s visit was her clear that Wood &quot; could be &quot; One . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this obviously isn &apos;t just a game - I &apos;m already locked up on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked where Wood should choose , if not she , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say this , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor &apos;s Bachelor is on air on Wednesday , 19 : 30 on Wednesday .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle marked great interest after moving to the U.S. - and there were many other teams who sent to an impressive look at the end of last year .

some of the train@@ ers would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ or as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rug@@ by League conver@@ ti@@ t when his first P@@ unt @-@ return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 win against Minnesota .

Hay@@ ne moved the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble , and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not have a wor@@ sen@@ ing start in his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing , this happens now , one just cares about the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 people killed , after police bul@@ let mig@@ rate on prot@@ esters in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal after demonstr@@ ating rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd , demonstr@@ ating against the proposed new constitution , said an official on Wednesday .
violence broke out on Tuesday night in the ru@@ pe@@ e district of Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi , 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , head office official , said that over 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , some of them gave stones and inc@@ endi@@ ary bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police have used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and shot in the air before they handle her rubber bul@@ lets .
20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used , of which it is known that they can kill , but are traditionally used as a less le@@ thal alternative , apparently produced as a high rate of death .
the discussion was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nepal where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ gan@@ i say that new provinces that are formed within the proposed new constitution would l@@ essen their political influence .
there were also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were killed in violent cl@@ ashes since the 10 .
killed in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country in provinces - an important step in the direction of a new constitution , but a controversial issue in Nepal , which has been controlled for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legisl@@ ature have agreed this week to certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional design in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .

easily overweight diabe@@ tics can be helpful in weight loss surgery .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for slightly over@@ weigh@@ ty people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is too early to tell if lightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery is longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery that wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the weight loss plan or obesity surgery use different methods to reduce the size of stomach .
they reduce hunger and lim@@ iting the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity treatments have been proven efficient in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies were performed in people who have disease @-@ fat @-@ lac@@ ed with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more indicates someone is overweight , and people with a BMI of 30 are considered ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI below : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare these two types of obesity surgery - Mag@@ b@@ ypass and mag@@ nific@@ ant - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes with people who were easily overweight .
average BMI below those who under@@ go this operation decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile the BMI in those who had non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments remained roughly equal to 29 .
among the one that underwent surgical procedure performed in 36 % of the diabetes disease , and with 28 % in part .
in the medical @-@ treated group , diabetes dis@@ band@@ ed only by one percent compared to the diabetes and sometimes only about 2 percent .
moreover , the results were in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ ols , &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical group &apos; , the authors found out .
the researchers also supervised the blood level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
the em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is thought to be below 7 percent , write the researchers .
after operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c levels fell by roughly 9 percent to about 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group there remained stable at about 8 percent .
but these better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c levels - reduced not the mortality in five years , so the leading researchers Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also earned average results on the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gas rec@@ tom@@ y group ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , larger return courses within the BMI ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ coming of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study has no survival benefit from surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden who leads operations to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was a obesity epidemic which had under@@ gone an O@@ bes@@ ity surgery approximately 29 percent less likely to die during the period of 15 years - compared to a group that tried the conventional methods .
although the new study has no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it &apos;s soo@@ thing for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; she said .
Black@@ stone added that humans and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously once the patient is at BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting for too long , until we bring people this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think as soon as they have accumulated this genetic changes , which have linked their body with obesity and diabetes , it is really difficult . &quot;

&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe could not include all refugees , the Dalai Lama , and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis is in the Middle East .
the Tibetan Buddhist leaders urged to end violence in the countries of refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis to the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , which is devoted to eth@@ ics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be asked with the interests of individual nations or even continents .
he also empha@@ sized that the reaction of the West European countries on the refugee crisis seems to be admi@@ red , but the situation is not adequate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to overcome the crisis , he stressed that there was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you must re@@ think about long @-@ term solutions , like a real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we must re@@ consider how the killing is reduced in their countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of violence never solved these issues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence as well as George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of Sept . 11 and pointed out that the US &apos;s violent response moved to a chain of un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I summar@@ ized my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him , the way to resolve this subject is non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he set violence , and that was unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of consumption of dis@@ infection by children in the last 4 years
poison controversial centres in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , the highly alcoholic manual dis@@ infection , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of mobile dis@@ infection in children under 12 years of age , le@@ thal control centres increased , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are getting more common in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go to the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN .
he said that some children &apos;s disinf@@ ect@@ ant will drink up , while some will do to im@@ press their friends or because of a mut@@ ually for social media .
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ infection products only drink because of cheap experiences .
young people have allegedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ant with non @-@ alcoholic mouth@@ wash@@ es to get harder and harder .
younger children can be guided by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said .
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who are par@@ ked .
there are dis@@ infection with strawberry , grapes and orange du@@ ps , which are very pleasing for children .
suspended disinf@@ ect@@ ant contain between 45 and 95 per cent alcohol .
few small sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning especially in infants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the University of Kansas , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you would not leave no gul@@ p of whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children are coming to it , it is a fast way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ehem@@ jah Russell , a six year old girl who recently had four sy@@ ring@@ es from after strawberry fl@@ atter@@ ing dis@@ infection in the school , was taken to treatment .
her blood @-@ alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold being used by an adult law , said Dr. Chris K@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency medical professional , who treated them in the winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
then hai@@ red her words and wasn &apos;t able to go where she arrived in the emergency department .
doctors obe@@ yed them over night in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen by the alcohol and pushed his head , said Rit@@ ter@@ ey .
&quot; that was very wor@@ ris@@ ome , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , the N@@ Hai@@ tian mother , CNN .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ infection products outside the child &apos;s reach .
over alcohol pois@@ oning , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with death cases .
in 2013 two women in Ontario died after the swal@@ lowing of suspended dis@@ infection , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .

I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think that players are looking forward to it .
the lack of cover competition in Scottish football bo@@ res Dut@@ chman - de Bo@@ er
the former Rang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and earlier @-@ player national player in the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic people , there is no title rival with the Rang@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of Celtic people more and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams together and that is what they are interested .
there are a lot of tension in the Old and Fir@@ m games , and there are not just people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will rotate the things , swe@@ ars by D@@ eila .
R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eila accepted that Celtic people must fight , but the Norwegian leader swore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent resignation from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now consists of five points ahead clearly at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ eila said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel it exactly this way - but we must go on .
we really really need the support of Celtic people , because that makes the players better .
to assemble now , it is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ tious in January @-@ transfers
in spite of his comments before just a few weeks ago that he hur@@ ried to susp@@ end some January @-@ transfers , Rang@@ ers boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ ti@@ ously with the signing of new reach and insi@@ sts that it does not want to distur@@ b the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x @-@ Ka@@ ze .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January @-@ transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players who come in the summer have this pre@@ season time to integrate with what you &apos;ve seen with our own group in this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes , more damage will be caused by adding un@@ related players to what you really need .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while they are increasing in the United Kingdom .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in the period of May to July , while the number of people without a work for the United Kingdom rose to $ 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million during the same period .
the Scottish unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was beyond the 5.5 % Ukrain , as the figures of the National Statistics Office ( for dating only ) showed .
in the meantime , the employment of Scotland fell 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent during the quarter - a figure above the annual average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation stone for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year that Scotland made the historic decision to stay part of the United Kingdom .

why I become a witness to an execution in Oklahoma .
somewhat later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it will not happen , I will sit in a Viewer Gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by le@@ thal injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation was for the first time in January regarding his best friend , and even though I was shocked , I agree .
when the day came closer , I began to fear myself .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and there are often more applications than places available , a mac@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected .
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
whoever is selected , will see it emotion@@ less .
I don &apos;t know that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps close friend , with whom I developed my own relationship during the months with telephone numbers and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot , when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist , so it will not allow me to take a notebook &amp; pen , to record what I see .
I simply have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Oklahoma cast me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants to , and you get access .
I compl@@ ained with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she could have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better phr@@ asing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problems with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can be removed from his list of witnesses to any time .
but he wants to be an international reporter to write there .
when he dies , he thinks the public relations of the movement will assist the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a reporter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is sitting next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of Podcasts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a fav@@ oured process .
but I think that a strong lik@@ el@@ ihood is that it is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is no sufficient evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this point I will see him die .
I can &apos;t claim to be truly objec@@ tively .
there will be other rep@@ orters , to which you can turn .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man an unnecessary death .
man after dam@@ p police ch@@ ain@@ ring talks to come from the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale poli@@ tic was still dry when he was a man to the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man from Perth to crash the police was un@@ successful when he found himself in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters from a police officer , who tried to persu@@ ade Him to come back to the shore . &quot;
the C@@ anning V@@ ale police was called into a squ@@ ad @-@ demo@@ lition in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in water and said &apos; I am not coming out , come and get me , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine .
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c wasn &apos;t all too excited to make his uniform , hence he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people make funny things trying to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .

in 2006 , cou@@ sins used to escape his car into the tren@@ ches to escape an alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to sp@@ ade him and threat@@ ens to end racing sports
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he ste@@ amed the ste@@ wards and the integrity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they led a personal campaign against him with the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race of race treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do that which is best for racing , and he himself found himself under difficult conditions when it went to the positive cob@@ alt @-@ T@@ up@@ a sample at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
he had with@@ held 18 months because of the sp@@ ying accus@@ ations , and didn &apos;t want it to be as tall as tall grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about this and I &apos;ve been eating for a long time , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know it was going on .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with it what I said .
I will go home today and sleep well .
I would like to walk up the head , and I would like to think that my owners are thinking that I &apos;m trying to try my best .
if you start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a coach .
I then have to consider what I do with my license .
before , Moo@@ dy had tried the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had attempted to sp@@ ade his stable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight months ago , Terry Bailey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr Brian Stewart in a room with a man - whom I will be asked when I am asked - and offered him an employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy at Rac@@ ing.com . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you believe , that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly be able to express their n@@ oses , because it is trying to hold me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , CEO of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , announced at its time and are still today .
should I bring that in mind that it will be personally ?
has the Route L lo@@ dges and makes people responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside , that I am it .
maybe they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say to think about it now .
but now I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
it really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and pushing them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the Fru@@ it levels of the trainer developed on Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt testing , and the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led him that he said &quot; he could throw his license on the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ lag@@ ged Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race treatment treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the drawn carriage , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take the full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has er@@ ron@@ eous mud on the leg .
it could have been like this night .
it could have been like yesterday all the day , which was so .
but it was so on the racing day .
Moo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the package at the racing day . an inquiry into this matter was opened .
it &apos;s a joke .
people who set these rules don &apos;t know anything about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy defe@@ ats against ri@@ vals for claims to ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kling his player as a &quot; Agenda @-@ S@@ etting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee of the Storm @-@ player &quot; Ring@@ fight &quot; talked with his team during the high @-@ stop final in Sydney &apos;s qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night .
Brisbane Bron@@ co Trainer Wayne Bennett made a hardly p@@ aving note to the Storm team after having scored his final victory against North Queensland cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Rug@@ by League and said the two out of Queensland do not &quot; good &quot; in the R@@ ingen .
Bell@@ amy defended the bag of his crew and said that they just concentrate on their &quot; contact &quot; at the tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers in his team were confident that they were worried they were worried about the Storm @-@ Team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s always up again - I haven &apos;t heard Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring fighting when she told us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our def@@ ensive system or techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks , we have made our contact with tac@@ kles for a real focus , and that has provided the trend revers@@ al for us .
Tr@@ ent is now there for three years , and he obviously has a great crew to train . he probably isn &apos;t used to losing it , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it &apos;s strange already , as this is always occurring again at this time of season .
Bell@@ amy has attacked his ment@@ or from the &quot; exciting soccer team &quot; and rec@@ alled to its ment@@ or that Benn@@ i St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier@@ ship in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wayne talks about thri@@ lling football .
he has compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 , St George was a boring team , and Wayne said that he would take care of a sh@@ it .
but now he has a team that can play and watch it as exciting , especially its young players with their speed .
that &apos;s the ball game you &apos;d like to play if you have this type of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt , making them how they can play .
I build up confidence because they say these things , because they &apos;re a bit worried not to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ ster increased a higher result as the game Bron@@ co vs. Cow@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is that a thri@@ lling game ?
or are breaks and no points a little tension ?
for me it &apos;s the Schedule .
when they mention it , it means that we will meet on them in a phase .
the Storm @-@ Team has won over this weekend , as they have won the right , either North Queensland cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks at the final Saturday night in A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales starts off the next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 US deposit after drug @-@ clinics
a man who may possibly have a lifetime subject to come after his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were spar@@ ed by Queensland , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the police had found 100 kg of the drug at the yacht Sol@@ ay , arrived from South America over V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilos of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life imprisonment for trying to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic ar@@ gues that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan was concerned about the floods at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relationships with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
at the cause he was lied to police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
as a security deposit of $ 200,000 dollars , Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics Mother and his father &apos;s father offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 in order to achieve his release .
&quot; after reading the worn aff@@ id@@ av@@ its of these two persons , it is clear that the circulation of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; Judge Flan@@ agan said .
but it will not be enough to stick it away from it , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he ab@@ stain@@ ed from his Australian and Serbian passport , at the end of the police and at a power lock of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone of girls to enti@@ ce ped@@ oph@@ ile to s@@ ash pictures
a ped@@ oph@@ ile used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when this slept , log@@ ging into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ disputed images of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she looked at it , found the most conf@@ using messages and al@@ arms instantly their mother .
the police took care of this and saw the five images , analysed the computers that were found under the address and discovered the question &quot; Web @-@ resear@@ ches , &quot; the terms used for un@@ inten@@ tional images of children .
H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials to have done this because it would lead to &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile in the internet , &quot; and he then &quot; gave a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten her . &quot;
the State Prosec@@ ution E@@ ili@@ ie Robertson also said the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a addi@@ ct that he was addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people .
he admitted that his searching was done on the computer of him , but said it was done , because he wanted to ass@@ ert a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten her ped@@ oph@@ ile .
he was asked after his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send even more photos .
he said he did to l@@ ure her .
he said he was ill in his mind if he drinks , and said he wants to see images of rape and murder .
MS Robertson added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was at tre@@ mor and weeping .
she also saw the def@@ ensive pictures on the phone and con@@ front the def@@ endants .
the girl got interviewed and said that the accused was us@@ eless Computer and Play@@ station to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , declared guilty on the basis of the indictment , to have taken up inde@@ cent pictures of children on the 14th of June of the year to have viol@@ ate the regulations and did not appear before the court hearing on 24 March this year .
in defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g could not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , because you would argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his passing .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael bl@@ amed the verdict until October , to get background reports about social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted in this case but due to hear@@ ings on other conditions ob@@ taining in custody .
he was before the date of judgment entered into the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .
do@@ dging soft on small border crossing to Germany
more and more refugees are out@@ stretched out the major controversial point at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many locks from fear of discovery and capture the people multiplied to smaller border entran@@ ces
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man for the federal police said .
along the border of the border , Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn have been taken up more than 1,000 refugees in the county circles Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
they were walking towards bridges and dust @-@ ri@@ fl@@ es on the German side .
there they are arrested by federal police in reception and for@@ warded to the registration .
at the Munich Main Railway Station , following the start of the first time , the company again increased significantly more refugees at the start of the first day on Wednesday .
some 700 people have arrived in the capital alone until 8 : 00 AM , a speaker at the morning .
after re@@ introducing controls on the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city .

the mass itself makes it : &quot; every two years the car@@ makers show their new developments at the IAA .
in 2015 , the compact vehicle is especially well @-@ selling for cars that are especially well @-@ selling .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 2@@ 8.1 percent of new appro@@ vals accounted for by the Kraft@@ fahr@@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) alone in August in this segment .
this also reflected at the IAA ( Public@@ ation days 17 - 27 September ) .
a lot of new compact models will be presented between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concept and new luxury cars and luxury cars this year .
one of the largest premier@@ es for the German car industry is the Opel Astra line , which will be at the dealers in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann talked to the show .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five squar@@ em@@ akers are human un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ in@@ mate of the Te@@ gel &apos;s pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , which has been housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human rights , prisoners are basically eligible for financial compensation if they are incar@@ cer@@ ated in small cells .
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
need@@ les to say , judges may even hope for money if they were confin@@ ed only a few days in the confin@@ ement areas ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
he was a ex @-@ mate with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe , Germany : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with around five square meter floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spacious .
after that , the man , who , after information from his lawyer , was re@@ located again on the open foot , was laid in a larger cell .
his presidential election due to complic@@ ity conditions against the Federal Republic of Berlin was false though .
however , the Constitutional Court took up the verdict of the Berlin Chamber of Court and rejected the case for a renewed test .
they see the man &apos;s human dignity .
Chamber of Appe@@ als now decides about the amount of compensation
although legally for legal reasons , only a few days of arrest for the compensation had to be decisive , it was issued a compensation . it was stated .
otherwise , &quot; a mis@@ carriage of the right to fear the personality is to fear . &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ als must now clari@@ fy the amount of money damage .
the Constitutional Court has often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
so they said in April , a prisoner of damages because he was imprisoned in a prison cell .
human un@@ worthy is also an agreement of 2011 , also the majority assignment of a cell without separate toilet .
on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Court of Justice on Wednesday that a det@@ ain@@ ee had agreed to a decent living in a parallel event in November 2009 .
the ch@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff was open daily between 15 and 21 hours a day , between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe company .
the Berlin j@@ ails came from the headlines in recent weeks as well .
det@@ ain@@ ees are therefore always included in 23 hours , while the aggressi@@ veness rises , even to slaughter men it is supposed to have come to slaughter .
according to the Ministry of Justice , 21 places in te@@ gel are not occupied due to young people , 19 will exp@@ ire in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
immigration from refugees is an enormous challenge - the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture this year , according to the title of Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge determination : &quot; I say again and again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can do this and we &apos;re g@@ onna make it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following overview , what comes in Germany , gives the following overview .
according to varying grades between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Education ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institut ) dwell@@ ings annually - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatically bad , but above all in affordable ten@@ ants : each year 60 000 to 80@@ 000 social apartments come out of rent , and in order to apply these particularly convenient apartments also refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) aims to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is this from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social homes had to be mod@@ elled annually and would have to invest a funding in the amount of 6.4 billion dollars annually .
we agree , scientists and state minister in it , that it must also provide more tax advantages for investment in residential construction .
according to the Institute for Employment Research ( Institute for Employment Research ) estimates that 55 percent of the poultry in Germany can be employed in Germany .
however , the refugees in Germany would not even ask for their quali@@ fications to help them get their entry , Claudia Walter , the Project Manager for Integration and Education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Foundation .
the integration of refugees , however , is crucial if they find work in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour is the key to social contacts for the appreciation of the society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ u@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , it has been a political turning point in Germany : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prohibition of labour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the recognition of labour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while earlier an employment ban on asylum seek@@ ers increased by up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as the resi@@ den@@ ces for asylum seek@@ ers to a place of asylum .
in society , - also because of the skilled labour market - mainly the way of view that refugees should be allowed to allow refugees to gain access to the labour market .
a great hur@@ dle for access to the job market are missing . German .
previously there is no sufficient offer to offer in general and professional language courses .
research shows also that jobs most often are medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
the construction of networks is therefore , according to th@@ ron@@ hardt , the p@@ inn@@ acle of work integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children into the day@@ cares , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the ro@@ oted parents , it is only once important to hold the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ sch@@ emer , Speaker for Youth and Family in the Senate Administration .
to convince the family , however , to persu@@ ade the advantages of the put@@ a , the public covers in various languages .
should the need to increase teachers by the large number of refugees would attempt to increase the Berlin Senate to ex@@ ert the training capacity - for example by driving more skilled schools .
in the countries pupils are prepared without German knowledge in welcome classes .
but they are not always taught by being trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack in them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ations from the Berlin School office .
the German student leader estimates that around 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle no Federal State of asylum seek@@ ers or Ged@@ ul@@ sed the study - the only exception to date was Berlin , God@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) but abandoned its attitude .
studio @-@ informed refugees could be reli@@ eved of access to the university .
for refugees with a common laundry or Dul@@ ce can no longer receive any services under the asylum seek@@ er law , if they start to study .
the latter is basically not a B@@ af@@ ö@@ G because they do not fall under the circle of deposits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ged@@ ticul@@ ous refugees had to have been living in Germany for four years so far , to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ G as of January 1 , 2016 , this span is reduced to 15 months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this gap must also be concluded , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Student Union .
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ G .
in future Islam will play a more important role in future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should be rec@@ iting the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and to further develop the existing state @-@ churches right to a new state @-@ religions relationship .
it would also be the founding of an Islamic welfare association , who takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
the rights belong also .
so , the representative of Islam must be part of some and ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and to create certain control possibilities .
the read@@ iness , to take lev@@ y against religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism belong to this , too .
the chairman of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , said on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts could be entered by Germany as well .
those who wanted to au@@ tho@@ red such conflicts in Germany would immediately have their right , here at times , in Germany , &quot; he said in the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
he suggested to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will soon be a lot more in the future than today .
the majority society , therefore , will change the breakdown of discrimination and rac@@ ism .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has since been a scar@@ ce for a decade of anti @-@ discrimination and a General Management Act .
but it lear@@ ns very slowly as the NSU @-@ series , in which police and authorities were systematically ignor@@ ant the rac@@ ist motif .
equal opportunities for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and the interest groups are non @-@ tw@@ ei@@ ving German already and for the international agreement as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention in Germany must be in reality when the country will remain peac@@ efully and to use their new citizens - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany was able to medi@@ cally care for the expected refugees , the state president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery believes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as to Man@@ - Power and Capacities , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must be flowing into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery requests to vali@@ date all submission to the registration of health cards .
carried out , services may later be rep@@ uted with the federal states .
and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to cut so many people with the limited performance of the Company , which see asylum seek@@ ers .
otherwise , the doctors make the doctors in particular the language barriers .
until now , the Berlin health scientist the@@ a Bor@@ de studied , migrants should be worse than other patients &apos; health education .
not only in clinics , even in medical practices would have to be incur@@ red , calls for them .
many immigrants would also be helped with more general practition@@ ers in the emergency ambul@@ ance .
and with another diagnostic glance .
among the refugees there is a much more un@@ treated disability , and the young people go to an HIV @-@ En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment .
with the other rare cases of disease , German doctors came from their formation but clearly , Mont@@ gom@@ ery points out .
&quot; paras@@ ite incident or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; and which affects the deficiency , may be even bl@@ ur@@ red by the refugees even alle@@ vi@@ ating in sight .
the Syrians have a highly developed education system , some refugees even were physicians .
in order to practice , however , they would have to demonstrate their quali@@ fications , and re@@ prove v@@ ex@@ changes again .
at least half of the refugees in Germany over the coming week remains psych@@ ologically ill according to the estimates of the Federal Chancellor ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) psych@@ ically : most suffer from post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
especially vulnerable to refugee children , Dietrich Mun@@ z says , President of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recent study by TU Munich demonstrated that every fifth Syrian refugee child trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
who is affected by post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer@@ eth , among other things , to @-@ called Flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , dizziness , ar@@ ni@@ es , and death scar@@ ves .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong terror and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to prevent symptoms of chronic diseases such an early treatment was necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
to date , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive a psycho@@ therapist .
while psychological illness for asylum seek@@ ers in the social offices provide a request for psycho@@ therapy , the processing usually lasts several months .
in addition , social workers are usually non @-@ trained , or doctors who are not trained for mental illness , whether a therapy is necessary or not .
these often lead to false ass@@ essments , says Mun@@ z .

Sim@@ il@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down the stair@@ case at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread rapidly through the social media .
the opening of the parliamentary report was also clou@@ ded by claims of the opposition from the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them against Mr Mu@@ gabe was to be accompanied by Mr Mu@@ gabe .
last month they had blind@@ ed him and given him to the situation of the Nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ esis said that seven Op@@ tions politicians have received SMS messages on their cell phones that warned them against Mr. Mu@@ ch &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said journalists to Mu@@ gab@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the Parliament &apos;s affected Parliament that the immun@@ ity ends in parliament , and when they aband@@ on parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Hewlett @-@ Packard will disman@@ tle up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to disman@@ tle 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year HP will divide up in two listed companies and split the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its services business activities .
the expected job reduction leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation .
&quot; this restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , which is to conduct the unit after separation .
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and profound portfolio of shops that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion in turnover and &quot; will be focused on the provision of previously un@@ att@@ ain@@ able , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such as a company &apos;s explanation .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930 &apos;s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett @-@ Dave Packard , to produce electric plants and the Palo Alto Garage man called &quot; the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has a massive re@@ structure through to tackle the return of traditional computers to mobile devices .
the operation of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area that is based on the belief that focused companies bringing a better performance .
FC Arsenal captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says team @-@ mates at the game of Dynam@@ o Zagreb have to stand behind the final Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere .
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it wasn &apos;t until September and if his rehabilitation runs according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas again .
this optim@@ istic scenario indicates that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will be sure to miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history his role in the European Championship will certainly certainly be uncertain .
the great shame on this recent problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate squ@@ ank@@ le injury , and then returned to its old moment@@ um during the pre@@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of violation of risk is not threatened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a bone that was not well healed .
it is no major issue .
it was just an accident .
it wasn &apos;t in connection with his Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries , which he had previously .
this may be true from purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognised , there is the related threat of further injuries , always when a player tries to return in the middle of season .
it also developed a unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has found 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years ago .
he also played in only 65 from Arsen@@ y &apos;s 157 music games in the last five times .
the wider image of Arsenal is that in six out of eight game times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs were clubs that have the most vulnerable days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil &apos;s circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the physical quota will last over during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have an accumulated period , a time in which you have to strengthen your body and win battle power , &quot; stated Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career out of the way he deserves .
Arsenal starts his Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea in Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on the next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger raises himself a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey travelled to Croatia , which means Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta must be used .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need it to indul@@ ge a small inter@@ mission , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although arsen@@ al clear favor@@ ites are supported by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the largest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 playing after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday when the Richter scale was 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that arsen@@ al has drawn the doctrine of the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains of the distant hope , to lead the association for its first Europ@@ e@@ oc@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immen@@ sely &quot; , &quot; stated Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked for arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I am a long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .
friendship Fest : the Com@@ edy Show , which gave us serious lessons about men &apos;s friendly relationships
the lack of similar presentations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open , now more dou@@ bt@@ ful than ever has become , prove just like suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged between 20 and 45 in Great Britain , and it remains more common in men than women .
in an effort to address the problem , Camp@@ aign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ania ( CA@@ LM - Camp@@ aign against a pi@@ tiful life ) 2015 was announced as the year of a man with the aim to ask the culture in question that men hin@@ der to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the cent@@ er@@ piece in the struggle to master this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with de@@ pressed symptoms confirmed that if the suffering has had a sufficient high percentage of friends with a &quot; healthy mood , &quot; doubled their chances on recovery .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mental healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course , one must first have friends to work with it for friendship .
in the age of more than social media , communication with its focus on style above substance is the dis@@ ability of the answer , often more important than a significant contact .
our digital life have doubled the need to get strong , fun and successful in reality , even though in reality the isolation is domin@@ ating .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ tr@@ ins@@ ic values : money , image , social status , all at cost in@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner vision for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy money .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was put on the head .
each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ ined by interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Chand@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football tar@@ ts in cozy arm@@ chairs and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all that came out of the knowledge that men can definitely refer to , even if they often return to explore fully their feelings .
as one employee of the telephone past@@ oral care came to me : ... &quot; my listening role for people who are de@@ pressed by depres@@ sive and self @-@ m@@ ating , really clearly showed me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us are often not able to talk to friends .
the old phr@@ ases , &quot; I come along with it , &quot; has an enormous effect as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to me in the sense when I try to offer long @-@ term gra@@ zing mechanisms .
she presents quite clearly the little moments of men &apos;s friends .
so very my objective ou@@ tri@@ ght status of phone calls may also help people in the despair of despair , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit the Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ ship Fest in which celebration of the day is completely new setting , so why don &apos;t you take friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , when you &apos;ll keep walking alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference might be your friendship .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to end - the total 236 Ep@@ is@@ den - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets PS@@ G to help solve Malmö .
angel Di Mary celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malmö .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass over to Malmö .
here are the Game Report and the response to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani showed a course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the home @-@ car stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ s as PS@@ G player , who brought the French master to the road , but afterwards they missed a series of opportunities before finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani achieved a head office in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A you need a strong start against the Swedish masters because they are not only aiming for quali@@ fications for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ laps , but a improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ alists in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was no class example of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mov@@ able chances of winning the goal . he was later in the game against his home @-@ home team and against the club , with whom he started his har@@ k@@ ens career already in the year 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or down@@ ward in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to win our opponents to cause problems and to back home , even if there are certain things that we need to experience in the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; that is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we have won , although I am sorry that we didn &apos;t even have one or two other goals . &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that was able to hold a 2 : 2 deci@@ ding on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was exp@@ elled in the fourth minute by Di Mary .
the Argent@@ in@@ ean wing collapse has been considered as the man to take the PS@@ G onto the next level in Europe , when he entered into the last month of Manchester United , when he entered in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malmö defense , before he finished in Johan Wil@@ ders in the long corner of the network .
however , if someone believed P@@ PS@@ G would win a big victory , he was disappointed .
Malmö , the Celtic way of Play @-@ off hit this stage in order to reach this level , represented at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine nation@@ players on the field and was rounded up with a five @-@ man defense , and two deep in the middle .
but apart from Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who went far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they drove little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave himself sometimes with some patches with flaws and bad agreements , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who had no less than five attempts in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had started to re@@ boot after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless he proved a lot more cre@@ ase when he brought his fel@@ lows into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , turning the Di Mary into a shooting down , passing by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the poles ...
finally , the second gate fell short after the hours stamp to Cav@@ ani . however , the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans had his sixth win after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had caught a left flan@@ k by Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malmö gets back in the game , and only an outstanding backing from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the final result before the substitute Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi receive a gate at the end .
the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later announced that PS@@ G played a class about his team , and the Norwegian has said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year .
since then we played only in the Swedish league which didn &apos;t have the same level .
the qualifying games do not suff@@ ice . &quot;
hats off from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak to Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NO APO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once again they were one of the best teams in the bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are one of the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly against Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the T@@ wins secured a chance to climb from Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , although it was only for an evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so difficult to gr@@ asp on a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter what it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ m .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon held his early offensive support when Detroit took three times in the first two Inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) pointed out 6 times in the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and enabled three r@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his final nine games .
&quot; I &apos;m going to finish this year , &quot; Simon said .
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen each game , and therefore I want to go into the game .
the designated Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two rations , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ time hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , ever since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; he has carved the kn@@ ap@@ wood well , &quot; he said .
he looked good at the ( drum@@ ming ) , looked clearly better out of the Bull@@ dog , and he brought it right into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the rear , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back into the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
Right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a colourful , and Simon took his second b@@ ade Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy left @-@ handed .
Har@@ dy went over to the wall , the only man who was confron@@ ted with whom he was faced with the designated Rookie schl@@ ager Miguel S@@ ano , who plan a two @-@ run from the right @-@ handed three @-@ h@@ agen .
with a pair of buyers and the closing @-@ run during the second , Ver@@ h@@ agen came to the third b@@ ade of Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe at a double play .
it was the 27 @-@ th anniversary of the major league for the 27th time in this season , making plans to play Double Play
after Detroit arrived at the end of the ninth interior of the Insurance @-@ Run , Berlin managed to create a R@@ BI double against the bri@@ dle of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored 5 to 4 .
the right @-@ handed stamp , however , came from S@@ ano with three pit@@ ches for his fifth leg .
Detroit makes the start of the game by a still non @-@ mobile Phil Hughes .
the tig@@ ers achieved three install@@ ments in the first two Inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed @-@ veter@@ an , who had been canc@@ eled before the game of the physical list , after he had been missing for a month more than a month .
&quot; obviously not the beginning that I had wished for , &quot; Hughes , &quot; but I felt better when I started and felt that I would make some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter in the first they gave a single to second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z playing the game that made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z abol@@ ished his 0 @-@ 21 success @-@ series with Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third b@@ ade Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third that ended the threat .
the tig@@ ers scored a One @-@ Out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center F@@ iel@@ e Anthony G@@ osis to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a great stroke , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he hasn &apos;t really defeated very well , but he got the right spot .
Hughes was on a pitch @-@ count , no points scored in the third inning before it was replaced by the Rel@@ ie@@ ver right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hughes , there came three hits with six hits and a walk with four Stri@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal Sanchez left the case due to a violation of throwing training .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who had operational the shoulder from Sanchez in 2007 .
Sanchez , on the middle of August on the po@@ ck@@ les list due to a shoulder @-@ stop , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with Sán@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is kn@@ itted from the level of po@@ ck@@ les to win against T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with Tiger , ever since he was acquired during the exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30 , 2009 .
he was missing on 20 August due to a di@@ stortion in the right hip joint .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4@@ 43 ER@@ A ) is present against Minnesota &apos;s R@@ HP Er@@ vin Santana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )

his negative impressions was likely to have re@@ affir@@ med him in his later struggle against Rome in his later struggle .
in addition to his Th@@ eses against deposits , Luther was initiated the split of the evening in the evening .
a Hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dorn@@ enk@@ rone is one of the main works by Ot@@ mar Alt for his bi@@ ble .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and updated the Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with superb pictures .
in the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who inspired his very personal interpretation of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 designs .
its &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means equ@@ alled with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : adapted the respective issues , this may well be quite dark .
for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he made a sub@@ jective @-@ artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books . &quot;
these are cycles , on topics like crosses , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or pat@@ ern@@ ity .
thereby he has equally fascinating several partners : this is true for the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation , as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its focus on art books .
and there is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has been on the basis of painting with their respective fields .
he analysed the interpre@@ ts from Ot@@ mar Alt and so today , into current relationships . &quot;
these texts are as composite mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
nestled in between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and each of the artist , his very personal thoughts about the situation here .
the jewelry set has golden spoon .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old has almost a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
it is a high level of in@@ timacy .
emotions had ultimately been trig@@ gers for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant ruler .
&quot; the education was already happening with the cane , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt rec@@ alls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to leave that , to re@@ sign me again with the Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to re@@ lie@@ ve art in faster time again : &quot; the perception of vision worlds is shaped by advertising , and that is noisy .
symbol@@ ism is being pushed out there .
artists have a delight and desire to show things .
pictures have always something mysterious and are not decor@@ atively decorative .
&quot; in this regard I am a dinosau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewers to &quot; look up &quot; in the pictures &quot; to appear , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; the image is looking for his counter@@ action . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost started on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; Al@@ as always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst : &quot; I like how to compreh@@ end with his pictures . &quot;
old , I have not considered to compreh@@ end the Bible completely , but the most important for him , also mysterious subjects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no collaboration at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Here is the pictures , the text explained merely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was written in the Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öhler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to shed his life and freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öhler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and fla@@ x images - will be presented in an exhibition on November 15 at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .

so hill deported , new place - now with formal planning and application for construction permits .
this permission was to go in October , the First Church of Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bock was now able to express his report in the child &apos;s youth and youth affairs committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will have seen more visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without a &quot; further act of commem@@ oration &quot; there should be started with the work at the former indoor pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees from 2019 , in the Bundesliga a clear sign .
football re@@ acts to the spl@@ end@@ able situation in Germany and sec@@ ures the policy of helping to overcome the upcoming issues .
&quot; I think it &apos;s the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ union . &quot;
&quot; no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t work me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with that . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be done every single interest to get this topic in the handle &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he plans to discuss the refugee situation in Germany inten@@ sely .
&quot; I am the next Wednesday in the Chancell@@ ery and meet the Minister of State , Mrs Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ uz and the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced .
the football might and wool can help .
but the decisive turn@@ outs needs to have the policy .
the German soccer federation has therefore expanded his refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a &quot; Welcome &quot; for four years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach , at the br@@ ink of the UEFA conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some Federal li@@ gi@@ sts also support this programme .
this weekend , the 36 celeb@@ rat@@ ory symptoms cover an obvious sign , unless the usual sponsor@@ ship of the Left &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens Sport@@ head Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler to the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) , described the project as a &quot; self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the refugee @-@ drama goes everyone , nobody can look away . &quot;
&quot; we can do football Federal leaders , no , we must use our radiation , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly well , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot;
for the EM quali@@ fier against Hungary this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
Nier@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; a large communal ship German soccer . &quot;
the fact that all 36 license agreements had started their own projects , was great .
the same thing is that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which we spent will live in the football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
in this and next year , the association will collabor@@ ate with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government each 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the associations created the whole of 2015 also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP board member loses an eye for accident
President Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t &apos;s leader of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has reportedly lost the left eye through a fall of July .
after the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the US he fell to midnight on a water @-@ glass , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost bloo@@ dless , was s@@ wo@@ oned and dra@@ gged out into the street - he told us so telling the last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP @-@ Co @-@ founder of Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could go on his work .
&quot; in early October , we meet before the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager will be at the meeting and are &quot; fully working . &quot;
in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday issue ) , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will return to Germany in October and further lead the software group .
&quot; I am full of SAP since , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was standing in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t said the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t often comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal history , said the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everyone can happen to something . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to re@@ stand again when you come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the national player is also missing the soccer player in the soccer league in the Du@@ el with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 : 00 PM / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we can &apos;t gr@@ asp him back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el said on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if R@@ eus will be back in the Bundesliga in the Bundesliga match with Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach left : &quot; we expect a return from him to practice on Friday . &quot;
with the high load of his pros , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change his regular eleven position at the eus position .

robot cars : government wants pioneers for Germany
according to the will of the federal government , Germany should be the way to change the vehicle &apos;s technological pioneering .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fore@@ sees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the Autom@@ ate Show at the IAA of a &quot; new Mobility Age . &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and responsible for less st@@ akes , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
he also wants to discuss the subject with his counter@@ parts from the G7 countries , which also comes together with representatives of the industry .
the strategic pioneer of the traffic of the road , amongst other things , empha@@ sizes the importance of the mobile broadband expansion and a continuous increase in digital radio stations .
during testing new technology there is currently a test route on the motorway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional Dis@@ claim@@ er risks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the federal government will examine the legal framework conditions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus Germany wants to use internationally for an international basis that the allow@@ able maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars will be raised from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to use an amend@@ ment to the Vienna Convention , which only sees people as a driver .
when driving , driving through the car , the car will take the lead , the driver becomes more and more passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that detect the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Ministry , automated driving on motor@@ ways will be technically feasi@@ ble until 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , drivers on public roads are expected to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expected far from 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the Germany site appreciate the authors of the study to approximately 8.4 billion euros by 2025 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the digital networking of the P@@ k@@ ws can lead to greater safety and efficiency in traffic , &quot; said SPD traffic politician S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l .
the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data has to be clari@@ fied clearly .
but the Germans do not even look skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
one on Wednesday &apos;s AA @-@ based survey of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the testing phase DE@@ K@@ RA will result in the fact that only eight percent of Germans think that autonomous passenger cars will continue to prevail in the next ten years , 32 per cent not believe in 20 years , 31 percent believe not at all .
in France , 21 percent of those surveyed by 2025 have an autonomous passenger car in the US , 33 per cent .
anyway , the drivers in Germany are not willing to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey carried out by the Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire ride on all roads .
on the motorway could you imagine no more than 15 per cent in running traffic , in the St@@ au 45 percent .
well each viol@@ ated the car would not leave control under any circumstances .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are strong enough , even without Timo to get the title , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bun@@ gee trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ Head , during the EM course of Düsseldorf , Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for a enf@@ ant
it is a mixture of a great fashion show and a wax figures @-@ Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday .
the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , that are sc@@ ary thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , which out@@ fits the great star of the fashion scene , among other things , with Mad@@ onn@@ as and so that he put males in skir@@ ts .
&quot; I can &apos;t say today that I &apos;m enf@@ ant and the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was quite light , meanwhile it is real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gaul@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk to The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is seen from September 18th on in the Kunsth@@ alle des Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation , it is a good luck that the fashion designer has changed his first glance at a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he would have been against it , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me a show was made a little after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been in the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station before .
&quot; it &apos;s going to be so much more than just beautiful garments , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren !
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the man &apos;s history , whose fashion history has written , without ever completed an apprentic@@ eship .
chron@@ ologically the vision is not built , but it is a superb chore@@ ographer , for which much expenditure was done : to recre@@ ate the d@@ olls , for example , an styl@@ ist was especially involved .

shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest , there was still a special gift : a leather tro@@ user @-@ out@@ fit with cork .
Heidi meets Madonna .
he has always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gaul@@ tier said .
the G@@ aul of old ted@@ dy is to be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , strong fashionable walk@@ ways of the design .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted to his Teddy B@@ HS and clothes , Gaul@@ tier said .
with a pupp@@ et , his parents would not have allowed him to play .
he taught fashion to be dis@@ car@@ ded after@@ ward .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers expressed as Gaul@@ tier in Munich .
then I bought it later on , of course .
for his initial fashion show he did not pay the models .
they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ aus@@ ed tip as a fashion shoulder
earlier , it went to the long nitrogen machines in and around pl@@ ush about meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips arose in great quantity for customers , for example , to carry out blank@@ ets and curtains .
the only works today doesn &apos;t work anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of fashion lovers .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early hours of the pl@@ ot@@ ted top fashion played a major role , then it was pushed by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt includes some examples : top in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion that re@@ jects in past bul@@ lets , an increasing client of the potential .
who serves no niche in Germany in the textile industry , is no longer on the market .
with us , they already make up half of all orders .
fashion lovers Pl@@ auen is joined together with nine other companies in the industry association Pl@@ au@@ t@@ ener and embroi@@ der@@ ies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
in the last 15 years , some 80 percent of the turnover are broken .
there are almost no more private trade stores and the wholesale markets .
our products do hardly reach the customers on this road .
mass goods are much cheaper in the Asian region , and almost exclusively run through chains .
in addition , the weak@@ est export , currently to Russia and the USA .
enough reasons for new paths .
the industry association attempted to score well through environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the embroi@@ dery in Falk@@ enstein : &quot; we have been introducing a quality label for this year , that we are environmentally @-@ friendly and soci@@ ally toler@@ ated . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
Jean @-@ designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berger Frühling - University of Applied Sciences - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - speci@@ alis@@ es in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
in order to opp@@ ose the competition from the Asian space , you need to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
the conflict between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the factories , which need to think mainly economically , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , an existing design should only be made easy to keep a customer base .
a few years ago , Kat@@ i Re@@ uter builds the historic snow brand new .
the machine rocks small ch@@ ili@@ es at some places .
the ch@@ au@@ re Gold@@ sch@@ mie@@ de Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Krau@@ se was inspired by the fact : &quot; before , I was unable to start with traditional pl@@ ot@@ ers . &quot;
now she uses the snow @-@ pointed tip for its jewelry .
in an elabor@@ ate process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people of the region identify themselves with the topic of pl@@ ot@@ ted tip - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is also provided in the United States , Australia and Finland - especially to customers who have lived in touch and surroundings , with our ancestors and their ancestors .
with this I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of pl@@ ot@@ ener .

XI p@@ ushes to open the economy bro@@ ader for the world
the economy has to open broad@@ ly to the outside to fo@@ ster growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday to a group which was commissioned with steering the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should aim to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business ventures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Management Board for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new start @-@ ups to promote and promote reform will bring new moment@@ um and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , X@@ i said .
the leadership group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a neg@@ ativity to the regulation of market access , Rel@@ ax@@ ing the Border Security Policy , promotion of state companies ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the inhabitants of Mel@@ t@@ system .
after the statement , a negative note will be created , the sectors and businesses identified , which will not come into question .
the system is tested and tested by test programs .
the initiative is of importance since it refers to the market a major role in allocation of resources , which ensures non @-@ law business environment and open the market open , said the statement .
the Government also will ease inspec@@ tions about the firms that are transferred to the company , and ensure that businesses will decide how to manage their businesses .
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of border @-@ border business coordination and new mechanisms in promoting regional growth .
within the range of an offer , state @-@ controlled sectors will open further areas of private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the lawful interests of foreign investors and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , for foreigners it is easier to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card , &quot; by making the requirements optimised and the application process will be facil@@ itated .
the Law@@ yer &apos;s right to guarantee their activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a session .

EU wants to double @-@ cut mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ors
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ or and consumers with a significantly higher dose of the nervous system .
the Consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who is a well known job paper for the EU , critic@@ ised the plans for industrial and environmental policy , and filled with full impact of pregnant and small children , &quot; says Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values for large fish are to be raised at the end of the food chain as for example Hai@@ - or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic policy consider@@ ations &quot; from one to two milli@@ gram mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
big pre@@ dat@@ ors are , however , strongly polluted with mercury that are not allowed to be sold on the basis of the applicable limit values of about 50 percent of the sizes .
after dou@@ bling of the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be infinite .
in return for this sl@@ ack@@ ening , the EU according to F@@ ood@@ watch aims to exac@@ erb@@ ate the limit values of other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ gram to 0,1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller Fried@@ man , such as car@@ p usually bur@@ dened as low as the planned maximum value is already today .
the sin@@ king in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ ance of di@@ stra@@ ction maneu@@ ver that helps the economy alone , &quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt explained .
mercury is a high @-@ toxic heavy metal that has strongly enriched over the food chain especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes .
the German government therefore warns that &quot; small quantities particularly could cause severe damage to the nervous system . &quot;
the Federal Ministry of Environmental Information declares that an &quot; health threat of the general population &quot; is not expected to be expected .
mercury is released primarily through coal combustion into the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Environmental Department , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ no@@ du@@ ck ordered more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total population in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish around El@@ be , the Rhine and the Donau River was &quot; permanently and nationwide . &quot; had the &quot; Mir@@ ror &quot; quoted from the paper in March .
last year , pan @-@ wide war@@ nings of mercury in fish included the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system R@@ AS@@ FF .
