agreement in the form of a post @-@ change between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobilization of the demands of Member States within the medium @-@ term financial crisis .
the B@@ IS could conclude stand@@ by @-@ credit agreement with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries , if the banks face a corresponding request .
the agreement could be closed down to the total amount of contribution to the mechanism paid to the mechanism , and within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 bn of accounts ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future generations of the member states .
however , it is already mentioned below a few conditions to which the BI@@ Z would be ready .
at each stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ Z would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions , without requiring a total of five years .
in the opening of the loans as well as at the slow@@ ing extension , the BI@@ Z would charge a credit @-@ charge .
in addition , the first lists should not be made before the expiry of a month after the conclusion of the stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to their own liqui@@ dity .
the drawing would be made available in the currencies at the disposal of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would act in consideration of the bank &apos;s funds , expected three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those which the BI@@ Z apply to similar conditions under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market operations .
however , if the B@@ IS has to proc@@ ure the required means by itself on the market , then the required interest rate could be a maximum , which corresponds to a corresponding margin of Li@@ bor .
I would be grateful if you would like to inform me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ Z could conclude stand@@ by @-@ credit agreement with central banks of the creditors , if the banks face a corresponding request . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the form of a post @-@ change between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ inian republic , on the trade with Hamm@@ el and L@@ amm@@ ar
I honour myself to take on the recent negotiations between our delegations for defining provisions on the import of Hamm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from Argentina into the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat . during the course of these negotiations , the two parties are as follows :
- fresh or cool@@ ed Hamm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat ( 02 01 A IV a ) ) ;
as part of this agreement , the export options for Hamm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat of Argentina are set to the following annual amount : 20 000 tons , expressed in battle @-@ body weight ( 1 ) .
to ensure a flaw@@ less functioning of the agreement , Argentina is obliged to ensure by appropriate procedures that the actual amount did not exceed the specified amount and executed in accordance with the conventional supply forms ( frozen or cool@@ ed ) .
should a change in the supply form will be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties in this agreement consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the number 10 mentioned committees , in order to find adequate solution .
in the event that the community particip@@ ates the prot@@ ector @-@ clause , it is obliged to take care of the fact that this agreement will not be touched in this agreement with access to Argentina &apos;s common market .
in the event that the boarding came from Argentina in a year that exceed the agreed amounts , the community reserves the right to set out Argentina for the rest of the same year .
the community comm@@ its itself to restrict the added value to all the products collected by this agreement on a high net of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em to limit .
when entering new Member States , the community in consultation with Argentina changes the number 2 fixed volumes according to the extent of Argent@@ inian trade with each new member state .
the import duties for these new Member States are set in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this will be taken into account number 5 named Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ satz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total amount is set in number 2 , with the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community at 23 000 tonnes of battle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Community takes everything to avoid market development , which could affect the marketing of Argent@@ in@@ ean Hamm@@ el and L@@ amm@@ ers on the joint market within the agreed amounts .
in particular , the Community makes precau@@ tions , so that the paragraph of interven@@ tional associations on frozen flesh is not under@@ min@@ ed in accordance with the implementation of the regulation of Argent@@ in@@ ic Hamm@@ el and L@@ amm@@ ar .
taking into account the objectives and regulations of this agreement , the community agreed that any actual use of fatigue or other lam@@ bs , as well as to the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs takes place only at prices and conditions that are consistent with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community on world trade with these products .
these terms are compatible in a way that is compatible with Article XVI of G@@ AT@@ T and in particular article 10 ( 2 letters c ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the Universal customs and trade agreement .
Argentina guarantees the compliance with this agreement , in particular that the amounts issued by export licenses for the products specified under number 1 in this agreement .
the Community committed itself to meeting all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issu@@ ance of import licenses for the aforementioned products with origin in Argentina is dependent on the presentation of an export license which is in charge of by the Argent@@ in@@ ean government .
the details for the application of this system will be defined so that the position of a deposit for issuing the import of import can be disp@@ osed of .
in Imple@@ mentation specifications , it is determined that the competent authority in the responsible authority of the community has been given in regular intervals , for export licenses ; these details are necessary to en@@ code to the destination country .
the Committee is concerned that the agreement is properly applied and smooth .
he regularly reviews the tendency on the Hamm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat market of both parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets including the conditions imposed by the number 7 named aim .
the Committee is concerned that the proper use of this agreement is not affected by the fact that products from Hamm@@ el - , Lamb , and goat meat should not be carried out under the agreement named Tari@@ ff numbers .
the Committee deals with questions about the implementation of these agreements and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement are beyond the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the number 2 fixed annual amount is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 .
the amount adopted by the entry into force of this agreement to the 1 . January of the following year is set in proportion to the total @-@ year amount and carries the seasonal character of trade .
this agreement applies to the areas where the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and according to that contract , on the one hand , and for the Republic of the Republic of Argentina , on the other hand .
it is valid up to 31 March 1984 ; after that date it remains in force , subject to the right of every party , to cancel it in writing with a period of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be checked by the two parties before the 1 . April 1984 with regard to changes they need to understand .
I would be grateful if you would like to inform you of the consent of your government .
I adore to confirm the receipt of your present letter with the following statement :

in the form of an envelope between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Eastern Uruguay on the trade with Hamm@@ el and L@@ amm@@ ar
I honour myself to take on the recent negotiations between our delegations for defining provisions on the import of Hamm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay into the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat . during the course of these negotiations , the two parties are as follows :
- fresh or cool@@ ed Hamm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat ( Tari@@ f@@ place 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the Common Cust@@ oms Tari@@ ff ;
- frozen Hamm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat ( Tari@@ ff 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the Common Cust@@ oms Tari@@ ff .
as part of this agreement the export options for Hamm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay are set to the following annual amount :
to ensure a flaw@@ less functioning of the agreement , Uruguay , by appropriate procedures ensure that the total amount did not exceed the specified amount and executed in accordance with the conventional supply forms ( frozen or cool@@ ed ) .
should a change in the supply form will be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties in this agreement consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the number 10 mentioned committees , in order to find adequate solution .
in the event that the community takes the protection clause in demand , they commit themselves to ensure that the access of the access to the common market will not be touched in this agreement .
in the event that the deposits of Uruguay exceed the agreed amounts in Uruguay , the community reserves the right to set the entry from Uruguay to the rest of the same year .
the community comm@@ its itself to restrict the added value to the entry of the products collected by this agreement on a high net of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em to limit .
in the accession of new Member States , the community in consultation with Uruguay , changes the number 2 fixed volumes according to the extent of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ ischen trade with each new Member State .
the import duties for these new Member States are set in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this will be taken into account number 5 named Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ satz .
the total amount is set in number 2 , with the days of Greece &apos;s accession to the community to 5 800 tons of the body weight .
the Community takes everything to avoid market development , which could affect the marketing of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ ischen Hamm@@ el and L@@ amm@@ ers on the common market within the agreed amounts .
in particular , the Community makes precau@@ tions , so that the paragraph of intervention stocks were not under@@ min@@ ed on the execution of the regulation of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ ic art .
taking into account the objectives and regulations of this agreement , the community agreed that any actual use of fatigue or other lam@@ bs , as well as to the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs takes place only at prices and conditions that are consistent with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community on world trade with these products .
these terms are compatible in a way that is compatible with Article XVI of G@@ AT@@ T and in particular article 10 ( 2 letters c ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the Universal customs and trade agreement .
Uruguay guarantees the compliance with this agreement in particular that the amounts issued by export licenses for the products specified under number 1 in this agreement .
the Community committed itself to meeting all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issu@@ ance of export licenses is dependent on the presentation of a export license , which was designated by the ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an government .
in Imple@@ mentation specifications , it is determined that the competent ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ ische Authority of the competent authority in regular intervals have been issued for export licenses ; these details are necessary to en@@ code to the destination country .
this agreement applies to the areas where the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and according to that contract , on the one hand , and for the territory of the Republic of Eastern Uruguay on the other hand .
it is valid up to 31 March 1984 ; after that date it remains in force , subject to the right of any party , to cancel it in writing with a period of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be checked by the two parties before 1 . April 1984 with regard to changes they need to be necessary .
I would be grateful if you confirm the consent of your government with this writing .

if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its necessary properties should remain at least one year long .
the expiry date of a re@@ agent in cur@@ v@@ a@@ ean form according to the label is at most one year after the last satisfactory result .
the resulting from the cl@@ apping date for dry re@@ agents is geared towards the results of shelf testing ; it is approved by the state super@@ visory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are kept in an atmosphere of iner@@ ated gas or in a vacuum and in the glass containers they have been dried up and which is so locked that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may lose most of 0,5 b.@@ H. of its weight if it is tested through further drying via phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxy@@ d at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm H@@ g within 24 hours .
for the prevention of bacterial growth , the responsible state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or those supplied with the dry re@@ agents supplied ) an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to provide the requirements of specific@@ ity and efficacy .

re@@ agents for blood @-@ group re@@ agents are in such a way and in such quantities , that that in a container may not only carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control cells .
the amount required in a container must be so big that the content may be used to carry out the hosts described in this protocol .
the manufacturer of producer has more than all production levels and controls of re@@ agents for blood @-@ group@@ ing written records .
adequate samples of all rep@@ uted re@@ agents are to retain so long from the laboratory of laboratory , until with some probability the Char@@ ge can no longer be used .
the re@@ agents used for blood group re@@ agents can contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of them represent the effective share , the others are the necessary aids to enhance the effectiveness and conservation of the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are divided according to the origin of their effective proportions in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents do not contain substances of human origin .
on every single tank , a black on white printed label in English and French is to be fixed , the following information contains : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
