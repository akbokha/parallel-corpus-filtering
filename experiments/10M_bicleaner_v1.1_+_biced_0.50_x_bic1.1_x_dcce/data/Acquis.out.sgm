<seg id="639">The organization, the community and the States work together, as far as any contracting party is concerned to facilitate the implementation of the backup measures planned in this Convention; they avoid unnecessary double-work on the field of backup measures.</seg>
<seg id="640">The backup measures planned in this Convention will be done so that they are a) no disability represent the economic and technological development in the community or for international cooperation in the field of peaceful nuclear activities, including the international exchange of nuclear material;</seg>
<seg id="641">(B) no undue intervention in the peaceful nuclear activities in the community, especially in the operation of the plant;</seg>
<seg id="642">(C) To be in line with the monitoring of a prudent operating management, as they are needed for the economic and depless implementation of nuclear activities.</seg>
<seg id="643">A) The organisation makes all arrangements to protect business and trade secrets as well as other confidential information from which they have gained knowledge in the implementation of the Convention.</seg>
<seg id="644">II) summarised information on nuclear material, which has been subject to the Convention on this Convention, may be published by the Council and with the consent of the immediate affected states or the community, as far as each of the two parties are affected.</seg>
<seg id="645">(a) For the implementation of backup measures for this Convention, the technological development in the field of security measures will be taken into full account and it will be subject to all efforts to ensure the optimal cost efficiency and application of the basic monitoring of the flow of core material, which after this Convention has been subject to certain strategic points, as far as the current or future technology is possible.</seg>
<seg id="646">(B) To ensure the optimal cost efficiency, for example, the following procedures are applied: I) spatial capacity as a means of setting the material zones for the purpose of the project.</seg>
<seg id="647">III) Focus on the phases of the fuel cycle, which could affect the production, processing, use and storage of core material, from which without further nuclear weapons and other nuclear plants could be made, provided that this does not impede the implementation of the Convention.</seg>
<seg id="648">(a) To implement effective implementation of the securing measures for this Convention, the Community of the Organisation in accordance with this Convention provides information on nuclear material, security measures, and on the characteristics of the installations leading to the implementation of the safety measures relating to this material of Belang.</seg>
<seg id="649">(B) i) The organisation requires only the minimum level of information and data which is compatible with the execution of its tasks after this Convention.</seg>
<seg id="650">II) Information about plants are restricted to the minimum level which is necessary for the application of backup measures with regard to core material, which is subject to the backup measures after this Convention.</seg>

<seg id="652">These data do not need to be overtaken to an organization, provided that they will remain accessible to further testing by the organisation in the premises of the community without further access.</seg>
<seg id="653">A) The organisation promotes the consent of the Community and States to the naming of inspectors for the states.</seg>
<seg id="654">II) raises the community either against a proposed rule or at any time against a contract, the organization of the Community and the States suggests one or more of aging.</seg>
<seg id="655">III) Sollten due to the repetitive refusal of the Community, the naming of inspectors to be disabled, so the Council calls the refusal to discuss it as the Director-General of the Organization - in the following as "the Directorate-General" - with the aim of meeting suitable action to discuss.</seg>
<seg id="656">(B) The community and the countries concerned are taking the necessary steps to ensure that the inspectors in the organization can actually trigger them according to their Convention on the aforementioned tasks.</seg>
<seg id="657">C) The visits and activities of the inspectors of the organization are set up so that i) the possible assment and disorder for the community and the States and for the inspection of peaceful nuclear activities are as low as possible;</seg>
<seg id="658">II) The protection of industrial secrets and other the inspectors of the organization to have made aware of confidential information is ensured.</seg>
<seg id="659">Each state serves as opposed to the organization, including its assets, funds and assets, as well as their inspectors, the corresponding provisions of the Agreement on the prerogatives and liberations of the International Atomic Energy Organization.</seg>
<seg id="660">The backup measures after this Convention will be terminated in relation to core material when the community and the organization had been diluted that the material has been consumed or in a way diluted that it has been used for nuclear measures, which is under the standpoint of the backup measures of Belang, is no longer usable or practically non-recovering.</seg>
<seg id="661">The community notwithered the organisation according to the convention, the transfer of core material from the States, which underlies the backup measures after this Convention.</seg>
<seg id="662">The backup measures for this Convention will be completed in relation to core material, as soon as the recipient state, as envisaged in this Convention, has assumed responsibility for this.</seg>
<seg id="663">The organisation guides documents from which any transfer, and if necessary, the retrieval of the backup measures come out on the given core material.</seg>
<seg id="664">Should Nuclear material, the security measures have been subject to this Convention, in non-nuclear activities, such as the production of alloys or ceramics, so agreed to the community with the organization of such use of the material under which circumstances the backup measures may be ended with regard to this material in regard to this material.</seg>
<seg id="665">II) that the kermaterial during the duration of non-application of the backup measures after this Convention is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons bodies.</seg>

<seg id="667">In the scheme, as far as possible, how long and under what circumstances these backup measures will not be applied.</seg>
<seg id="668">In any case, the backup measures planned in this Convention will once again be applied once the core material is assigned to a peaceful nuclear activity.</seg>
<seg id="669">The organisation will be based on the total amount and composition of this material in the relevant state, or on any passing on such material from that state or states.</seg>
<seg id="670">This explains its consent as quickly as possible; it extends only on matters such as inter alia and subject-bearing provisions and agreements for reporting, but does not include an endorsement or under intelligence of the military activity, and does not refer to the unsuccessful use of the kernel.</seg>

<seg id="672">Arise from the community, the states or individuals who are subject to their sovereignty, but extraordinary costs as a result of a special benefit of the organization, thus reimburse the organization this cost, provided that it has explained in advance.</seg>
<seg id="673">The organization carries in any case the cost of all additional measurements and sampling, which will be demanded by the inspectors of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="674">The Community and States ensure that the liability protection for nuclear damages, including an insurance or other financial security, may be used in accordance with its laws and other regulations, to the organisation and its officials for the purpose of implementing this convention in the same manner as in the nationals of the states.</seg>
<seg id="675">Any claim to the community or state in relation to the organization or the organization towards the organization or a state because of damages from a nuclear accident - which resulted from the implementation of the securing measures after this Convention is regulated in accordance with international law.</seg>
